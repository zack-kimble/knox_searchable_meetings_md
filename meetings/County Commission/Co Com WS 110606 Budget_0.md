| 0:00:20| Commissioner Strauss. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=20)|
| 0:00:24| We have nine members present. Commissioner Brown had told us that he would not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=24)|
| 0:00:29| We have three items on the agenda. Item number one is a discussion regarding a possible RFP for internal audit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=29)|
| 0:00:37| I would like for Mr. Joe Carcello, who is head of our Audit Committee, to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| Mr. Carcello, if you wouldn't mind, give us your name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| This is something that Mr. Carcello had presented to the Internal Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=49)|
| 0:00:54| We asked him to be here today to explain to you his thought process behind that so we could have some discussion as to whether or not this is something we wanted to proceed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=54)|
| 0:01:01| Again, thank you, sir, for your service, and we appreciate you being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Joe Carcello, 1921 Blackheath Road, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| The Audit Committee discussed whether this made sense to consider an RFP for internal audit outsourced services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=71)|
| 0:01:23| Let me give you a little bit of context as to where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| The external auditor of the county, right now KPMG, who does primarily the CAFR and the affiliated entities in the CAFR, is by charter limited to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=86)|
| 0:01:38| This is their fourth year coming up, and so we are precluded from retaining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| We had to do an RFP on the primary external audit services of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=105)|
| 0:01:51| So the Audit Committee discussed whether it made sense to potentially broaden that RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| In addition to the CAFR, we have an audit done of the school activity funds, and that's currently done by Roto-For-Moss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| and there's no restriction on how long Roto-For-Moss could serve, and I don't think anybody's displeased with the work Roto-For-Moss has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| but you don't know what's out there unless you bid the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| And so the Audit Committee discussed the possibility of including an RFP for the school activity funds audit, and we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| So there's an RFP on the street for both what I would call the audit of the main entities of the county, the CAFR, as well as the school activity funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| Firms can bid on one engagement or both engagements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| By bundling, we may get better pricing or better service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Then I raised the issue of internal audit because it's an audit-type service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| It's an internal audit-type service, but it's still an audit service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| and a number of corporations in the private sector will outsource the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| A lot of corporations have it in-house, as we do now, and some organizations co-source, where you have some in-house and some outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| So these are all models that are reasonably prevalent in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| And so as we discussed that, one of the things that came up during our initial conversations was before we did any RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| there would have to be a change in the – and Joe, correct me if I'm not using all the right terms here – charter, bylaws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| No, it'll actually require a change in the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| which outlines the duties, responsibilities, and functions of the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| and that would have to come about by way of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| Okay. And that would have to be through this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| And so what the – if you want to change it, what it would basically say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| and Joe Jarrett's prepared some language that he shared with us the last time we met as an audit committee –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| it basically would give the commission and the audit committee the option of retaining audit services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=230)|
| 0:03:59| either from an in-house function, as we have now, or from an outsourced function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| And that may even mean if commission went ahead and made those changes that we would necessarily do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| In all likelihood, we would, but it wouldn't require us to do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| But what it would do is it would allow commission and the audit committee in the future to have more options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Right now, we have no option other than an in-house service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| If we wanted to outsource, we couldn't even do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| So to me, options are never a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| If we do do an RFP, at a minimum, what it does is it gives us a baseline on price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| We clearly know what we're spending on the internal audit function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Now you know that it's in the county's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| We have no idea what it would cost to outsource the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| So we have no benchmark on pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| So at a minimum, we'd get a benchmark on pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| We may find that we have a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| We may find that an outside vendor could do the same job for less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| We'd also have some degree of benchmarking on what I would call productivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| which is both the number of audit reports that we get per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| and the speed in which we get those audit reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| which are both valid measures of service performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| And we'd also get some, we'd have the ability to compare the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| and the backgrounds of the engagement team if we have an outside vendor bidding on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| and compare that against the qualifications of our in-house staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| It very well may be that we go through this process and we look at the bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| and we decide to stay in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| That's a distinct possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| But at least we would have made an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Right now the decision is by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| We have the function we have, and that's been a fine function for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| but we have nothing to compare it against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| Questions for Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Joe, tell us what is your position at the university?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| I am, this is a long title, the Ernst & Young and Business Alumni Professor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| and the Director of Research for the Corporate Governance Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| You know, you've heard a lot of, you've come out with a lot of suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| but, you know, in your chair of the committee, in your opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| rather than these suggestions and whatnot, Joe, what would you recommend as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| in other words, if this was your ship and you were guiding it, what would you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| I would change the ordinance so that commission and the audit committee have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| to at least do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| And I would do the RFP and I would evaluate the alternatives that exist in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| against the in-house service that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| In terms of ultimately what's my recommendation as to whether we stay in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| or whether we go outside, Commissioner, I can't make that judgment until I know what's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| We will look at that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| Commissioner Wright, Shouse, or Broyles, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| You're on the audit committee, and I'm going to get to Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| but do you have anything you want to add since you are on the committee, Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| I'm in favor of moving forward with this and just so that we can see what the options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| I think that Dr. Carosello has made some good points, especially in terms of having some benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| and being able to do some evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Having more options is, in my opinion, never a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| I agree with Dr. Carosello and Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| I'm not convinced absolutely this is the way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| but I'd like to look at the data coming back from the vendors out there as far as dollars are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| and as far as production and what they could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| I think we're looking at $258,000 this year is what the budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| And if it improves productivity and efficiency of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| I think we need to look and see if we can improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| And if we are convinced that that does improve the production, then we need to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| Commissioner Wright, do you want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| I believe that during the audit committee meeting that we had that was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| I asked why did we even have an internal audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| because I really couldn't think of back to during my time here what generated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| because it seems to exist in code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| And now I'm a little bit better informed about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| and you could probably weigh in a lot more on why we have an internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| But I think the important thing to look at here is not that we need to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| it's just that we need to know what would be the difference between having what we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| and what we would have if we had someone that was outside the organization looking at us with an unbiased eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=543)|
| 0:09:15| I'm not saying we have a biased eye inside right now, because this is commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| The internal auditor works for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| And I think we've got sort of crossed here between the administration keeping up with where the facts and figures are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=565)|
| 0:09:35| and where commission is trying to keep up with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and then we do the whole thing once a year with some outside external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| So, you know, beating around the bush, we have to look at it just to know what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| First of all, did you say that the budget was around $280,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| Was that a correct number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| $258,000, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| I'm just looking at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| $258,000 is what I, $258,000 too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| And how much of that, and I don't know if Richard needs to answer this, or maybe you know, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| How does that break down as far as cost, you know, personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| And, of course, that would include your salary, and we don't need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| But how much of that is personnel cost, and how does that budget break down, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| Could you give us your name and address for the record, please, Richard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=626)|

| 0:10:34| Other than maybe about $10,000 in office expenses, approximately $9,000 to $10,000 office space, the rest of it is salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=634)|
| 0:10:49| And who all do you have in your office right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| What personnel do you have, since most of it is personnel cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Actually, I'll just have them stand up so you can see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| I have David Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| What are their roles or titles or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| David Cox and then Chris Deck are both auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| And then our secretary or administrative assistant is Wanda Abbott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So there's four of us total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| And then back to Dr. Carsella, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| I've talked to several people, and I really haven't formed an opinion whether this is good or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| but one of them said that frequently in corporations that outsource their internal auditing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| these are organizations that really outsource when specific instances come up when they need an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=693)|
| 0:11:43| And a lot of times organizations, that it's a continuous process or there are a lot of audits going on, they keep it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| What really is the, you know, what do we see if we look across the board for similar organizations to ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| as to whether the corporate decision is made to outsource it or keep it in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=718)|
| 0:12:06| I wouldn't agree, Dr. Briggs, with that characterization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| I would agree that a lot of times when you have specific, highly technical audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| that the in-house staff may not have the capability to handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| you'll do something called a co-source where you have the in-house staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| and then you'll hire outside vendors to help you with that particular task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| But in the corporate sector, it's relatively common to have an in-house staff, as we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| but it's also relatively common to outsource the whole function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| Now, you do have to have an officer who the outsourced individuals report to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| But beyond that, I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| When I was in Atlanta, Turner Broadcasting, which is a big company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| outsourced the entire internal audit function to Ernst & Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| And so that's not that uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Now, within the governmental sector, we talked about this at the last audit committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| it's much harder to get hard data on that because it's not public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| And I haven't done any systematic survey of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| But my guess, and I think Richard spoke to this when we met last, it would be less common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| It would clearly be less common to outsource it in the governmental sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| than it would be in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| And I guess my next question is because in the period of time that I've been on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| which is the last little over three years now, we've had several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| Well, there's been a lot of audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| And if we did an RFP on this, would we be doing this as a full-time person that's here at Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| with his staff that I would assume would report to the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| report to the committee that you're the chairman of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| or would we wait until particular problems come up, just some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| I mean, there's been more than this, but we've had the hospitality fund audit, the travel audit, the P-card audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| We've got now the solid waste audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I believe that when we were looking at take-home vehicles and even the parking structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| I believe that Richard may have done some of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Would we say we want you to do everything that's being done right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| or would we just put out RFPs for each one of these as they came up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| I mean, how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| I don't think we'd want to probably do separate RFPs as each issue came up, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| because with all due respect to the very hardworking people in purchasing, it's not a fast process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| And sometimes getting audit work done is time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| And if you lose a few months because of the RFP, that's counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So I think what we would want to do is I think we'd want to bid from them as to what their price would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| to essentially be a full-time internal audit function for us, how many audits we would get per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| that would be embedded in their fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| What would their expectation be as to how many audits we could get per year given that fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| They would have benchmark data as to what we've had done in audits over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| They would probably sit down and talk with Commission or selected members of Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| talk to the Audit Committee, talk to Mr. Troyer, talk to the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| talk to others as to where they see the needs in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| And then they would make a specific proposal both as to dollar amount, specific audit coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| leaving some undefined as unexpected problems came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| and then some expectation as to timeline as to how quickly we would expect audits to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| Would it be monthly, quarterly, so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Just making a general statement, my only concern about outsourcing this is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| and we really don't know if it's going to be more expensive whether we outsource it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| but just knowing what public employees get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| and knowing that a private corporation has to do the same function plus make a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| I think we'd have to be very careful to be sure that when we put this RFP out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| that we're going to get the same services we get now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| And just as I mentioned, some of these, and I'll call them smaller audits that Richard's asked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| and part of the reason just historically that we decided to have an Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| was because he was really getting overwhelmed with too many requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| and we wanted to have a screen and a filter before he was asked to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| to be certain that these were actually things that we wanted him to spend time on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| But if we still have things that we wanted an outside outsourced auditor to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| I think we've got to be careful that we get our money's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| and we're still getting things done that we need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| So I would want the RFP really to be based on some of the historical work that's been done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| so we're really comparing apples to apples in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| and not just having someone to come in to, quote, do the big ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| but even what some people would consider to be some of the more relatively minor audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| that's still important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Right. Yeah, there's a couple of quick responses to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| I couldn't agree more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| And I think one of the benefits of doing this, if you decide to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| is we may very well conclude that we have a great deal in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| And if we conclude that, to me, it validates the internal audit function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| It validates the leadership of the internal audit function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| I think it's good for Commission to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I think it's good for the Audit Committee to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Beyond that, in terms of some of the small tasks that sometimes are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| there are things that Richard's group has been asked to do that aren't really even audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| It's really data gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| And it's not crystal clear to me, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| that in some cases that really shouldn't be handled at a John Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| I just had one other question, and this would be about the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| Usually when we put these RFPs out is that we're intending to accept the best offer for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| Of course, there will not be an offer by the county itself for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| But I guess would we have the option after we put these out to compare those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| to compare the services that would be offered through the RFP versus looking at what we're getting now and the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| We would have the option when we put this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| I think anyone that bids on this would have to understand that even though they may make the best offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| that we may not accept it after we review the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| I'll just make a statement about Richard's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| He's been through some very controversial issues over the last four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| and he's even had some personal attacks that I'm very well aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| And he received some criticism from me at times also, I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| But I don't think that anyone feels that the quality of his work has been affected by pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| that was put on by people outside this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| In spite of a lot of pressure, I think he's given us some quality reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| I think we would get that from an outside auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| but this is not being done because there's a question about him being influenced by outside people on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| And I want to say that for Richard's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Yeah, I agree completely with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Richard, I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Trying to let me get a grasp of what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Dr. Briggs, thank you for those comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| How much do we keep you busy saying, all right, let's audit this or that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| In other words, what percentage of your time last year was county commission driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| that we specifically told you to go after a certain item versus how much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| if you're the auditor, you go out and audit what Richard wants to audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Actually, the last couple years since the audit committee has been formalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| it's been entirely driven by commission through the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| So that's what you've been tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Do you feel with what you're doing or as an auditor that you should be able to make a decision, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| this department is not expecting me to come audit it, now's the time to get them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Not that you expect anything, but you want to go out and audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| It seems to me that you're going to find things when people are not expecting an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| And is that your philosophy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| I mean, I'm not a CPA, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| It works both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| You know, most of our work has been driven by request lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| We do prepare a risk assessment, which evolves into a work plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| which we'll be issuing one probably 1st of July or so where we have a work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| And so not only do we work from the work plan, but we'll also take requests from the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| Incidentally, the solid waste audit was on our work plan also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| And, you know, we also got requested by commission to do it and the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| so it moved up the prioritized list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Do you ever go to the audit committee and say, committee members, I feel that we need to audit this or that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Do you ever make suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Through the work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Or tell our chairman that you feel that we need to audit things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Through the work plan is how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Do we need two audits, Mr. Chairman? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| I may be repeating what's been said, but we do move forward with the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| and it comes back way over what I gave Dr. Briggs, 258,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| That's the budget we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| It's actually 264 proposed going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| So if it were to come back way over that for the production that we're asking for, of course, it's a don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| Don't even look at it or don't even consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| So it would have to come in where, in my opinion, for me to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| a number that was beneficial to the Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| And I agree that Richard has been in some hotly, he's been a pawn somewhat two, three years back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| between opposing political factions and he's performed admirably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| He was often used to get some numbers out, then the gotcha and the counter gotcha and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| I think he performed professionally in that and I compliment him on what he did during those tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| And I think with the Audit Committee, we've moved forward professionally and away from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| and with the Commission's current structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And I thank him for the good work he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Yes, I just wanted to clarify that what we're actually talking about right now is not the structure of the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| or what we would do with an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| This is just a conversation about whether or not we want to change the code so that we could do an RFP if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1389)|
| 0:23:18| And all of this is good conversation and this is conversation that we've had in the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1398)|
| 0:23:25| But what needs to happen on the agenda for our next meeting is do we change the code so that we can do an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1405)|
| 0:23:39| rather than what exactly, what kind of RFP are we going to do and what are we going to ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| and how are we going to evaluate it and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| And that's something that the Audit Committee would have to come up with if we decide to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| So I just don't want us to get bogged down in debate over something that we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| We have to take step one before we take step two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| And again, as a member of the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| none of us have hesitations or concerns at all about our internal auditor and his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1451)|
| 0:24:21| We've all been very pleased with the work that we've received from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| This is just what I think is the responsible step to take as guardians of the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| This is something that we need to do to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Joe Jarrett, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Would this be an ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Would it take two readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| It would, sir, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I don't want to belabor the point, but I, too, agree with everything that's been said about our internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| and his professionalism through a real difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| But I guess, you know, with what Amy just said, this may go against that a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| but I think Dr. Costello brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| So I have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Because when I'm weighing my decision on whether to take step one, I think I heard you say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1513)|
| 0:25:21| step two or three or maybe 20 would be some kind of consolidation of the audits that we're doing on the education piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| as well as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| You know, so at some point I'd like to look at the totality of it and not just the 250-whatever-K that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| So am I kind of correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| You're right on, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| One of the things I had wanted to do, which I'm not sure now is going to be doable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| but I had wanted to enable vendors to at least potentially bid on all three audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| And if you add up what we're paying for internal audit, which is essentially 260,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| and what we're paying for the CAFR audit and what we're paying for the school activity funds audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| it's a significant amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| And often in today's economy, when you bundle services, you'll get very good pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| And, again, that's no reflection at all on Richard's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| I mean, they've done very good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Solid waste audit, I think, is a fine piece of audit work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| But I think we have to at least give ourselves that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| I don't know if we'll have the option now, regardless of what you guys do with this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| because given two readings and so forth, the RFP is already on the street on the other two audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| So it may or may not, it may be too late to bundle all three together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Well, maybe that's a question for Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| You know, an RFP is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| That's a solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| It's not a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| So, I mean, in terms of moving forward, do you see anything in the next, say, three to four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| that would prohibit us from delaying that RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| You know, as soon as we award the RFP, is there immediate work for this outfit that we'd be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| and there's a hard deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Maybe John Troyer, I would have to defer to him on the financial audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| but I would say that the audit committee would have a better idea of that than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Well, you know, just in general, I mean, if there's no pressing need to have that RFP filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| Well, here's the challenge, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| In order to have, John's group has worked very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| in getting the CAFR released now around Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| Rather than the first year we were together, it was well after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| And in order to be able to continue to hit those kind of deadlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| given planning of a new auditor and interim work, John and I have discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| we probably need to have the new external auditor in place by December 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| So that's really the only hard deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Other than that, we have some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| Is that fair, John, wherever he is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Yes, just that this was a topic that we had discussed at the last audit committee, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| was about if we do move forward with an RFP, the benefits of trying to bundle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| But I think we had agreed that it was not something that was going to be possible for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| but it's something that we could do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| Keep in mind, and I think Commissioner Burroughs' point was a very good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| there's really a three-step process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| The first step is does commission want the flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| You may not want the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| And Richard Walls will not always be the Knox County auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| And so there may come a day where there is someone in that role who you don't feel good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Well, your options are very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| And so this just gives commission and gives the audit committee more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| That's step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Step two is if we have that flexibility, I would imagine we'll probably do an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| but we haven't explicitly voted on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And so we do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| That's step two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Step three would be to evaluate the RFP and the vendors who've proposed onto that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| vis-à-vis the function we have in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| So it's a three-step process, and we're only in the first stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| Now, if the commission votes to allow the function to be either in-house or outsourced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| it may be too late to bundle all three this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| But keep in mind, the external auditor is limited to a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| Now, four years may seem like a long time now, but it's not a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| So four years will come around before we know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| And at that point, it probably will be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Some of you will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| There will be other members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| The audit committee will have changed, but you'll have enabled the next commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| and the next audit committee to have the ability to bundle all three audits together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| with the potential of better pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Right now we don't have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| I guess I'm reading the room in that we would like to at least proceed with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| So, Mr. Jarrett, could you prepare an ordinance for us at this month's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| So, thank you, Mr. Carsello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And we will have that on the agenda for July for first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| The next item on the agenda is the discussion of the Knox County Solid Waste Audit Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Mr. VanDeVeet, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Oh, would you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| I'd like to begin the discussion, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| I don't really see that there was a lot in here that we did not know before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| with the exception of, I guess, a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| And that's why I'm going to ask a couple of questions and open it up to any other commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| The first thing is I saw in the report that in February of 2004| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| that there was a settlement reached with a company for $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| Can you or someone shed some light on what that was all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| Because that was before I was on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| but the fact that we had a settlement with a company for that amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| could someone kind of shed a light on what that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Mr. Chairman, my knowledge of that is limited to what I have read in the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| and previously seen in the Pam Reeves report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Unfortunately, that was on the tenure of my predecessor and Mr. Salter's predecessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Mr. Walls may be able to shed some light on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| but there's not actually anybody who's currently engaged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| or employed at Solid Waste who would have any firsthand knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| This was so long ago that most of the staff has changed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| Mr. Walls, do you have any insight on that as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| I'm just interested in why there was this agreement or why there was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Actually, we've got about a 15-minute presentation, and that's one of the items that's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| But simply what happened there was it was a previous contractor that ran the green waste facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1927)|
| 0:32:16| that the relationship ended badly and sued Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| and that was a settlement of that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| So we don't know the specifics of what was going on there as to why there was a lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| Actually, from reading transcripts, it was real similar problems that occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| that led to the second mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| So it was real similar issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Dwight, one other question, and maybe this is something for finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| We were talking about duplicate invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| I noticed that in all of the items that were in the audit report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| management has concurred and there has been specific steps taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| to make sure that these types of things don't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| The duplicate invoices, I'm wondering, maybe you can't answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| but how did that happen and what has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| to make sure that we're not paying duplicate invoices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Because according to the audit report, some things were, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| forced through the system, and I guess I'm just wondering about all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| Mr. Chairman, again, that's actually a finance question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| In terms of preparing the responses to the audit, the solid waste staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| and I prepared all the responses to those portions that deal with the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| of the facility and the handling of the materials on site and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| The portions that related to financial reporting, like the grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and the duplicate invoices and those sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| that response was all prepared by finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| So I'd have to defer to Mr. Troyer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| Yeah, I'd like to say one thing that's in the audit response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| for the people who haven't seen it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| There were over 11,000 invoices during this time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| that added up to over a million dollars' worth of invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| And these bills were processed through three different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and we used three different accounting systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| And so when we have that much activity and that many different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| with their hands in it, then it can happen and actually did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| Accounts payable takes its direction from the differing departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| and in this case, the solid waste invoices, invoices from NRRT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| came from the solid waste department, from the parks department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| from the schools department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| And if there were any corrections to that, we did have software limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| which required if we had to void and re-enter in all of that activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| then we had to have a variation of the invoice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and that was something that was on purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| and something that had to be done in order to make a correct payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So that has been taken care of now in terms of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| if we had duplicate invoices here, there may be duplicate invoices in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| And it's a signal and I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Mistakes can happen, there's no question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| and we can't say that there will be no mistakes ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| But I feel comfortable about the controls in place that are adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| and I feel like that we have certainly simplified the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| to minimize the chance of error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Mr. Walls, did you say you had a presentation for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| It will take about 15 minutes and then we'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Commissioners, do you want to hear the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| This is going to bore you to tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| But in 1968, the average sound byte was 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Today, the average sound byte is 7 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| The reason for that is people's attention spans are very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| I say that to you because you say you have a 15-minute presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| If you can edit, I think that that would be to everybody's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| I'll talk faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| Okay, first I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Hold on just a second. Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| I'm just wondering, is your presentation, is it anything new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| or is it pretty much just what's in the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Because we've all read the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Whatever you all wish, but it will clarify some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| and probably answer questions that other people might want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I know that many of us have read the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| and we've had an opportunity to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| So I was just hoping maybe there would be some new stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Nobody has asked me any questions except for Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| I'd like to, I think that this, I think you need to give this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| and I would encourage you, just like Chairman Hammond has suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| to make it short, hit the key points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| This doesn't need to be swept under the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| This is pretty outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| I may even summarize some of this again just to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| just so everyone knows what happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| because this should never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| And I do, you know, I do want you to go ahead and make your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Hit the key points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Do it quick so no one forgets it because this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| All I ask is you tell us what page you're on because you've got several pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| So let us know what pages that you're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| And probably you can pretty much follow the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| We've got this in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| That way we can write as you're talking on what page you're talking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Just have a few brief remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| You know, thanks to everybody that provided information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| and assisted us, you know, during our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| And we actually got great cooperation from everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| And as you've already discussed, the issues, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| occurred in a prior administration, not the current administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| And some issues you were aware of, some issues you weren't aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| And I think the most important thing to note is they have already taken action on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| The notebook itself is three sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| The first is the audit report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| The other two areas we've referred to in the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I thought it was important that you have full copies of the Pam Reeves report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| and then the mediated settlement agreement the commission approved July 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2318)|
| 0:38:46| The engagement, again, was initiated through the work plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| county commission, and the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| We covered fiscal years 2003 through 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| And, of course, solid waste covers recycling, litter programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| tire program, convenience centers, yard waste facility, and household hazardous waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2340)|
| 0:39:09| The important thing to note that this is a special revenue fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| And a special revenue fund is used to account for the proceeds of specific revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| that are legally restricted to expenditures for a specific purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| And if you look at the Knox County CAFR, the financial report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| the fund is used to account for all of solid waste and recycling activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| Our objectives was to look at receipts and disbursements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| to see that they were adequately documented, approved in accordance with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| compliant with policies, procedures, compliant with contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| compliant with laws and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| If you look at page 5 of the report, we give you a brief summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| of the financial statements of the solid waste fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| And if you look at fiscal year 2010, we had about a million dollars in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| about four million in expenses, and you can see we were short three million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| If you look at page 6 of the report, we actually take those four million dollars of expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| and break them down between the different programs within the solid waste fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| And if you notice the convenience centers, that's the lion's share of the expenses, 67%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| And if you look at the other programs, they're actually all less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2442)|
| 0:40:53| Getting into the findings and recommendations, which start on page 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2453)|
| 0:41:03| in order to help an organization obtain its goals and objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| you should have a system of internal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Example procedures would be approvals, authorizations, verifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| reconciliations, and segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| During our work, we noted the areas that needed improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| which would be the contracts, monitoring, the duplicate payments, compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| cash receipts, and grant reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| If you turn to page 8, we'll get into the first issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| which was the contractor agreement monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| This is just a basic management tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| It's to review and monitor your contracts and agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Especially important are the ones that have a financial impact to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| The first one we looked at was NRRT, and the first issue we identified was revenue sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| And the agreement called for revenue sharing at a rate of $1.50 per cubic yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| and as you're aware, the prior director unilaterally waived this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| However, in our opinion, he didn't have the authority to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| The next item that we reviewed with NRR was the 27,500 payment to a vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| for processing of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Knox County had already paid the $23 tipping fee per ton to NRR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| and as you're aware, the prior director approved this, and again, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| he didn't have the authority to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| The third issue we identified was the contract called for $23 tipping fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| for this to be adjusted annually for the consumer price index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| As you're aware, this didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| These first issues were actually included in the false claims lawsuit that's ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2580)|
| 0:43:09| and all three of the items were addressed in the mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| The next four contract areas that we looked at were kind of falling into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| what were you thinking category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| The main problem with them was that Knox County paid either or some of an expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| that was paid for by the other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| We should note that there would be not due any money back on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| It was just purely a poor business decision on Knox County's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Of course, you had the city of Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| There was a differential in the tipping fees that amounted to about $58,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| You had manure where, in this instance, we paid about $73,000 on behalf of the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| and the fair, and the city of Knoxville, we paid about $14,000 for their pallets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| This last one, Tennessee Valley Authority, is kind of a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| This is where a contract was entered into without any authority to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| If you look at the contract on Exhibit 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Knox County does not show up anywhere on that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| Basically, the former director entered into this agreement with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| There was also a restriction in there that the bottom ash was not to be used or converted for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| As you know, this wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| I'll just move past the recommendations and move on to duplicate payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| This is just as it sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| The Knox County paid 168 invoices twice for a total of about $11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| This shouldn't be confused with duplicate billings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| because we didn't find any evidence that we were billed more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| It was actually just paid more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| For this to happen, you have to have a duplicate submission of the invoice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| and then you actually have to have a duplicate entry with an alteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| If you look, this is kind of hard to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| but if you look you can see invoices 3949 and 4152 that were paid twice in this example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2721)|
| 0:45:33| Moving on to one of the other systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| if you can see the invoices with the dots after them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| that's where they were altered to force them into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| Another example, if you notice the one with the date that was added on to the invoice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| that enabled it to go through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Moving on, we actually had a duplicate vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| There were actually two vendors for NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| There was one called National Resources Recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| and one was National Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| We observed there were duplicate payments made through both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| Moving on through the recommendations into the compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| this is kind of a good news, bad news finding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| If you recall, the 60 or so zoo invoices that were billed and paid in one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| that was sort of a catch-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| because actually we had been receiving manure prior to the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| so this was actually just catching that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| There were numerous notices of violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| that I don't believe was communicated to management or the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| These were, as of January 11th, all the violations had been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2822)|
| 0:47:19| We also were asked to look at the cash receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| theft at the Hall's yard waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| During the period we investigated, we saw that the shortage was $13,807.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| In this, the employee pled guilty to theft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| received judicial diversion and paid $1,000 in restitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| The last item is grant reporting, which is on page 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| As you recall, the Solid Waste Fund is a special revenue fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| intended to account for all the solid waste activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| While comparing the grants in the Solid Waste Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| to the single audit report prepared by the external auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| we noticed there were some grants that were missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| So actually there was an error in the single audit report, which was corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| There were these additional items that I thought you should be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| and one Commissioner Hammond asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| We were all aware of the mediated settlement with the current contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| but I don't believe anybody knew about the mediated settlement with the former contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| As we know, the green waste facility land is being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Number four, there is an outstanding lawsuit with a neighbor of the green waste facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2924)|
| 0:48:53| One item you've already took time to start a correction was the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| where basically as it reads right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| you're not supposed to accept green waste at a convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| Is that fast enough? That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| On this last one, we are now accepting green waste at the Halls Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2955)|
| 0:49:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| And that is, we're not supposed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| According to the code, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| But you all started the process of correcting that last month with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| So I believe the second reading will be this month to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| So what are we saying in the correction, just for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| That you can't accept green waste at convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| Halls has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| This is good work, Richard. I mean, it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I'm going to summarize just for anyone out there so they understand sort of the magnitude of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and how this is really, in my opinion, is pretty outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| We were supposed to, and if I say something incorrect, please tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| but this is my interpretation of what I've read and what I've heard from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| is we were supposed to have received $311,000 on the $1.50 per cubic yard tipping fee that we got nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3015)|
| 0:50:24| Because it was waived by a mid-level manager without going back to his director, the department director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| without going back to the mayor, without going back and having any contract modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| The amount comes from the lawsuit is where the amount comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| Okay, and then we paid $58,736 to accept Oak Ridge's waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3045)|
| 0:50:55| That was the difference between the $10 per ton that Oak Ridge paid and the $23 per ton that Knox County paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| We just picked up their cost for handling their green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| They did pay, yes sir, they paid some and that was the differential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| In other words, we paid over $58,000 to accept the green waste from Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| We also took from the city of Knoxville, because their handler doesn't do pallets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| we basically paid the person that's running our facility over $14,000 to take the pallets from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3085)|
| 0:51:36| Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| And there was another, I think there was another $27,500 that was not authorized that we paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| and we paid over $73,000 to accept the manure from the zoo and the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| And none of that was really authorized by the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| It was just done between the vendor at the site and the mid-level manager without senior management knowing about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| without the mayor or supposedly the mayor and the county commission approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| without any written amendments to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| You know, I added this up and we're up, if you take this, we're right just a little bit over a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3132)|
| 0:52:23| That's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| And money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| That's what we know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| You know, of course, there may have been other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I'm sure this was a very complete audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| But just to put things in perspective, where we're looking at buying police cars for the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| where we're looking about giving potential pay raises to our law enforcement officers, this is getting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| close to paying a third or more of what a pay raise would entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| So this is some pretty significant dollars that we've lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| You don't need to make a comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| I'm just making a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| So we're at half a million is what we're owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| Mr. Chairman, I don't want to say a lot because there is still some stuff in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| And I think that's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| But thank you for what you've done here, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| You know, I'm looking at the Pam Reeves report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| We've had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| And I find that that report's pretty weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| And you're going to find some things about that in the litigation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Going back to page five, Richard, on the short file there, where we say we're off three million this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| you go back to 2003, you're just off some 700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| But then the next year, 2004, it goes up to 3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| What's the cause of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Well, actually, if you go back to the 2003, there was a different method of funding going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| If you look at the very first line, actually taxes of three million were allocated to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| So really you're talking about the same three million or so that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| Instead of transferring it from the general fund early on, they were allocated property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| So it's in the revenue side rather than the transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Well, I appreciate the way that you mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| We're basically taking taxpayers' dollars to pay that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| And I agree with what the mayor says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| If you can do it in the yellow book, if you can find it in the yellow pages, then we ought to outsource that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| Who paid for these duplicate payments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| All these duplicate payments that you keep talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Who authorized those duplicate payments to be paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| They were run through the finance department just like any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Who signed off to say pay them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| It was actually different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Sometimes you would see it coming out of the solid waste department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Sometimes you would see it coming, say, out of Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Sometimes out of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| And that's why you ended up with duplicate payments because you had, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| possibly a driver would bring back a copy of the way ticket and, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| schools would pay off of that and then solid waste would also submit an invoice for the same ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| In these cases, they were both paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Who authorized the most overpayment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| We have a list of them, but I don't have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| Do you have that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3336)|
| 0:55:51| Of the $11,000, it's my understanding that there was $9,000 credit given through the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| and that there has been a request from the company for the remaining $2,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3358)|
| 0:56:05| Back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| So we couldn't differentiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| You asked the question from which department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| From schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| He mentioned several right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| And we don't have a detailed list either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| Richard, going back to the Haas facility, some $13,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| You're showing short there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| How much did she pay back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| From the court records, I saw it was $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| She took $13,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| All she had to pay back was $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| And that's just for the period that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Well, I can tell you, litigation is going to show that there's quite a bit more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| about four times more than that that was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| So we'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| But that's something that's already been tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| We can't deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| But, you know, Mr. Chairman, I'm just amazed at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| This is something that's major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| I mean, Dr. Briggs and others, we've said, you know, we're looking at $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| And Brad Mace has come to us at times saying, you know, guys, you guys are going to be over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| And it seems that we just sort of gloss it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| We just seem to gloss it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| You know, if we had a half million dollars, wouldn't that be great to give for pay raises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| Or not laying people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Not laying people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| And, you know, a lot of people want to brush us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Like they're saying, these are tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| And when we can save money, let's save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| But there's more that I want to say, but I'm not going to say anything because litigation is still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| And when that is finished, I think we're going to see quite a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| It's not my intention to gloss over any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| This is egregious and it's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| One thing that I do have here that I actually asked Mr. VandeVate to put together for me was a green waste project timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| that shows actually when all of this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| And I'm going to try to send one around for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| One thing that I want to point out is that, well, two things actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3490)|
| 0:58:19| I don't care to speak ill of, or I prefer not to speak ill of the dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| but John Evans was director of solid waste when this happened, when all of this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| And he was supervised by Bruce Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Neither one of them are currently in those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| I think that there was a tremendous amount of waste, corruption, even fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3524)|
| 0:58:54| But again, the person who was in charge of it is not someone that we can go to and ask questions at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3534)|
| 0:59:06| I also think it's worth pointing out that there was a settlement of claims between NRRT and the county where, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3546)|
| 0:59:18| we had overpaid, but the county did not hold up its end of the contract either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| And that came before the commission in July of 2008, which was before my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| but several of you were here at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| And Sam, Tony, Mike Hammond, Rick, and Dave all voted for that settlement of claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| And then everyone who was on commission at that point voted to extend that contract with NRRT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| So I think that we can all be outraged that this was allowed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| And I am outraged that this was allowed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| And this is one of the reasons that I ran for office was because of this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| But the commission voted to settle these claims, so there's nothing that we can do at this point about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3607)|
| 1:00:19| And we have two very good people in charge right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| Tom Salter has done an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| He's come in and uncovered and dealt with a great deal of corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| As far as the green waste project goes, four employees are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| The contract is expiring, and we have chosen to let it expire, and we have chosen to sell that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3640)|
| 1:00:48| So this will not happen again because this commission is making sure that it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| I also think that our revenue, or not so much revenues, but our fees, the money that solid waste is bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3656)|
| 1:01:11| Dwight, I had a conversation with you about this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| Would you care to tell us what positive things have happened in solid waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3675)|
| 1:01:23| Because I want to make it very clear that this was very much in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| and that the people who are in charge now are not the people who were in charge when this was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| and that this commission has taken steps to make sure that this is not going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| What's happening right now is the kind of business that we want to see Knox County engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3699)|
| 1:01:48| Certainly. Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Just briefly, and this crossed my mind when Dr. Briggs mentioned the figure of half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| that potentially represents losses that the county might have suffered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| and there is no circumstance under which that can or should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| And I'm keenly aware of the fact that when commission authorizes a report of this nature and you receive it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| then the obvious question is, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| And this is an unusual set of circumstances because in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| basically everything that is reasonable and prudent and in the best interest of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| at this point you have largely already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| In particular, authorizing the sale of the property is vitally important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| because this is a chapter that we want to close and it will enable us to focus on our core mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| Solid waste is far more than Solway, but Solway has been a significant distraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| Our core mission are eight convenience centers across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| We touch 10,000 constituents a day in those convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| Solid waste through those convenience centers has direct constituent contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| with more individual Knox County citizens than any other department in Knox County government except the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| We are number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| They are big, complicated facilities to run, and we run them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| And as an example, in response to Commissioner Boyle's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| one of the things that we've seen is an increase in commingled metals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| and for the month of April, we took in $127,000 net revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| For the month of April 2011, $127,000 in net revenue from our eight convenience centers from our recyclable commodities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3809)|
| 1:03:40| And as we move beyond Solway and we concentrate on, to quote Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| staying in our lane, and our lane are the convenience centers and not the green waste facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| we think we can continue to manage that number well and continue to make it go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| and continue to run centers that you'll be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| So I would just ask that you receive this report and when the property has been auctioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| and we come back to you with a final price and a proposal for sale that we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| and close the chapter on this unfortunate story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| When did John, when did he pass away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| What year was that, 2004?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| John Evans died in December of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| You know, Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to other commissioners, when this comes out in litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| the commission is going to be surprised as to what they see and some people that are in positions now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| I'm not saying who, but some people that are in positions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| You know, we keep saying, well, the person that before passed away and that person did that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| No, I'm not throwing blame there, but some of the people that are in position now that have been in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| you're going to see that they just continue doing the same thing and we'll let litigation, you know, prove that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| And I think Mr. Mays will probably want to come and say a few words at appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| He may show up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| And if he comes, I'd like to hear what he's got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Richard, let me ask you just a budget question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| On your page five, total expenditures of the Solid Waste Department, they bounce around four million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| drop down to three, eight, early 2000, 2009, four million, 54, 2010, four million, 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3930)|
| 1:05:41| Tell me if I'm doing apples to apples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| The budget that was given us not too long ago, 2010-11 is four million, 307.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| Am I correct in saying there's a $300,000 increase from 10 to 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| That's possible because I think the, Dwight might better answer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| but probably the hauling fees or tipping fees, also called tipping fees or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3966)|
| 1:06:15| I know there's a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| Richard's report, he says the 2010, I hate to ask you something that's not in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| but it was four million, 74,000 total expenditures by Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3986)|
| 1:06:34| But 2010-11, what's applied to us by the mayor, four million, 307.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| I mean, would we be up $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| We potentially might as we improve convenience centers and as fuel prices go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| Our costs for tipping and hauling both go up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| I don't have the budget in front of me, Commissioner, so I can't be as specific as I'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| But certainly it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| One other thing that I should mention, and I know what Richard meant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| but I would want the commission to know this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| We do account for revenues and expenditures in the Solid Waste Special Revenue Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| but we are not self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| And with the operation that we presently have of eight convenience centers across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| I don't think we can ever be self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Just like other departments of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| we will need some general fund appropriation in order to continue the level of service that we provide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| What is your tipping fee for just household garbage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| $23 a ton, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Same for green waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| Or is it less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| It should be a little less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Oh, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Has it gone up, Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Tom really is the expert on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| And as Commissioner Boyle said, has done yeoman's work, came into a very, very troubled department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| and has worked hard under some very difficult circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| And he's chapter and verse a card-carrying expert in these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| So I would be well served to let him speak directly to these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Mr. Shouse, my name is Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| I live at 1000 Sky Blue Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| You had just questions about the tipping fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| Just the household waste tipping fee versus green waste tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| The green waste tipping fee is a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| It's $24, $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| The two tipping fees that comprise the bulk of our expense is the construction demolition waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4103)|
| 1:08:33| which is $17 a ton plus a haul fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| and the garbage box, or the MSW tip fee, which is around $24 plus a haul fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4116)|
| 1:08:44| So every time we empty a box, it's over $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| And we empty 300 or 400 boxes a month, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| It's more than 3,000 boxes a year that go out of our centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| Construction waste is $7 a ton more than green waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| It's less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| $7 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| It's $17 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Because it goes into a different landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| Yeah, and it would—I mean, green waste is decomposed relatively quick compared to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| And green waste is just out of our pocket, out of the county's pocket, is just a few thousand a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| It may be $2,000, $3,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| There may have been more when we had the tornadoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| But the impact on our out-of-pocket, especially since we got rid of the Oak Ridge payments when I came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4164)|
| 1:09:34| it's like $2,000 or $3,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| And the garbage is $1.6 to $2 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| So that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| And that fluctuation does have to do with just the weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| I mean, if we get a 1% or 2% difference in weight in the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| that could easily account for a $300,000 or $400,000 change in the garbage hauling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| Do you still accept pallets and the counties on the hook to dispose of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Because I know there's—the guy in Malawio here rebuilds them and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Is that just for a very small fraction that are rebuilt and recycled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| We will take broken pallets and our demolition boxes at the centers for no cost to citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| But the green waste facility, I believe, charges whatever their weight amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| But we don't pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| We actually—we obviously—what a citizen brings to a center and that we accept at our centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| we do pay for that disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| But that's going to be put in the demolition landfill because it's going to go into our demolition waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| A pallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| A pallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| So that would go in at the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| At the $17 a ton rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| And it's going to be a broken pallet typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Because an intact pallet is rebuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| We would encourage citizens to take those to a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Although once you're at—once a citizen is at a center, we are trying to do a good service for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| And if they don't really want to go anywhere else, we will work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| I don't want to get into a sparring match with Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| But I do want to say that as far as the lawsuits go, that the county has extricated itself from any of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4279)|
| 1:11:27| because I believe it was the—what I read was that it was found to be without merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| So—and if someone comes down and says something—and I'll just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4295)|
| 1:11:45| just because Brad Mays comes down and says something for me does not mean that it's so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| So I will be interested to see how all this works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| But in reference to the lawsuits, I do want to make sure that it's on the record that Knox County is not part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| because it was found to be without merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| Yeah, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Knox County is not part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Mayor, can you come to this real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| Tim, while you're coming, a lot of this stuff—number one, we know you're very familiar with the mulch business and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| and appreciate what you did during your term of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| A lot of this happened—or I guess 99% of it happened before it was even your term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| or all of it's happened before your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| My question to you is, Mayor, if this—once we're through with litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| and some group of peoples or Knox County employees are found guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| what's Knox County going to do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Have you thought about that far in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Well, Tim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, 6401 Airtree Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| The courts are going to take care of that, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| That will be their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| And then we'll deal with the aftermath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| I'd probably have to yield to legal on what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| But that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| We're going to wait on the courts and let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Joe, any comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Mr. Chair, members of the commission, in a nutshell—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| I would like to say it's premature for me to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| We don't want to speculate on this and we don't want to get into a situation where we're starting to slander people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| Bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| If an employee is ultimately convicted of wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| then under your progressive discipline policy the mayor has options in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| depending upon the severity of the offense, again, if convicted of wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| can then do everything from outright termination to progressive discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| That's what I'm—you know, if somebody is found just out and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| they did something that they shouldn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| you know, just what the administration had planned to do, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| Well, that's their duty for any employee, regardless of where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| If someone is convicted of criminal wrongdoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| then any entity, my office included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| would be hard-pressed not to take action under the personnel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| I think that we've spent a lot of time on this and that we're ready to move on, but Commissioner Burwell—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| Well, I would just like to make certain that everyone understands that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| no one has been indicted or charged with a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| So when we're talking about if an employee has been found guilty of wrongdoing in a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| we're talking about someone who has been indicted and charged with a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| and that certainly has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| And I don't expect it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| But, again, if it did, anywhere in any department in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| it would be dealt with accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I have no doubt of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Mr. King, did you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| If I may, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I did sign up, and I'm here not so much on the basis of this audit report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| as the basis that I think it was something the media had reported previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| about double billing in connection with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| I represent the vendor, NRR, and I'm John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4512)|
| 1:15:21| And I wanted to make sure, and I think this body does, in fact, understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| that there was not any double billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| What we had has been described as double payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| and that was a double payment that occurred on the basis of what happened at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| NRR was not a part of any duplicate billing or double billing or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| As already been mentioned, there were over 11,000 invoices, over $1 million involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| and when we got down to the end of it, what had occurred was to the extent that NRR had already discovered duplicate payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4553)|
| 1:16:02| they had credited other bills to the county for that amount, and when it was all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| we sent the county checks for the difference, and it was a little over $2,400, and we sent the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4570)|
| 1:16:20| By then, Mr. Woyles had this audit going on, and I think properly said, no, we're not taking any checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| We're going to complete the audit, and at the end of the audit, we'll see what, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| you may owe other than what you've already credited to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| At the end of that, they invited us in, and we sat down with them, went over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| All said and done, there were roughly $2,400 in checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| They said, you're right, that's what you owe us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| We'll now take the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| The $311,000 number, you say that comes from the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| It comes from one side of the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| There has been no hearing that involved disputing parties on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| I think the county at one time analyzed the amount involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| And I don't mean to minimize it, but it's just a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| You said $311,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| I think the county's number was somewhere in the range of about $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| Not that the difference makes it okay to have done what occurred, but it's just that that's a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| The $58,000 that represents the difference between what Oak Ridge paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| and what Oak Ridge got was the result of an intergovernmental contract between Knox County and Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| Our contract says whatever they bring us in the form of green waste or material from other intergovernmental contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| we're supposed to take it and we're supposed to be paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| We didn't have anything to do with getting or any involvement in the contract with Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| The same is true with the city pallets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I think the manure issue may have been even a matter that originated under our predecessor contractor, not under NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4674)|
| 1:18:04| I wanted to make those comments because I think the statements made in some of the media was inaccurate, at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4684)|
| 1:18:15| in what occurred and I wanted to dispel any idea as to some of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| And Mr. Smith is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| There's a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| There are disputed issues in that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| They'll get all worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| That has nothing to do with what has happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Do we need to formally accept this report, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| Oh, well, when he comes back we'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Let's move on to the discussion of the Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| What I would like to do on this, ladies and gentlemen, is to see if any commissioner has any amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| that they would like to make to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| We're not taking any formal thing from any department head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| We've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| But the purpose here is to see if any commissioner has any amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| or anything they would like to do to change the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Or if you want to hear from somebody again, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| I'll begin by saying that I have met with Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| He is in agreement that we, and I'm going to recommend that we reinstate the commission discretionary fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| of $3,000 per commissioner with this caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| The caveat being that all of the discretionary items would be brought to commission for approval on its agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| so that that would eliminate the need for putting these things in the newspaper and paying all of those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| The second thing is that when a commissioner gives to commission an item from the discretionary fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| that there is an item there showing exactly what it's to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| and the organization it's to be used for so that we don't get into the situation of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| well, it's being used for political purposes, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| The other thing is that we would post on our commission website all of the discretionary items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| and the amounts going to each so it's fully transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| So in my meetings with the mayor, he doesn't have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| And so just to let you know that I will be presenting that as an amendment to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| Other than that, does anybody else have any amendments that they want to offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| Anything that they want to bring forward at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Commissioner Broyles and then I'll get to Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| I mean, Sam, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| I don't aim and I sort of resemble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4828)|
| 1:20:37| The mustache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| But before I guess I continue in terms of what your amendment is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| I'd like to understand the process because I guess my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| I guess you arrived at that dollar amount based off of last year's amount per commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| there was an additional, I guess, $500 that came when we had dual seats there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| And then the year prior, so it went really from $3,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| The year prior it was $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| So is that up for discussion at Tuesday's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| I'm just trying to understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Are we just throwing things, we're putting things on the agenda to discuss further at Tuesday's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| Or is now the time to discuss them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| I mean, this is a meeting to discuss and, you know, we can do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| But I'd call this meeting to see if you had any questions of anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| if there were any final questions that were scheduled to meet next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| I just want to throw that out that I had had those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| The mayor is in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| If commission is in agreement, and I will be offering that as an amendment on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| We can't do it today, but I just want to let you know that I do intend to offer that as an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| just for you to be thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| So that was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| In terms of an amendment to this year's budget, I'd like to offer, and we can discuss where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| I do think a hotel-motel fund is the proper place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| But I'd like to offer as an amendment that we change the dollar amount given to the Beck Culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| and Enrichment Center from $12,000 to $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| Now you had mentioned the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| Yeah, we can discuss the logistics of that now, later, or however you want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| We have Gloria Ray here, and so I'm sure she's prepared to talk about hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| She got this look on her face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| That's okay, Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| You don't have to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| She may not be prepared yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| I wanted to, if it's okay with Sam, to interrupt here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| This is just purely a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| If we're going to start to add a number of amendments, can we either vote on those today, defer those today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4977)|
| 1:23:07| or if we do have a series of amendments, give us the list when we're there next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| Because let's say there's probably 1,000 items on the budget right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| I can't remember what they all are and what the dollar amount is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| But let's say we add another 50 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| Is that when it comes time to vote on these, we won't be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| at least I won't be able to remember if we don't see these someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| If we're going to vote on each one of these as amendments, we'll have to get a list to vote on them, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| Yes, this is why our clerk folks are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| And so what we'll do today is just make a wish list today, and then we'll vote on it next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| Right, and we want to get a fiscal note on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| because if indeed there are changes like Commissioner McKenzie's, I mean, we have to have a fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Well, there's a fiscal note on what you proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Exactly, and so where is the money coming from, and how is it going to be paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| So that's why we're giving ourselves time to do this rather than next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| Then all of a sudden, I mean, of course you can amend any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| but that's why I wanted us to get together today to see if there were any amendments that anyone wanted to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| Right, so the process will be is we'll just make a list today, and then we'll vote on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| We'll receive the list and be able to vote on those amendments individually next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Yeah, I kind of want to talk about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| The first thing I want to talk about is the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| We spoke last year for about an hour or so during budget meetings about the Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| and I haven't discussed it with Dr. McIntyre, and there is an impact on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| But when I first came on the commission, that was one of the things that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| the great schools becoming self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| And since then I've spoken to Mr. Thomas about the $2.6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| spoken to the mayor about the $2.6 million that we're sending to the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| That Great Schools Partnership is that $2.6 million we give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| and Buzz says he adds money on top of that to fund TAP program at two or three Title I schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5107)|
| 1:25:17| I've inquired briefly, not as in-depth as I'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| but some of those teachers that get TAP money can get up to a $4,500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| Not to say that all of them do, not to say that that's the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| Now, if you're making $45,000 and you get a $4,500 bonus, that's a 10% pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| Although it's one time, it's a 10% pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| The teachers every year, most teachers get a step increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| if they're not tapped out or topped out in their pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| And so they're looking at a 3% pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| If the state gives them anything, they get a 1.6 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| So you're looking at, you know, 4.5% pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| And then some teachers are eligible for TAP money, some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| And we're telling the rest of the government employees you're not getting anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| And so if you get a $4,500 bonus and your salary is anywhere close to $45,000, you're getting a 10% hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5170)|
| 1:26:18| plus what the state gives you, plus what the step increase gives you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| And we're telling the people that are equally important to the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| some can argue one way or the other, we're sending them home with nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| I got an email from, got several emails, but one that really put the numbers in my mind was one deputy sent me an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5196)|
| 1:26:45| and said his check is $240 less this year than it has been in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| That's real money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I mean, that's not, you know, cost of living and everything figured in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| Everything is more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| So I'm going to discuss with Dr. McIntyre and Bob Thomas about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| and the only reason I'm thinking about this is because last year they told us they were going to lay off 17 people during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5227)|
| 1:27:14| And after we approved their budget with those 17 layoffs, they kept those 17 and hired five more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| And so they found the money they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| And 2.6 is not a lot of money in the school budget or our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| but that 2.6 would fund a 2% pay raise for county employees, general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| And I want to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| I think it's something that we need to consider and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| Another thing that I would like to discuss is travel pay for Knox County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5257)|
| 1:27:47| Now, this has been vilified as something that's costing the county a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5267)|
| 1:27:56| Now, there's going to be times that that, you know, the way I look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| and Dr. Briggs has made the statement it doesn't matter to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| and Larry has made the statement it doesn't matter to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Well, they're successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| They make a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| That doesn't matter to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| But if you looked at last year's ballots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| you're going to see that there wasn't a whole lot of people lined up to take these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| And so I'm not saying, as a physical part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| I think it's better to have a $300 a month, a general number, instead of a guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| Because there may be, you know, there's going to be agenda items that cause us to travel a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| There's going to be zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I mean, there's all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| And to have a set number that's steady every month is a lot easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| than having four people touch another piece of paperwork in the county to do an expense check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| Now, I think it's, you know, is it going to make a difference in my life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| Probably not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| But I'm not the only commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| And I'm not, you know, Dr. and I hate to go to them too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| but they've both said they don't care about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| And it's a matter of cash flow to me as far as for the county's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5348)|
| 1:29:15| $300 a month is a steady number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| It may go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| It may go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| But, you know, let's just call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| The travel money was put in place back when the county court was formed and had three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| It's a supplement to your salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| It's taxed like your salary, similar to your salary, not exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| And so instead of bumping salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| they always bump the travel increase to make it politically more advantageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| And to me, if you want to do anything, roll that money into the salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| cut any travel pay that's inside the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| and only reimburse commissioners for travel outside to Nashville or to a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| Because call it what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| It's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| It comes on your W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| It's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| And if you want to just roll it into your salary, steady number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| and don't give any expenses for inside the county travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| Let the commissioners, if they want to keep their mileage right off the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| if they don't, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| But I think, I mean, it's been vilified, and I don't appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| And I think it was unnecessary to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| And I think a steady number is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| And so those are two things I'd like for you guys to think about and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I guess what I have is not so much in the way of amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| but sort of foundational questions as to the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| So I don't know whether this is the right time to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| Would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| And I guess this is for Mr. Troyer primarily at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| When I'm looking, when I'm trying to get into particular details in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| there's a couple of problems that I run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I mean, I run into a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| But one is things that as we run through the columns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| it's obvious that we've changed accounting systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| And so I guess I have some basic questions about that change, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| So could you tell us about first just why did we change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5500)|
| 1:31:47| And just a little bit historically, make the bridge between what we had and what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Yeah, we just changed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Why did we change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| The county had a contract, had purchased a software system through Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| The cost to renew the annual maintenance for Lawson was expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| There was no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| It was an expensive system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| It was expensive to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| When the county received those annual prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| we got to a point where we said we've got to put this out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| And as a matter of fact, for the bid price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| we got a totally new system for less than what it would cost just to maintain the Lawson system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| And with that, then we have decreased our annual costs of a financial system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| that's going to go along with that every year since the annual maintenance is a percentage of the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| Comparable to an annual maintenance at the old system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| And so this wasn't anything we chose to do other than we felt like we were put into a corner with the old provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| And this made financial sense to move to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| And yes, it does change the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| I apologize if it's not as clear as you would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| And I hope that our people are helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| And we're glad to work through anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| And they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| And of course, I call on your staff, and they've been very helpful to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| How long did we have Lawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I think it was five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| What did we have before Lawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Penemation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| And that we had in, I think, 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| And all the records with Lawson, of course, are going to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| We can come back and go back into that and look wherever we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| We can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Now, the main thing, the main problem that I have with the presentation as it is, is it's very difficult to compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5623)|
| 1:33:51| Like I would think five years would be a normal round time frame to go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| But on these pages, we've got 2010 with a row of zeros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| And so for me, I'm like, what am I comparing to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| I can't go backwards if I've got zeros in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| And the actual 211, I'm not even sure when the cutoff date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I mean, when that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| And by the way, when is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| Is March of 2011 the cutoff for the actual 211 column?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| I think it was even earlier than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I think it was December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| So those are questions that I just have difficulty with in terms of trying to, you know, make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5672)|
| 1:34:42| I just don't, I can't say, well, if I'm projecting what the budget needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| I just don't have any reliable data to compare back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| And so I don't know how to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| And I don't know what to do now since the budget is presented this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| A couple of things that could help, and we'd be glad to work with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| If you wanted to look at a longer time frame, I think one, two, three, four, five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| we've got on just the summary, the summary page on the proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| we've got five years' worth, and that's at more of a fund level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| But I think that can be an indicator and a starting point to some of your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| Now, another piece to that is we do have the hard books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| This is the annual report, but it's a book that looks much like that budget book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| And I think that's another helpful method is to take the hard copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| and we'd certainly be glad to collect that information for you for the ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| We made a fiscal decision at the time that the county implemented MUNIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| which was just last year, not to go back and import all of the historical numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5754)|
| 1:36:05| from the old systems, from the Penemation, from the Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| because there was some change in our chart of accounts or some change in our object codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| and there wasn't necessarily a one-to-one match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| And so it would have been a very expensive proposition to be able to have a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| to do just what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| And I think the way to get to what you'd like to do is that we can certainly work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| and say, okay, here's a MUNIS report and here's three Lawson reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| or four Lawson reports or five Lawson reports that would go with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| that would be comparable, and we're happy to do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| I've got a few other questions later, but these are probably more directed to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I just wanted to, what Dr. Briggs was talking about, how we're going to be making these amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| and having them written down so that we can refer to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| there's probably going to be amendments made, or in fact, I know there will be amendments made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| at the actual meeting next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| So I would like to ask that anyone who is bringing in an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| to please type it up and have copies to distribute to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| so that we have something black and white that we can refer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| And I wanted to tell Brad how much I appreciated what he had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5848)|
| 1:37:38| about travel allowance for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| Either way, either rolling it in to the salary and not reimbursing anything in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| or doing it the way we've been doing it is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| I am opposed to trying to do a mileage system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| because I think it does create unnecessary paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| and more work that somebody else is going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| I also just wanted to talk about raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| My understanding is that there are, I think, and I don't know this 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| but my understanding is that in some of the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| those employees are being given raises this year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| So I don't see how we cannot give our general county employees a raise this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5901)|
| 1:38:31| And that's going to be at the top of my list when I come in next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| And I did some, I wanted to thank the members of finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| who came and met this morning for breakfast and answered some of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| And I have been saying very publicly that I support a 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| But after a conversation this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| I'm open to the idea of a step increase in lieu of a percentage type raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5934)|
| 1:39:04| just because it might make more sense for the county this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| So I'm looking forward to talking to Francis about that before next Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| to see which makes the most sense for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| But in terms of our general budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| and how we handle this over the next week and next Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| this budget represents choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| These are choices that we make for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| And we base those choices on our values, what we think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5976)|
| 1:39:45| And I think that we have seen that in a lot of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| and debate that we've had around this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| And I think all of that has been very good and it's been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| So I think that I have some concerns about the school budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| that we have raised our standards for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| but we lack the money to buy the textbooks to teach to those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| That's a problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| So I look forward to more conversation and more debate over the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| And I think that up until this point, what's happened has been helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| and it's been useful for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| And I appreciate everyone who's taken the time to meet with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| and let me know what their priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| And I look forward to the next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| and seeing how we translate our values into the choices that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| for our county moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| And I'm trying my best to dig into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| And maybe this is a question for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| And it's in regard to the road outlets limited drive extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6070)|
| 1:41:22| What are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| It sounds like we're going in debt for part of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| and we're spending operating money for part of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| I think we need to get Dwight up here to talk about the operating piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| But there is a piece that is in the capital plan, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| That's the $2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| There's some effort there, I know, from his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| But I'm not sure about the operating commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| And he's behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| Commissioner McKenzie, I'm not aware of any operating dollars that are in the outlets limited drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| One of the things that I think got confused in some of the earlier budget discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| was that there had been an increase in the account from which we do road resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| That is construction heavy maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| That is an operational account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| And it would be entirely unrelated to the outlets limited drive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| That should be CIP funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Jim Snowden is the project manager on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| If I'm mistaken, I'm sure he'll come down and clarify it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| But I think that may be the origin of the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| Well, I know you handed me a piece of paper that said we spent about $87,000 to this point on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Well, we had really two separate pieces to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| We had a realignment of the intersection of outlets limited drive and Lovell Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| and some lane improvements and signalization improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| That was a separate piece that was going to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| regardless of whether or not the full extension of outlets limited drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| and the realignment all the way to Campbell Station Road was to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| So that particular portion of the project was a given for FY11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| It was the further project taking it all the way on out to Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| and the joint project there on that end at Campbell Station and Everett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| that will be in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| I'm not sure if that helps anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| I guess I'm trying to understand, you know, and I'd ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| so the document you provided me with last week, whenever it was we met last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| was the alignment and the extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6219)|
| 1:43:46| I think that the total project budget, and that was a figure of around $2.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| was an inclusive figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| That includes the portion that's already underway at the intersection on the Lovell Road end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| as well as the much larger portion, and that's the multimillion-dollar portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| that takes the road all the way on out to Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| Okay, so all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Because I understood you want the total project budget from Lovell Road to Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| and those are the figures that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Shifting gears a little, so this project ranks where in terms of need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6258)|
| 1:44:27| That I probably ought to ask Jim to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| I don't know from a priority standpoint if it had a numeric list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| or if it was anywhere on a numeric list that's been contemplated by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| It has been in our long-range plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Where it falls specifically, I really couldn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Yeah, Jim Snowden, 1633 McCammon Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| We had had ongoing conversations about the Outlet Drive extension with the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| and it was in their long-range plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| So, yeah, there is discussions of it being a priority project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| It's not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| I don't mean to pester, but that's not really an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| You know, as we've seen through these budgets, if we're going to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| and it has to be in my estimation a priority, you know, until things turn around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6321)|
| 1:45:29| until we come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| I guess, you know, this is a large sum of money that we're spending on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6331)|
| 1:45:38| in these tight times when we're cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| So I guess I'm trying to understand that I really need an answer for why build this road right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6341)|
| 1:45:50| and who does it benefit right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| A couple things, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| I think if you're asking us for sort of a numeric ranking, I'm just not sure we can offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| We have the long-range plan, as Jim alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| The City of Knoxville has a long-range plan, and the Town of Farragut has a long-range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| And where we have intersections with those other jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| we try to keep these projects in alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| But in terms of picking out a particular project and saying that's number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| I don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| And, of course, those priorities change as administrations change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| In this particular case, the north side is largely undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6384)|
| 1:46:31| but the south side of the interstate, the Parkside Drive corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| has obviously been phenomenally successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| Our interest was in part driven by the interest the Town of Farragut has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| because there were problems with the intersection on their end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| particularly with needing to realign Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| Actually, not Everett, but Atlas Limited Drive at Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| So when the subject came up, it seemed like a viable project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| and our instructions were to move it up the list, and that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| Well, that's a bit troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| Of course, I agree that long-range plans are just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| but you transition from a long-range plan to what's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| And so I guess I'm not hearing the process that got us to wanting to spend $2.8 million right now on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6437)|
| 1:47:28| So, you know, and maybe this is a question for Todd Napier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| but this seems to be a developer in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| Isn't a TIF more appropriate for this type of funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| It's going to seem like a project that's going to develop a landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| has, you know, he's placed some value on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| and isn't that a better way to fund this type of project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| I would have to defer as far as the TIF to somebody at the Development Corporation Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| but I would say, and I think I probably didn't do an adequate job in our last discussion of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| and maybe Jim can speak to this more eloquently than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| but there is transportation value in the work that's being done in terms of improving the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6487)|
| 1:48:15| and in terms of connecting to some surfaces that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| There have been some road improvements that are already there that are simply gated off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| and there is transportation value to that realignment that exists independently of whatever sort of economic development value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6504)|
| 1:48:31| or economic development impact that the project might be expected to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| And I don't know that I've ever done as good a job as I need to in articulating that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And you know, and you're making my point beautifully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| The last two TIF projects we had come through was exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| The town of Farragut, rightfully so, needed access on Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6528)|
| 1:48:53| This was going to be a great way for them to get into Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Similarly, off of the slip ramp off of Pellissippi, I mean it was a TIF, but this was for general benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6537)|
| 1:49:05| And I think this commission has already said that that's where our dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| that's where our TIF dollars are going for something that's more so for the public good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and not necessarily for a developer who has a plot of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| So, you know, Todd, I won't ask you to get up today, but if you wouldn't mind, you and Dwight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| if you all could, you know, help me understand why this isn't a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| And thank you for your patience, Mr. Chair, because what I'm probably leaning toward asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6571)|
| 1:49:39| unless I get some data and please feed me information, is let's not do this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| These are significant funds that a couple of commissioners talked, we're spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| we spent like drunken sailors for these libraries and senior citizen centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Let's not continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Let's pay off some debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Let's not add another $2 million onto our debt and debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| Let's see about, you know, clamping down, especially on a project that seems fuzzy at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6606)|
| 1:50:14| It became a priority, it was on a long-range plan with a bunch of other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| And again, what my charge to you is to bring me information that says contrary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| that this isn't, you know, kind of just a project that was out there that just got quickly accelerated to number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| So if you could do that by next Tuesday, I'd greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| Sam, can I ask a question on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| Is this a bonded or is it fully paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| No, I think this is probably capital dollars, so it's probably bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| I'll be glad, Commissioner McKenzie, I'll confer with Todd on the sort of the economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| and potential development of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| But if Commission would indulge us and let Jim speak just briefly to the transportation value of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| he's far better qualified to do so and he offers a far more articulate explanation than I do of why this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| has been percolating around and it has been percolating around on a transportation basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| and not exclusively on an economic development basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| And again, I guess I'll say, and I'll turn my light off, so is the slip ramp off of Pellissippi at North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6671)|
| 1:51:18| That is an extremely important corridor that's going to relieve some traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| So is the wide road extension, which, you know, so you kind of understand where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| If you could say this is greater value, so our public dollars, we need to spend those as opposed to spending them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| Slip ramp on Pellissippi, I'd understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| But, you know, if you could put a value on it based on what other TIFs have done here recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| I'd like to understand that a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| Is John still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| Just a couple of quick, before John gets here, Sam, is this the, the letter we got when I walked in here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6717)|
| 1:52:05| five to five, at first I thought that was a game changer, but it says we ask that the MOU of 2004 be honored and reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| But that's really just asking for status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| I mean, we all got a letter from Beck as we came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| This doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| This doesn't change your request or anything, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| Well, it doesn't change my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| I don't speak for Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| I read this the same time you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Okay, I just read it in between breaks and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| I think it's just asking for status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| Johnny, on the commission budget, Jolie and Drusilla, they're lumped in with the commissioner's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6755)|
| 1:52:44| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I'm looking at this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| They are, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| $653,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| I did the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| It was $59,000 a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| I said, wow, you know, where is it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| But now I see it's the staff up there and their copy machines and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| While the drop was $75,000, is that for requested $587,000 to propose 512?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| Is that the beer inspector thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| That's a piece of it, yes, and a piece of it is the discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Well, no, the discretionary was a separate unit code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| Yeah, it's a separate line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| The travel would have been a piece of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| So your proposal is 512,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| Does that have any travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Actually, the $300 a month is removed from the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| and then there is an allowance, and I don't have that right in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| but there is an allowance for some estimate of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| with the expectation they would turn in some mileage, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| I think it's about half that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| I think the number turned out to be in the low 40s and about half that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| So Chris is telling me $20,000 for mileage reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| As opposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| $45,000 or $3,600 times 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| What is officials' expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Do you know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Usually the primary thing that that is used for is for the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| to send for the NACO dues, the National Association of Counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6857)|
| 1:54:23| and to have one commissioner go to the annual conference of NACO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| and there's some other national memberships that they're a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| I just saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| It goes from $30,000 to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| Commissioner Ollenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| I usually don't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| I just want to, for one, today's my anniversary, so I'm going to scoot out early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| because my wife, I'm going to steal something from Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I may have to go by Kimball's if I don't get home soon and take her to dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6892)|
| 1:54:58| But I think that this budget, and I'm not going to offer any amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| because I think it's physically sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| It's probably the most physically sound one we've had since 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| Looking back on the past ones, is there some more cuts that I feel we could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Do I feel that the county employees deserve a raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| If we can find the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| That's what it all boils down to is where can we find the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| As far as the travel allowance, I fill out a T&E for my personal job right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6924)|
| 1:55:32| so filling out a T&E is not that big of a deal for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| If it will save the county money, then I'm all for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| No, I'm not wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| The discretionary fund and the travel expense, if it went away, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| If it stays, it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| So that's all I really have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Ed, one of those may have been, was it Patsy Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| Was that salary taken out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| I think U.K.'s was in there, but I didn't think Ms. Miller's was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| Hers was not in the commission budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| Mr. Chairman, with these amendments, and, you know, I agree with what Jeff has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| With these amendments, I mean, we can keep throwing amendments and let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| I mean, it's like a Christmas wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| We need to have some sort of cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| Because I'm thinking Mr. Troyer is going to need to know how much we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| If we need something, a Thursday cutoff or a Friday at 12 o'clock cutoff and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| I want, as a commissioner, I want to add this, and here's what it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| And we need to let the administration say, you know, tell us what the figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| total up the total figure and give that back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| And then we need to hear if we do all this wish list, what's the outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| What's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| We hear that people are going to be laid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| I'm like Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| Yes, I'd love to give everybody a 25% pay raise if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| I'm in business every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I call on businesses every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I called on a business yesterday, Mr. Edwards out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| that is one of your top, top people with the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| They haven't given a pay raise in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| And they've cut their people $50 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| I mean, yeah, we can give pay raises, but what is the actual public out here doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| A lot of people in public, they haven't seen raises in eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| So, you know, we've got what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| I don't want to be making amendments and added things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| but I think, Mr. Chairman, if we're going to do that, I mean, we'll be here all day Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| because they'll come Tuesday and say, okay, well, now I want to add this and I want to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| You know, here's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| If that's your feeling, you know, you should have run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| You should have run for mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| The mayor has come up with a budget, and this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| But every one of us sit here and let's add four or five things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| You know, why didn't we run for mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| I just think that we need to have some sort of cutoff, Mr. Chairman, some way that we would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| So we'll have time to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| You know, Friday if it comes up that now this is $620,000 or it's $2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| We need to know so we can be thinking about it rather than make a split decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| Okay, this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| And we need to hear reaction from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| So what's that going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| I don't know, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| I don't know if you'd appreciate having that up front or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| That's me thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| If I was in your position, I'd want to know, guys, if you add another $7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| here's what this administration is going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Jim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| You're correct, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| Bring us an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| Mr. Chairman, I don't know how it's been done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| but I think it would probably be good protocol if we had some sort of time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| or area where amendments, ideas, or suggestions would be brought so staff could prepare the official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7146)|
| 1:59:15| I'd hate for them to have to do that on the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| And this year being as tight as it is, in my opinion, I think that would compound the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| So I would suggest some sort of time frame that you could suggest the commission would agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7163)|
| 1:59:30| This is actually, I look back, I believe six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| I believe it's longer than has been given, I think, since at least 2000 to go over a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7174)|
| 1:59:43| So we've had plenty of time, I think, for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| We've had hearings, and it's been great public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| So I would make that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| I'm wondering if we, and I agree, that was one of the reasons why we had gotten together today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| was to see if there were any questions or to offer any amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| And so could we say Thursday at noon, is that enough time, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| If we said Thursday at 12 o'clock, let's try to, this doesn't mean anybody can't if they want to on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| but I think it's the responsible thing to get it out there so we can see how it's going to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| Any amendment that comes up has to be funded somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| It's got to either come from the general fund, we're going to have to take it from somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| or we're going to have to put in a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| So, I mean, those are the only options that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| Let me get Commissioner Wright and then I'll get the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| I only want to speak to something that Commissioner Ornby had just addressed a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| First, I'd like to thank the sheriff for the sandwich, so if I can just get my throat clear now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7243)|
| 2:00:53| The discretionary funding and the travel as commissioners, there's the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7253)|
| 2:01:01| Thank you for the sandwich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| Over the last three years, because the travel allowance for commissioners comes in the form of the W-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| comes in the form of regular pay, I felt like I was supposed to itemize it back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| because that's the way it ought to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7289)|
| 2:01:34| Two of the three years, I have traveled more than the allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| And if we're going to say we're going to do away with traveling at all, well, I guess I would do away with traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| That doesn't seem right, unless the citizens of Knox County think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7305)|
| 2:01:53| I probably shouldn't travel or maybe I ought not to be paid for traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7313)|
| 2:02:00| From Corrington to here, it's a 33-mile round trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| We're doing something every Monday this month here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| I believe that's a part of being in this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| But if I go to Gap Creek or I go to Hills or I go to, there are a lot of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| and I'm only traveling in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| There are two other commissioners that are traveling countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| So if we're doing away with travel, if we're estimating that the travel expense is going to be cut in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7349)|
| 2:02:36| are we also estimating that the travel should be cut in half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| I don't think that goes hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| The expense still occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| I think it should be covered one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| I believe that's as Jeff said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| If we want to keep up with mileage and get it paid ever how, once a month, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7373)|
| 2:03:04| If you want to convert it and make it a part of the wage, that's okay also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| As you retire, though, you'll find that W-2 wages impact your Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| There are lots of ways of looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| I think it's an expense and it needs to be covered, whether it's done by the mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| or whether it's done with a monthly check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| I was just following up on what Commissioner Ornby had said something about a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| The other thing that I wanted to make a comment to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| because I'm only commenting right at the moment about those things that actually affect commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| is the discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I know it's been proposed that we take care of it here in the open meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| but as I've thought as it was considered over the last several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| there is only one appropriate way, delineated by state, that has to be advertised in a newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| which is quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| I think we're spending the equivalent of one commissioner's discretionary fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| in advertising all of the other commissioners' discretionary expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7456)|
| 2:04:23| So in order for me to accept that we can do it here in the big room and be okay with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7463)|
| 2:04:31| I think that the law director is going to have to tell us that that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7471)|
| 2:04:41| The same as Ornby, whether we have it, $3,000, or whether we have it not, that's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7481)|
| 2:04:52| I can't think of anything else right off that deals directly just with commission with our expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7492)|
| 2:04:58| but I'll reserve the right to speak about these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| The reason that I have brought up about the discretionary and the reason I met with the mayor about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| is that these are funds that can really impact the community in a small way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7507)|
| 2:05:14| We're talking about $100, $50, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| I remember, for example, when the Gibbs softball team were going to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| and we were asked if we would help fund their trip to the state for the softball tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| I was happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| I thought that was a good use of monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| I don't think most people would object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| I took a check for $100 to Mount Olive Elementary School the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| They didn't know I was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| I thought the principal was going to hug me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| One of their wands had broken for their magic boards, and those wands are $76 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| They didn't have the money to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| She was very appreciative of the fact that now they could get a wand for the magic board for that classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| I took another check for $100 to New Hopewell School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| Same reaction from the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| Some of their bulbs had gone out on those active boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| They didn't have the money to buy those bulbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Now they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| Each of you have instances where you can talk about things that have met needs in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7569)|
| 2:06:15| that these people just didn't have the funds for, but yet we were able to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| These are tax dollars that are going back into the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| They're going back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| In talking with the mayor about this, he had agreed to go ahead with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7584)|
| 2:06:30| that it would be fully disclosed, fully transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| The city does this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| I was at the city council meeting the other night talking about Hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| and the first item on their agenda were their 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| It was right there, and they have $10,000 per council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| It was in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| They voted on it, and there it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| In looking and talking with people, if it is put on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| and if it is out there for people to see, and if it is listed as to what the money is used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| and if it is voted on on open meeting, I'm told that that's acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| that we don't have to come in and notice because it's already noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| and it's already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| We need to make sure that we're totally doing the right thing with regards to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| but I'm told that that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| I think that's been one of the drawbacks of the system that we've been operating under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| because if you're writing a bunch of $25 checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| and every one of them has to be advertised in the newspaper, that's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| You could write your $3,000 out in one notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| and the advertising expense is a lot smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| That's where I was getting at on that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| I'm still trying to get this procedural question settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| From what I gather is that we'll set a deadline at noon on Thursday for any amendments to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7670)|
| 2:07:57| and I guess there will be a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| Is that what has to be in there for what the amendment will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| I think that's the responsible thing to do is if any commissioner that wants to offer an amendment that they bring forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7685)|
| 2:08:10| I'm not picking on Sam, but Sam said I'd like to have $150,000 for the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| or Amy says I want whatever it is, $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| I'm picking a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| I don't know what it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| $3 million for a 2%, 3% pick your number for a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| I'm not meaning to pick on them, but they'll have to put a number down that we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| What I don't want to do is just vote on a blank check not knowing what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| So that will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| And then if we do have that there, should there be a proposal as to where that money comes from, or is this just a blank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7715)|
| 2:08:43| I mean, again, not picking on Sam or Amy, but if Sam says or Amy says I want $3 million, I propose we put 50 more layoffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7723)|
| 2:08:54| or I propose a 3 cent tax increase or I propose taking it from the, you know, from the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7734)|
| 2:09:04| So there will really be several, three parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| One is what the amendment is, the dollar amount, and where it comes from so when we're voting we know what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7747)|
| 2:09:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| That's how I would envision it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| I would not bring an amendment to the budget asking to spend money without also telling you exactly where the money is coming from to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7758)|
| 2:09:26| I think that would be irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| So, yes, I'm not going to come in and say with the wish list I want all of this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| and throw it in the lap of finance and ask them to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| That's, I don't think any of us would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| That was just my procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| And that's, you know, as far as having everything in by noon on Thursday, you know, again, I'm not asking them to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7785)|
| 2:09:58| I'm not asking the administration to, you know, to come in and say, well, if you do this it's going to result in this many layoffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7798)|
| 2:10:06| or we're going to have to close the whole department and lay off 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7806)|
| 2:10:10| because I will come in with a plan for where the money is coming from and how it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7810)|
| 2:10:17| So I am opposed to a deadline on Thursday because I think that we are intelligent enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7817)|
| 2:10:27| and that we can come in Tuesday and evaluate what we need to do with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7827)|
| 2:10:34| And in terms of this year's budget and years past, you know, the last two years that I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7834)|
| 2:10:42| we've passed some very fiscally responsible budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| I object to them being characterized any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7846)|
| 2:10:54| I think that and, you know, last year I know we passed the budget early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| because there were very few changes that any of us needed to make last year or the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| And that doesn't seem to be the case this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| So I don't think it's quite appropriate to compare this year to the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7870)|
| 2:11:17| in terms of what we need to do with the budget and how long we need and what it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7877)|
| 2:11:25| And I especially object to anyone characterizing that we've been outspending like drunken sailors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7885)|
| 2:11:32| or however you want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| The last two years we passed very fiscally responsible and conservative budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| and we're going to do so again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| I have no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Well, let's say that we have a request that by Thursday we have the information in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| And obviously, I mean, any commissioner can make any proposal on Tuesday that they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| So Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| I'm going to give you all a highlight of what I'm going to write up and I will have it by Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| I do appreciate what Commissioner Briggs had laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| and I do concur with the fact that we need to say where the money is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| So if you have your pens ready, what I'd like to do is, and again I will write this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| $138,000 for BEC, $75,000 to restore the senior rider program at K-Trans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7939)|
| 2:12:29| I'm going to ask to restore back to what basically cut what we had in 2010 in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7949)|
| 2:12:43| divide by two the discretionary funds that we had per district by two down to $6,000 per commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7963)|
| 2:12:52| That's $66,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| And the difference in travel per commission, I'm saying it's $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7975)|
| 2:13:03| You all can, the difference between the head, I think John Troy said at 20, okay, that's right, $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7983)|
| 2:13:11| We're going to bring a total of $294,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| Where I'm talking about taking that money from, we, if we had a flat budget to the engineering and public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| flat budget, we had an extremely rough winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| We didn't have the mega snows, but we had more snows this past winter than we ever had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| and we complimented public works on how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| We total line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| That is, their budget was increased by $364,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| That leaves us an additional $70,000 per my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| So that's where I'm talking about pulling the money from and I have a net gain to the county of $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| But I will write that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| I would like to, this is probably, I'd like to pull some items, a few line items from the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| just as I guess an example of some issue that I would have philosophically with some of the things that are taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8044)|
| 2:14:17| and some of the mayor's themes in terms of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| So I guess I'd like for the mayor to come and just, I'm just pulling a few as examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8061)|
| 2:14:30| and just have a few questions as relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8070)|
| 2:14:41| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| And I've got the books here in front of me and of course you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8084)|
| 2:14:51| One item that I'm looking at right now is on page 59| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| and it has to do with an area that you're very familiar with being from the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| and our legislative delegation on that page has, they've been budgeted $72,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8102)|
| 2:15:13| or the projected budget is $72,223.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| And it looks like there's a complete cut, 100% cut to that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8118)|
| 2:15:29| And I'm just wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| It seems like it would be in our best interest to certainly keep up with the legislative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8133)|
| 2:15:43| via the legislative delegation, everything that affects the county, state and federally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| And we, that's what we've always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| And so that's an example of a 100% cut and I'm just wondering about the rationale for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8152)|
| 2:16:05| Tim Burchett, Knox County Mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| I don't know, Commissioner Norman, if you have this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| It's a letter from Representative Ryan Haynes, I believe is the chairman of the Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| He says, and I'll just read it if that's okay, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| I'm not sure of the protocol here, but I'll just read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| It says, Dear Mayor Burchett, after consultation with your office and County Commissioner Mike Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| the Knox County Legislative Delegation is requesting that the duties of the Knox County Legislative Affairs Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| be transferred to the Knox County Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| It is our intent that no resources should be allocated to fund this change in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| If you have any further questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| Best regards, Ryan Haynes, Knox County Legislative Delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| So basically he said he's just transferred it to commission and is saying, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8212)|
| 2:17:01| that if the commission wants it, then they'll have to fund it through your office, the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8221)|
| 2:17:11| Okay, so now it's up to us to keep up with federal and state regs that affect the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8231)|
| 2:17:19| and our office is supposed to handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Well, we don't think there will be any additional costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| We think that Joe Lee can probably handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| And as far as federal, that has nothing to do with federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| I think that's not carried under that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| If I might chime in on this, Commissioner, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| In talking to Mr. Haynes and in looking at the operation of that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| the volume of phone calls that go in there, quite frankly, are not substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8262)|
| 2:17:48| Some of the calls that would go in would be reverted to us anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| They're talking about different things that are going on in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| So if it had been a large number or a huge volume of calls, then yes, it would be something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| But we're really not talking about that significant a change in terms of just the number of calls that we would get in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8281)|
| 2:18:08| Now, if we do, we can always address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| But it's just in my conversations with them, they didn't think that would be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| because they're not getting that volume of calls now, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| And two, with the Internet and folks having instant access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| and I sit on the Senate floor and get e-mails from constituents, the access is direct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| There really is not a go-between, so to speak, that you would see maybe back when this was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| I believe this was actually formed when I think former Mayor Ash, I believe he was a representative, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8313)|
| 2:18:42| when this happened and that was way before computers, rotary dial phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| and they would actually have a meeting every Saturday morning when they came home from the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| while the legislature was in session, I believe, in this very room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| And that's when constituents could come address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| Of course, everything's changed since then, the information highway and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| Okay, that's an item that could dramatically affect us, and this is the first that I know of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8343)|
| 2:19:13| So it's, I don't know, that's a place for us to go and discuss further, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8353)|
| 2:19:21| One other item, while I've got you, obviously we have notable differences in terms of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8361)|
| 2:19:27| So when I looked at the budget, there is in your budget a page in reference to planning under the general fund section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8367)|
| 2:19:39| And I'm wondering, and you may need some help with this one too from John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| but in the category other agency, last year we had budgeted $746,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8384)|
| 2:19:55| It's been cut to $646,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| Can you tell me what page you're on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| Okay, I'm on page 171.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| And I'm wondering, I have two questions in relation to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| One, of course, again, I mean, it's, I consider the county as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8407)|
| 2:20:18| in a course of economically relatively depressed period right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| but we're going to have extreme developmental pressures in the future because we have a wonderful place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| So for planning dollars to be removed from the budget is something that's relatively onerous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8429)|
| 2:20:39| And so I'm wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| First of all, is what part of that budget affects MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8441)|
| 2:20:50| I'm wondering also what the city contributes comparatively to the planning budget in comparison to what we contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8450)|
| 2:21:02| And I don't, you know, I'm just concerned about planning especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| Well, if you're asking if we cut them, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| And that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| I do not know what the city, I can't address what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| Was that the total MPC budget, $746,000, and you cut them to $646,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| I believe that, no, that's just our contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| So that's a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| Amy, I agree with what you're talking about when you're going to talk about your amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| and how you want to fund it and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| My question, and that's a good idea, we need to, so we can make educated vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| You're going to, we're going to send this in by Thursday and you're going to tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| all the commissioners are going to tell how they want to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| That's what you're thinking, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| No, I'm going to tell you how I want to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| Anything that I want to do, not just things that I want to fund, but maybe things that I think need to be cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8521)|
| 2:22:10| But, no, I'm not guaranteeing that I'm going to have them in by noon on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| I'm going to do my best to get them to you as soon as possible, but it might be Tuesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| Well, and that's fine, because that can be quite a bit to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| John Tory, if people send this in, will you have time to give us rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8542)|
| 2:22:28| or are you going to say, hey, this is a good idea, bad idea, or will you just wait until Tuesday to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8548)|
| 2:22:36| Well, depending on how long the list is, what we have to work with today, the list is not that long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8556)|
| 2:22:41| and we would certainly be glad to compile that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| We'd be glad to make a recommendation and ultimately, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8563)|
| 2:22:46| this legislative body is the one that adopts the budget, but we would certainly compile that for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8566)|
| 2:22:52| and present that for you and certainly add our comments to every single item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| And here's where I'm getting at with this, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| If we have quite a bit, you might want to move the meeting up a little bit for next week, if we have quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8580)|
| 2:23:07| I don't think we will, but we may have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| I know we've made accommodations for other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| I have an outside board meeting that's out of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| It takes me an hour and a half just to get there, so I will need to leave by 430 of next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| so I'd like to be able to vote before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| So if you feel that we may have to have more time to discuss these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| we might want to move the meeting up at your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| Or if you need to leave by 430, that gives us a deadline and we have to vote by 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| 427.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| 427.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Yeah, this is, I'm all stuck on rules and regulations and procedures here, just so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| Now, when we meet next Tuesday, then we will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| I mean, actually take a vote on the amendments that are being added to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Will we vote on a budget that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| We can vote on the budget that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| And the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| It doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| And the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| I mean, it would be up to, I mean, commission could delay it if they want to, but the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| We theoretically could delay it until the full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| You could, but, you know, again, this is why we're having the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| That's why we're having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| I wanted to say, John, that I appreciate that, but, you know, my feeling from everything I've gotten from the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8665)|
| 2:24:32| and from the administration is that they're not open to a whole lot of compromise on any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| I'm not expecting you to take anything that we suggest and come back and say, yes, this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| My feeling is that probably what we're going to be told is why we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| So, you know, I appreciate your willingness to tell us what it all means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8691)|
| 2:24:59| but I have to tell you I'm a little skeptical that we're going to hear anything other than why we shouldn't do what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| that we want to do as the legislative body who's in charge of finalizing the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8707)|
| 2:25:15| And I'm not meaning that as a criticism at all, but that's why I'm hesitant to, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8715)|
| 2:25:28| let's throw it all out there and you can, you know, tell us what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| I just want to be really upfront about what my impressions have been so far when we've asked for the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8734)|
| 2:25:42| to consider, you know, other options or compromises or whatever, we've been told categorically no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8742)|
| 2:25:50| So that's why I'm feeling a little hesitant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| And, again, that's no criticism on the finance department, John, or on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| I just want to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| What we have so far is restoring some of the commission's discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8763)|
| 2:26:11| The Great Schools Partnership will be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| The $2.6 million, reinstituting some of the travel pay for the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8773)|
| 2:26:20| an increase in the Beck Cultural Center to $150,000, salary increases for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8780)|
| 2:26:27| also reinstating $75,000 for the CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8787)|
| 2:26:32| And was there anything else that has been brought up today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| I think it's important that we look at where we've defunded Iams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| who takes care of managing Mead Quarry at no cost to the county for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| I think we also need to look at Legacy Parks, who's taken $50,000 every year for the last six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8807)|
| 2:26:53| and parlayed that into a $2.5 million gain for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| We need to look at restoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| I'm very concerned about what we're doing with our seniors, with the CAT buses, which Sam had already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8820)|
| 2:27:10| I'm concerned that we are cutting jobs from people, that we're going to give the Hope Resource Center $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8830)|
| 2:27:22| I think we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| Anyone who is losing a job, who's not found a spot elsewhere in the county, I think we need to take a second look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8846)|
| 2:27:38| And those are some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| I think we also need to look at the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| We need to look at what Sam brought up about how we're funding our road construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8864)|
| 2:27:55| Those are all likely to be topics of conversation moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8875)|
| 2:28:02| Procedurally, and Mr. Assistant Law Director, correct me if I'm wrong, when we meet on Tuesday, we will be discussing the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8882)|
| 2:28:12| We will be voting on the amendments individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| At that point, we will vote on a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| We have to vote on the budget in total. It cannot be piecemealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| After we have approved the budget, then we will approve a tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8901)|
| 2:28:27| And will we be approving any of the capital at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| John, will you have on the budget or on the agenda any capital at that time or is it just the tax rate and the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8911)|
| 2:28:38| There's three proposed resolutions, the operating budget, the tax rate and the five-year capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8918)|
| 2:28:46| Right, so those are the things we'll be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Now, it will take six votes to approve the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| No, it's simple. Majority enters at two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| Okay, we'll double check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| Just so we know the exact vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| But should there be, well, we don't need to talk about that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| If possible, if we do get information in by the deadline on Tuesday, could this be sent out to us by e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| Because we're going to have citizens asking about this and, you know, trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8957)|
| 2:29:21| And Sam did a very nice job breaking this down, but people are going to ask me about these different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| And, you know, it's hard to remember all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| Can we put it on the forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| If everybody has the stuff that they want to send in as an amendment, just go ahead and post it on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| so it's available to the public and to all of the commissioners at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| Make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| I think it's appropriate that Troyer gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| I think it would be more than appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| Also, Jolie, can you, you've taken notes of what we talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| Jolie will send out a memo first thing in the morning, too, just to kind of, and that way we'll have that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| And another question that I was asked today, you know, by a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| and I'm not implying anything one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| and this may be something that we, if we know right now that's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| I know the mayor has the right to veto ordinances and resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| Does the budget fall into that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9010)|
| 2:30:11| Yes, the mayor can veto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9011)|
| 2:30:12| He can veto a line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| And just for everyone's information out there, what does it take to override a veto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9013)|
| 2:30:18| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| Which is seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9019)|
| 2:30:20| Seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| We do have some folks who have signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| but we need to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| I'm thinking that any of you folks who are here with the government, we're done with you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| But those of you who want to speak at public forum, we are very interested in what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| But we're going to take a ten-minute break, and then we'll be back and we will have our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| We have five people who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| The government employees are not allowed to do a somersault on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9047)|
| 2:30:58| We have five people who have signed up for our public forum, and each of you will be given five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| And I will be having a rather heavy gavel this evening to keep you on time and on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9064)|
| 2:31:10| Our first person, Arnold Cohen, if you would come to the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| My name is Arnold Cohen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| I live at 3912 Maloney Road in Commissioner Brown's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| I work in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| I used to work downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| I'm one of the vice presidents at the Beck Center, and I'm here in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9090)|
| 2:31:37| And the Beck Center would like the Beck Center is grateful for the amendment that Commissioner McKenzie is proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9097)|
| 2:31:47| and we certainly support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| On a long-term basis and a bigger picture basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| the Beck Center would like Knox County to honor the memorandum of understanding of 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9113)|
| 2:32:04| Now, I know there's been a lot of publicity to the effect that that's been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| We disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| I've given you a letter prepared by the Beck Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| and that sets forth in more detail why we think that has not been terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9136)|
| 2:32:25| and why we think it's still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| That MOU of 2004 was not a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| It's a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| It was a contract that was directed and approved by Knox County Commission at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| Knox County Commission never authorized termination of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9165)|
| 2:32:53| I don't know the legal effect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| The county law director will probably comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| I'm not expressing a legal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| I'm expressing a state of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| We think also at that time or over the course of years following that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| and I think it was an enlightened thing that Knox County entered into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| It was a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| But things changed in Knox County over those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| and Knox County violated the MOU by taking Beck out of the library system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9199)|
| 2:33:29| as the MOU required it to be in the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| It took away funding that had been promised and has reduced it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| and we're grateful for what we get, but we think we really should be getting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| And then I've commented on that notice of termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| There's been publicity to the effect that Beck violated the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| Beck never violated the MOU, and I've set forth in detail, or in some detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9236)|
| 2:34:03| we can go into more documentation on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| that Beck tried very hard to turn over its property to Knox County in accordance with the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9246)|
| 2:34:14| and we were stonewalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| It didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| But that wasn't for lack of our trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9261)|
| 2:34:24| and when we were frustrated at getting the county law director's office to prepare the county documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9264)|
| 2:34:33| which is the normal way to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| we engaged legal counsel on our own to prepare a document, a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| and presented it to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| We've never had any comment from Knox County on that lease draft to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9284)|
| 2:34:55| Knox County made a very large investment in the Beck Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| It was basically a public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| The Beck Center put up land and archives, and Knox County put up money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9304)|
| 2:35:11| It was a good idea for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| On a long-term basis, we would like the commission to look toward reinstating that MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9314)|
| 2:35:23| as it was contemplated in there, perhaps working with us if it needs to be tweaked or changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| We're certainly open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| But we should go back to that on a long-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| It's not going to happen in this budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| But it could happen in the next budget year, and we would like that to be considered seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9340)|
| 2:35:49| We really question whether it's fiscally responsible for Knox County to write this investment down to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| If you do nothing, at least we may get our operational funds up to $150,000 reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9356)|
| 2:36:06| Maybe, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| So that wouldn't be exactly walking away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| But to walk away from this funding is a write-down of a very large investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9371)|
| 2:36:18| It's writing it down almost, I guess, to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| And we would like for you to look at it from that point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| because it hasn't been looked at from that point of view previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| We've taken a real pasting in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| That was unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| I know from talking to Mr. Rice that the mayor's office did not have the advantage of the materials that had been generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9396)|
| 2:36:49| and that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| I think we were naive on the part of the Beck Center in that we didn't appreciate that they wouldn't have that, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9411)|
| 2:36:59| And I guess everybody, we feel kind of blindsided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| I think the mayor's office probably feels a little blindsided by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| But that's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| But I think we can overcome it in future months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| I think we all have the best interests of Knox County at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| So that's what we ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| We'd like to see Commissioner McKenzie's proposal passed as part of this next budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| and we would like to work further with Knox County to try to get Beck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| and Knox County working back together again to preserve this archive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| and to preserve this community center for the benefit of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9464)|
| 2:37:45| Mr. Briggs, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| Mr. Coleman, before you sit down, thank you very much for sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| You know, we've heard a lot of things that people said they had heard something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| and I appreciate you coming down here because I think you have the real knowledge as to what all has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| What is, over the years, could you make an estimate about what Knox County's total investment is in the Beck Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9480)|
| 2:38:07| Well, our president, Mr. Ware, is sitting here and he's got a much better grasp of the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9487)|
| 2:38:12| I hope he's got a better grasp than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| I am really not sure what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| I know there have been some, I guess you'd call them capital expenses put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9497)|
| 2:38:22| And, you know, you don't really necessarily have to put in all the operational expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| because we have a pretty good idea what those are over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9506)|
| 2:38:30| In other words, what was in the previous budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| I think the commitment was in the neighborhood of, don't hold me to a figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| but in the neighborhood of about $2 million plus or minus, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| some of that money was pulled back from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| We think, by the way, Commissioner Hammond had suggested an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9527)|
| 2:38:52| You'll see in the letter we gave you that we would like an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| We think we'll wind up getting some more money as a result of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| Have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| And we're happy to be transparent with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| We have to be transparent with any granting or funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9549)|
| 2:39:14| So that's just part of our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| Did I do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| Mr. Shouse, did you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| One quick question for Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| Thank you for your comments and for your willingness to go through an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| On page three, the top line says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| consider a public comment about Beck's endowment fund of approximately one-half million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| We were sent a document about two weeks ago that didn't elude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| It stated $743,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| So it was about a quarter of a million dollars difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| That document you received was in the form 990 that was filed as of the end of our fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9584)|
| 2:39:53| What is our fiscal year, June or July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| June 30, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| And the publicity that we've gotten has caused everybody to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| and we realize there was an error in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| And the accountants have prepared a draft to amend that return, which will be done in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9608)|
| 2:40:14| I'm sure I was furnished with a copy today, but I haven't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9614)|
| 2:40:19| So I can't comment on the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| Your number is closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| It's a number as of a point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| And that number may change one way up or down as a result of this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| We do know that at the moment we have a fund of about half a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9632)|
| 2:40:38| which we've been able to accumulate from numerous gifts that is intended to be an endowment fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9638)|
| 2:40:46| that we want to use that to leverage and build an endowment fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9646)|
| 2:40:53| with the long-range view of weaning ourselves off of public support if we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9653)|
| 2:41:01| It's an enormous thing to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| But that's our starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| We have talked to the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| They've expressed some interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| And that's the kind of thing where we would proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| But your number here of a half million is more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| May I press and add something to your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| I'm James Ware, President of the Bank Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| I live at 1750 Sayles Way in Knox County, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9688)|
| 2:41:38| I want to just give you a little clarification on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9698)|
| 2:41:45| The 700,000 plus included operational funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9705)|
| 2:41:56| It was the total amount of cash that the bank had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9716)|
| 2:42:09| It was the 400 and something thousand, close to 500,000 as you have stated, plus our operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9729)|
| 2:42:19| Now, the amended form that Mr. Cohen referred to, that number will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9739)|
| 2:42:27| That number will remain constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| There was no, you know, there's been a lot of innuendo and speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| Oh, they were hiding funds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| But I think when you, when the new 990 is presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9759)|
| 2:42:48| you will see that the number that the bottom line number of 700 plus thousand was an accurate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9768)|
| 2:42:58| We simply did not include the operating funds that had been provided for that fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9778)|
| 2:43:08| They were included in the aggregate number, in the total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9788)|
| 2:43:14| but they were not included in a separate line as they should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9794)|
| 2:43:20| And this was just, I think, due to probably some miscommunication between our staff and what we submitted to our CPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9800)|
| 2:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| So the actual endowment is more like what is in line with Mr. Cohen's letter of half a million dollars and not $743,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9812)|
| 2:43:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| I have also sort of sat here during our break and tried to glance over the letter that Commissioner Shoust is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9825)|
| 2:43:57| The memorandum of understanding is probably going to be the first hurdle that we're going to have to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9837)|
| 2:44:05| It's an issue that predates this current administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9845)|
| 2:44:12| and this is going to be a question that the law director is going to have to answer for us commission-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| Is there an agreement between Knox County and the Beck Center today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9859)|
| 2:44:27| If there's no agreement, we can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9867)|
| 2:44:36| A previous meeting, the administration says it's been canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9876)|
| 2:44:42| There's no longer an effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| Current administration seems to follow that same track, and yet the Beck is appearing before us saying the MOU is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9884)|
| 2:44:54| So somewhere in here we're going to have to get to wherever the legal footing is that's between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9894)|
| 2:45:04| Go ahead, Dr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| I was going to add, and you may have to research this, but maybe you could explain to us also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| if you have a signed contract that does have a lot of legal weight, but also maybe if you can't do it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9911)|
| 2:45:18| tell us what legal weight does a memorandum of understanding have, you know, also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Michael Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| I'm the Chief Deputy Law Director with the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| I can tell you that a memorandum of understanding and a contract are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9932)|
| 2:45:38| A contract has specific commitments and undertakings which have certain legally binding effect that a memorandum of understanding does not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9938)|
| 2:45:48| I would defer to Mr. Jarrett as far as giving any further explanation as to this particular agreement or memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9948)|
| 2:45:58| Is everything else, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Then continuing on, the last paragraph in the first page is speaking to a lease agreement as modeled after the Halls Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9960)|
| 2:46:14| I'm not familiar with how the Halls Community Center lease may be modeled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| and then this is going to be not a question of the BEC, but it's going to be a question for further discussion, Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9980)|
| 2:46:30| The relationship between Knox County and the Halls Community Center, how that would model, how BEC would model after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=9990)|
| 2:46:42| You may need to be prepared to help me understand how all of these things work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10002)|
| 2:46:49| whenever I'm kind of under an understanding that all of these places are like completely county operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10009)|
| 2:47:02| May I clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| Our lawyer at that time obtained copies of documents, agreements or leases that had come out of the Knox County Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10026)|
| 2:47:17| for the purpose of trying to do a lease on behalf of BEC to the county that would be in sync with the kind of language that the county was typically using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10037)|
| 2:47:31| That's why we refer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| We were trying to do it in the county style because we didn't get that document from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10053)|
| 2:47:41| get a direct draft of a lease from the county for the BEC, so we tried to create our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10061)|
| 2:47:46| and we tried to model it after typical county language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10066)|
| 2:47:50| Okay, and then my understanding of some of those typical county arrangements are they're operated as though county owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10070)|
| 2:47:59| whether leased for a dollar a year or whether owned by the county, the county's in control of the way those centers operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10079)|
| 2:48:09| They staff them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10089)|
| 2:48:10| They pay the overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| They take care of everything that goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| And that would have been true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| That's what the Memorandum of Understanding contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| Okay, and that's what I need to understand, that that's what you all may be looking for going forward then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10102)|
| 2:48:32| That's what we had before, and we would like to do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| Okay, but going forward it would then be as though county owned, county operated, a county facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10117)|
| 2:48:45| like the other community centers or senior citizen centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| Yes, but in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10129)|
| 2:48:55| The law director has just pointed out to us that those are two different, we're getting into a question of semantics now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10135)|
| 2:49:02| Memorandum of Understandings and contracts are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10142)|
| 2:49:06| Well, I heard him say that, but if you read this Memorandum of Understanding, that's a title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| If you read the language of the Memorandum of Understanding, you'll understand it to be a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| Okay, Mr. Law Director, please take a note there for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| because I'm having trouble then understanding the variation of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10163)|
| 2:49:31| If I may?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| Please understand that I don't have the benefit of the Memorandum of Understanding in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| I do not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| Now, if we need to furnish copies of that to the commission or the law department, we'll be happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| Just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110606budget?start=10185)|
