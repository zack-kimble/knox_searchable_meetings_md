| 0:01:09| Thank you all so very much for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| We have our Tour de Cure, which is coming up on June 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| It's going to be at the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| We have five routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| It's a day full of festivities, and we like to provide our riders when they come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| from the ride with a beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| And so we get a keg of beer donated to us, and we like to provide that to give them one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| — the limit, they can only have two, but we give them up to two beers when they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| back from the ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| The event this year is sponsored by Pilot and Weigel, and — I'm sorry — by Pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| and Regal, and we have several other corporations that are out there that are helping us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| it — Teledyne, O-R-A-U-O-R-N-L, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| It's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| I would encourage all of you to come out and ride with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| I've been talking to a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| George, I know, is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| Right, George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Does anybody have any questions about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Okay, before we continue, we need your full name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| It's Wendy Mullins, and my work address is 211 Center Park Drive, Suite 3010, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=130)|

| 0:02:22| Vice Mayor Pavlis, are you going to ride in this event, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| She was trying to recruit me for that, so it would be a good way to get me back outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| on the bike, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=149)|

| 0:02:31| Some of the others of us may be spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| I was wondering if I could sit in the sidecar on George Wallace and get the beer at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=157)|

| 0:03:13| The next case on the agenda is the Black Horse Pub and Brewery, and they have asked to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| They're not quite ready, although I did notice that they have some of their brewing equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| They're not brewing yet, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| So —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=206)|

| 0:03:41| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| If you will pass these around so they get back to Mrs. Steyer, that would be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| The next case is El Cazador, and this would be Ms. Reza or Ms. Lopez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=229)|
| 0:03:59| Yes, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Did they have — they had one for — for the off — on the brewing, for the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| side of it, and then they had one for the premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| This just says El Cazador Mexican Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=256)|

| 0:04:20| Black Horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Oh, the Black Horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Do we have to deal with the third — we postpone publishing both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Are we postponing both of them, or — Ms. Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=268)|

| 0:04:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=283)|

| 0:05:39| I keep nothing to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| I'm on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| You have your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Do you want to talk about this, or do you want to keep it to yourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I keep nothing to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Anybody, everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| There was a need, actually, for young jazz musicians to have a place where they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| go and, you know, get better artistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| And also professional jazz musicians don't often have an opportunity to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and just jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| It's jamming that improves them artistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| And so we have a black box theater at the Emporium Center, which the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| is our landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| And we have turned the black box into a jazz jam venue for First Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=380)|
| 0:06:30| And we hope to be able to compensate the musicians by generating some earned income through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| So we have approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| You're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| And First Friday is May 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=404)|

| 0:07:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Before I ask for a motion, this is for the Big Kahuna Wing Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| And I see that we have some people on the beer board who are very interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| So do you want to promote it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| This is our first annual Big Kahuna Wing Festival, which will be at the World's Fair Park June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| It'll be on the lawn, and it is an opportunity for us to raise money for the Ronald McDonald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| House and the Empty Stocking Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| It will be a contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| People are actually cooking their wings there, so they'll be there, and we'll be serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| beer, selling beer to help raise the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| And we do have a lot of sponsors, Food City, BKW, The New Sentinel, WBLT, WIVC, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| And it'll also be a kid-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| There'll be a lot of live music, and also have the opportunity for a kid zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Okay, and that's June 22nd, if I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| But, Councilman Grebe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| While she was explaining, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| Why is it called Experience Arts in Memphis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| That is the 501c3, the non-profit that the event is actually held under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| Doesn't have anything to do with the city of Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=497)|

| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=666)|

| 0:11:08| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=671)|

| 0:11:13| Los Patrones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Need the name and address of the applicant, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=674)|
| 0:11:25| My name is Jamie Abeita, 3101 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| And is this your interpreter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Wendy Cornea, 3101 Sutherland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| And what is your relationship to Ms. Abeita?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Just a friend interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| The applicant listed on the application, question number eight, she answered no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| The question was, have you ever had a beer permit revoked, suspended, or denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| A previous beer application was denied on March 19th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Sergeant, I mean, Mrs. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| We need the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| So this applicant was before us last month, and the application was denied, and she is back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| I'll refresh my memory where we were a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Well, she was selling beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| She had purchased the establishment from someone else and was selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| did not have a license, and additionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| someone who was working there was cited for selling to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| So, once again, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| I was wondering, is there anything the applicant wants to report about what happened since that last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| What have you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Have you taken any steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| Do you want me to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| If she can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Someone needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| We got together and we did a remedial plan, and if the permit is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| we will follow the steps on that remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| And the steps on there, it's no ID, no sale to the underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| We're going to check IDs on everyone that enters the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| The second, we're going to have a training program for our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| and Ms. Heather Sutton, she agreed to give us a DVD toolkit to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| And then the third one is to display signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| She also provided some signage in Spanish, since the bar is mostly for Latin people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| And then we're going to be doing internal checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| just to mimic the checks that the police department does to make sure that it doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| And if it does happen, there's consequences for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| The employees will have to review the toolkit or go to a class provided by the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=853)|
| 0:14:21| And then we also have extra lighting for the back of the bar for our bartenders to check the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| And we're also going to have employee monthly meetings to let them know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Councilman Grieve, I believe you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Who filled out the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| I mean, why do we have no to question number eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| It was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| We filled it out together, and it was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Whose district is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| It's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I was going to ask Councilman Frost, since we are attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| Councilman Frost was on the vice on this, since it was denied last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=904)|
| 0:15:12| So if they have everything that they're supposed to do, where are we at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| Well, while I'm sure everyone on the beer board appreciates the explanation of what they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| to correct the problem that they were in, submitting a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| and working with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| unfortunately for purposes of this beer permit, that's not part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| The issue, as I see it, is on their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| They submitted it, notarized under oath, that certain facts were to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=942)|
| 0:15:51| And, unfortunately, they did not accurately reflect the truthful answer to number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| As part of the beer application permit and process, it is indicated once, if not more than once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=959)|
| 0:16:08| that lying is a basis for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| And so it's within the purview of the beer board if they want to deny for the misrepresentation on the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=974)|
| 0:16:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Vice Mayor Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Yeah, back to Attorney Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| So what is the disposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| I mean, they got cited before they were even opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| Perhaps Sergeant Hunter might be able to answer that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| At the time we weren't aware that the ownership had changed hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| We found out that night when the sale occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| The sale is still pending in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| The owner was not cited for operating without a beer permit because she wasn't at the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| That's a present owner or former owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| Ms. Abeyta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| What the beer board, you know, it's your all's decision whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| or not the untruthfulness on the application is a grounds for denial of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| If the beer board determines that those aren't sufficient grounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| then I would suggest, since there's a pending court matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| that the matter, the permit be deferred until the disposition of the matter in court one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| But I'm still a little bit, so did they get cited or not get cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| The bartender was cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Okay, but it didn't have anything to do with them selling before they had the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| When's the hearing date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| I don't have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| They usually subpoena us when the date's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| It usually takes about a month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| And you said that at the time of the citation for the underage sale that Ms. Abeyta wasn't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| and you could not confirm that there was or was not a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| That night I spoke to Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| She responded out to the business to translate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| She said that the sale had already been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| We explained to them that the beer permit for the previous owner was no longer valid at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| and they needed to shut down and couldn't operate until they received a new beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| We had asked before she arrived for the owner or a manager to come to the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| and she was the only one who responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| She just said she was a translator, not a representative of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| So no citation was issued that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Okay, before I call on the other two, is Ms. Abeyta there all the time, or are there managers for the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| We're in the process of hiring one because we haven't found one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| but she's going to be there from now on just to make sure that things run smoothly if the permit is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| We haven't heard from Mr. Wallace yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Is that the bartender that was cited that night, is he still employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| He's no longer employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| No, she actually quit, and we haven't heard of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| My feeling is I can kind of see how that got overlooked on number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1160)|
| 0:19:32| But that's so I'm, you know, she's filled out the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| If you want to make a motion on waiting until the hearing, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| But, I mean, personally, I wouldn't have a problem approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Let's wait until we hear from the people who have on license, if you don't mind, before we deal with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| I was going to make a motion, but I'll wait to defer to my colleagues and see what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| I was going to make a motion that we defer this until we find out what's going to happen legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| because I was just at a neighborhood meeting, and there are some concerns in that neighborhood with this particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| I believe I don't want to cause anybody who's trying to operate a business illegally any unnecessary problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1214)|
| 0:20:23| But there are concerns in the neighborhood with this particular place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| But I don't know what Councilman Grieve and Della Volpe were getting ready to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Well, let's go to Councilman Della Volpe and Councilman Grieve, then Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| I just have a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| It was related to what Dan was asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| But from what I heard so far, the hearing is going to address a bartender's action, an individual's action in serving a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| and it's not going to affect the business itself, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| In other words, the citation was to an individual, right, not the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| That's usually how it happens when we have a sale at a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| The citation is to the individual, not to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| It comes into play if they don't follow the rules set up in ordinance as far as submitting a remedial plan for a first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| or appearing before the beer board if it's a second offense within two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| But, of course, that only applies if they already have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| And like I said, at the time of the sale, we didn't know that the change had already occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| We were never notified by the previous owner that anything had changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Has anyone looked at the remedial plan to see if it would be the right type of steps one would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| In other words, I know you sent it out by e-mail, but has it been evaluated as effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Yeah, actually, the Metropolitan Drug Commission sat down with them and had bilingual copies, English and Spanish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| went through all the phases and all the components of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| and it was my understanding from Ms. Sutton at the Metropolitan Drug Commission that they understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| and that they don't want to come back here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| So I guess to answer Dan's question or proposition, waiting on sort of the prosecution of the bartender is not going to affect business per se, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1328)|
| 0:22:19| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| We do not have the previous owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| We actually tried contacting them to get it, but they changed the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| We have a copy of the beer permit, but we don't have the actual one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| They took it, so we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| But we have copies of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Just Mr. Frost, what do we do if we can't get the original beer permit back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| Well, there are some circumstances where that has occurred before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| and I'm sure ladies can correct me, where we'll still be able to issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| I mean, if someone makes off with it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| I mean, there can't be more than one permit for a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| so the previous one where someone's abandoned it doesn't impede someone new from coming in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Counselman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| I want to just kind of simplify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| So you had an establishment that had a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| And they no longer were going to sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| and so this individual came in to take over the business and started selling beer but did not have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| That's what we talked about at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| But we found out they didn't have the license because you cited the bartender for selling beer to an underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| So we have two situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| We had sell a beer to an underage, and then we had an establishment operating without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| So there is a hearing for the bartender, so there's no punitive action for selling beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1443)|
| 0:24:11| She can be cited for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| I've got 11 months, 29 days to issue a citation if we choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| We being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So what they're trying to do is correct that situation by getting a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| So there's nothing on the record about her selling beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Other than the minutes of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| This is just too steep a hill for me to climb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| There's just too many wrong things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| I think this would be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| I'm not going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I'll support deferring it if we want to do that, but I'm not going to vote in support of this license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| There's just too many things out there that tell me my instincts that they're not going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| It's just not going to be the right thing to do, so I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| Mayor Brown has made a motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| That would be May 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| That's a little more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Is there a second for that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Do we have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Is there a hearing date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| He didn't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| We don't know what that date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| The original date on the misdemeanor citation to be booked was March 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| but I haven't gotten notification of when the hearing date is going to be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| So we could be back here on May 28th and back in the same identical spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1538)|
| 0:25:45| Madam Chair, I'm going to make a motion that we defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| June 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| And I think that would allow time to deal with this matter a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| We've got a motion on the floor to defer the action on this permit until June 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| June 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| And you may not sell beer until you come back here on June 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| And that will give you plenty of time to have a manager hired or managers get them trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| and they know when the door is open, you have the permit, you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| They want to correct the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| And also to correct the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1595)|

| 0:31:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Counsel McGriff, this is your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| I'd like to postpone this until the gentleman's been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| That would be until May the 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Do I have a motion in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Is there a reason you haven't been in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| I had the GM go in and take the class and I did overlook that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| I have a restaurant currently in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| I had it for the last six years and I have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| I have zero problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| No citations, nothing, no problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| So I did overlook that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| I am set up, scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| I overlooked it this morning going over my paperwork and I called and couldn't get it processed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| So I am set up to do that on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| This Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Well, I'd like to weigh in that since you're set up this Thursday and these other inspections are coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| would you like to think about maybe approving pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| and take him at his word that he will get this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| and we will never see him again until he opens another restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| I can handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Vice Mayor Favalis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Well, I think this is a prime example of the discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| the debate that we've had about this process of just a blanket denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| I mean, he's got a proven track record and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| I wouldn't want to postpone him or the operation for another month when it could be finalized this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2002)|
| 0:33:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Understand, I didn't say deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| I said postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Well, excuse me, postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| So now, do you want to amend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Are you ready to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I mean, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| I'm looking at, like, May 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| I think we could be open, ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| There's some different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| I want to add a patio to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| There's a couple of things I want to do, freshen it up in the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| So my goal is May 10th, and there's a lot of the folks, the former employees of Silver Spoon that I could retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| You know, if I had to wait until May 28th, you know, it would be I'd love to open before the 28th if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2043)|
| 0:34:13| Do you think that's doable, opening before the 28th, get your work done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| It's a little up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| So I do think it's doable to get done, and my goal is the 10th, May 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| And remember, he said he doesn't want to come back and see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| George, we'll go there on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Well, I just don't like approving them if they haven't been in for process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| I think when you've had one person already, your manager, come in, and you have an existing restaurant and beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| I mean, I think that's an example where I'm willing to overlook that, and it's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| You're coming in on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| But, I mean, I just don't like doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| I don't think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| But I think in this case, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Mr. Counsel Mandela, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| If my memory serves me correctly, the prior business was tied to an outfit in Atlanta or South Carolina or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| and they had financial difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| And you're, like, springing off that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Well, I don't think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| It's a guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Actually, he's from Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| So he's from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| So, you know, he did have some issues, and we've worked through those issues to where I was able to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2114)|
| 0:35:24| or I'm obtaining and expanding on the Silver Spoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| And your hope is to, like you said, keep your staff and just kind of get up and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Yeah, I think they have a core group of folks, management team, which Amy's a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| that I'd like to retain and start getting them back to work and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| helping as far as getting the thing open and, you know, getting back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Well, good luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| We have a motion to approve this pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Counselman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| Exactly what was my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I don't think I made that motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| I thought you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| All I want to say is that I feel real uncomfortable doing this, and especially since you're the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and you set the guidelines and set the rules for the rest of your folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| And to overlook something like this, I think it's pretty serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| But I will stand by my motion that we approve pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| and that you'll be in Thursday for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| And you're going to keep the silver spoon menu sort of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I am going to do that and freshen it up a little bit and expand upon it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| And, yeah, I think there's a lot of tradition there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| and I think there's an opportunity to definitely expand upon the brand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| So I'm real excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| We have two left over, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Let's move to the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| M&M's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| There's still people here, so maybe they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| We'll get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| The KJ Mini Mart, what's the story on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2236)|
| 0:37:24| They've requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Kevin Cherry, 2634 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| And what are you asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| We first heard this in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| An extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| At first I had an agreeance with my landlord that he was going to build two handicap restrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| but he kind of backed out on the deal, so it's kind of left on me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| and financially I'm trying to work out with a loan or something to kind of get the bathrooms built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Would you be ready by May the 28th if we agreed to a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| An extension, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| You would be ready by May 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| We won't come back in here asking for another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Do I hear a motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| Extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Until May the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| The 28th of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| So by May the 28th you'll have the two handicap restrooms and be ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| We're going to come to those two that went to the hill after we do the rumors situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| Jumbo Holdings of Rumors was cited for underage sale, and under the TABC City of Knoxville situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2316)|
| 0:38:47| they had a suspension of their license and a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Allen Morton, 1820 Cumberland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Now, in this situation, we have had another establishment on Cumberland Avenue that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| in a similar deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| And as you know, our beer board doesn't actually hear these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| We send them to an administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| So I need a motion from this board for us to send this to the administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| Do I have such a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Mr. Frost, will you explain what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Well, Allison Ebertine in the law department will work to schedule a hearing date for rumors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| and she'll obviously give notice to the rumors representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| This is just part of this relatively new Tennessee state law that's a pilot project at TCA 57-4-202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2383)|
| 0:39:55| What happens when the state ABC suspends or revokes a liquor permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2395)|
| 0:40:04| they notify local beer boards of that, and the local beer boards are supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| or local communities are supposed to go through a process to have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| and can suspend or revoke the permit for an identical period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| So this is part of that state process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| So once you get the paperwork and the hearing is set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| you would have a suspension equal to that of the state suspension, right, and a possible fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| And this is a state law that we are required to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| In many cities, the beer boards hear these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| In the city of Knoxville, we have a hearing officer who does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| It usually works out quite smoothly for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Apparently the 10-day suspension has run through the end of March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| and this will be an additional hearing and potential suspension or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| depending on whatever the board finds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| What the hearing officer determines after a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| But it would be an additional suspension and or fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| But that would be up to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| It's up to their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| So you needed to appear before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| We have moved, seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| and approved that this will go to the administrating hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So you will be getting paperwork from the city about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| We appeared in November on the 27th and paid a fine then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| We're going to have an additional fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| That was to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| And this is the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| We appeared here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| We appeared here, and we paid a fine and submitted the remedial plan and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| They can fine us twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| They appeared in response to a second sale within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| We had an administrative hearing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| This is an action that the ABC has taken based on that most recent sale, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Most recent being the same sale or a different sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| The same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| The same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| The same that led them here to the admin hearing in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| So he's actually had that hearing on this sale before the beer board's hearing examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| When they have the second sale, they're required to appear before the beer board for an admin hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| and they're also required to submit a remedial plan and a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| That's what's being evaluated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| That's what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Since ABC were going to take them to a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and they agreed to a period of suspension under that new pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| they're required to notify the beer board that they have been issued a suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| and then it's up to you all to decide whether to go forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| I need a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2573)|
| 0:43:09| Officer Hunter, the sale that took place and the hearing that took place in December was for that very sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2589)|
| 0:43:19| the second sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Then ABC acted because he also sells liquor, I guess, on the same premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Is that what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| It's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| And now we're trying to evaluate whether we have, in essence, a third hearing on this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Well, our response tonight is in response to the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| We were responding to what happened first, and then the state has come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| and they have taken their action, and so now they have notified us that we have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| So this is where we are tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| And the hearing examiner might have discretion to decide that he's done enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| The hearing examiner could conceivably say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| We've been to this rodeo before, and we don't need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Or the hearing officer could do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| But all we're doing tonight is following state law, which then goes to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| And the hearing officer would certainly consider the circumstances, the previous hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| and the other things that you've just now brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| That probably won't make you sleep better tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| As long as we're just concerned that they're going to think this is another citation or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| This is our response to the state law that we have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| And we'll get notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| And do we go to the hearing, or do they just decide, and then they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Yes, you go to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Ms. Mitchell, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I will send you the notifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| And, yes, you will be expected to be there or have legal counsel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| But that will be the time that you explain what you've just told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Just to be clear, we've already penalized them for the charges as far as the city goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| We're following state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| We think we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| I happen to have a copy of the state law that's brought us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| It's specifically 57-4-202 Part C1A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2712)|
| 0:45:22| And I'll just briefly read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| When the Alcoholic Beverage Commission suspends the license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises of any establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| then it goes through the notice process that's given to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| The local or municipal beer board shall take the actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| And the actions that we are required by law to take are what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| But, once again, when the administrating hearing officer gets this, obviously what you've told us will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| And so we're following the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Our hands are kind of tied in the sense that we have local ordinances to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| and we have state law to follow in this specific kind of a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| So, Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| I'll go back to Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| You've already had that hearing, so no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| The state does not see that we have had that hearing until they get notification that we have had the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| Did we do them out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Did we jump too fast or we should have waited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I mean, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| We do not have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| We did what we do, and the state was slower in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| We've got another situation here that people were cited last week, and I got the paperwork from the state today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| They've kind of caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| They were behind in this pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Just a note of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| When an establishment gets or has two sales within two years, it comes to an administrative hearing before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| If they get a third sale, it goes to a hearing officer within that two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| This is kind of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| We had the administrative hearing when they had the second sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Now we're following state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| It's almost kind of parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| As if they had gotten a third sale, it goes on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Even though they didn't, we're following the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Does that make that clear as mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| But we're just having to follow the state law because the state law tells us we have to have this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| But the hearing officer will know that this is not a third citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| This is a pilot for city of Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| It originated in Chattanooga, and Knoxville was included, and Nashville, and it may go away in another next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2863)|
| 0:47:54| Actually, if local governments in this pilot program, if not, I'm not discussing rumors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| I'm discussing any business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| If they get suspended or revoked, we are in turn to notify the state, ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| who then they get to go through the process that they're making us go through with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| So there's a quid pro quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Whose legislation was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| It was a couple of legislators from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| This is when the law came about or the pilot program came about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| there was not a clear understanding that every beer board doesn't hear these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| And so initially, I guess it took eight or nine, maybe ten months to figure out how to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| And this was why there's such a lag time between TABC action and our already having taken care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2920)|
| 0:48:48| Now, we've got another club exile who was cited, I guess, two weeks ago or a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| and I got the paperwork for that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| So the state has figured out how to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| But meanwhile, rumors is caught kind of in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| But I believe that the hearing officer will know that this is not your third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| They're allowed to operate now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Yes, they're operating now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| We're not depriving them of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| And they have both a TABC and a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| And they're pouring both, except you're through with the ten-day period, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| You're over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| Was that during spring break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| That was a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| The only reason they're doing this is because I agreed to the ten-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| No, it would have not mattered if you had gone to Nashville or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| We would still be where we are tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| Madam Chair, I'm going to ask that I think we know where we are tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| but I'm going to ask that you refer this briefly to the city's legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| This man has already had the offense considered by a hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| and the idea that he has double jeopardy because of some pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| The goal was to make sure if they acted or we acted, the other body knew about it and did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| But in this case, we were the first guys out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| And for him to go back into the circle again seems a little unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| But I think we're stuck based on the ruling we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| But I would ask that you refer this to the legal department to see if this isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| That's considered constitutional double jeopardy or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| That's where it's going anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| And they will look at it and they may say you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| Councilman De La Vope was right on the money with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| But we do have to follow what the state law says at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| But meanwhile, we can all be, and I can say this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| we can all be thinking about how we're going to notify our local lawmakers that this isn't working for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| so that this doesn't become a permanent long-term thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| or at least if it does, it's adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| But this is, again, this is a pilot program, and I think it expires at the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| I was going to say most of those pilots would have a sunset date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| It definitely does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| And I'll check that and get that emailed out to you when it sunsets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| And I do have to add one thing, and that is that Cindy reminded me that his remedial plan has not been before our hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| So I guess technically he hasn't had that part resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| He had an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| He has not been before a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| And this is set to terminate July 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| So we've got not quite 18 months, a little over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| I'm afraid you're in the barrel with us for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Well, thank you so much for your patience in coming tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| and we will hopefully get this resolved and life will be good at rumors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| We also have Club Exile was cited and fined and have a suspension from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3106)|
| 0:51:55| and they will be coming to our beer board on May the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| at which time we will have the opportunity to refer them for the first time to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And this one was a very recent citation for Club Exile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| It's our second citation for a sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| This was a TABC citation and a city of Knoxville, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Now, we have people are gathering here in anticipation of counsel, so we need to hustle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| El Cazador Mexican Restaurant, does anybody here from that establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| There they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| There they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| You need to give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| My name is Guadalupe Rosas, and the address is 6409 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| We need a copy of the sales tax registration and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| We do have a copy of it, but we left it at the restaurant table on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| I make a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3181)|

| 0:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| You see Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3185)|

| 0:53:11| Going once is May 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| It's May the 3rd, so it won't happen if he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Ladies, have you spoken to this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| I mean, has anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| I mean, he knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| He knew he should be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Yes, he knew to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| They all get notification more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| I guess he's not having an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Or at least an event with liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| So what do we do now with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| We'll have another hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Vice Mayor or Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Could we just move it to the next beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| No, because the next beer board is May the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| Yeah, the third is the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| So hearing no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Well, can we just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| What is the event for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| We have a, this is the special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| This is not, and this has not been advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| And this becomes a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| I mean, you know, he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| We deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Anything else before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Hearing no other business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130416?start=3270)|
