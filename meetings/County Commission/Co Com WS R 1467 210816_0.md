| 0:08:11| the bill may come before payday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| And we found that simply by moving the bill date, that that can help folks with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| home economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Another, we found customers have trouble dealing if there's a damage, where a technician may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=501)|

| 0:08:35| And so our frontline staff really raised that as a pain point for customers, and we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| changes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=520)|

| 0:08:56| And so those are the innovations that you heard them reference in the video that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| helping us to better compete in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=540)|

| 0:21:03| instead of paying a half million dollars to get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1263)|

| 0:21:18| John Edwards, 621 Plainfield Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1278)|

| 0:21:24| I'm the system administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| So could you repeat your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| So my question was, I know when I was in the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| we bought all of our aerial data off of Google and uploaded it into our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| because it's more accurate satellite-driven all that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and they can zoom all the way down to your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I was asking, why are we paying almost $600,000 to have somebody do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| when we can probably buy it for a fraction off of a server that already has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| This product is more than aerial photography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| It's actually oblique views of homes and buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| So it's not just a straight down view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| They capture photography of all four sides of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| that the assessor uses in their appraisal processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Is there other discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Busler to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1334)|

| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| I would like and may come next week with a friendly amendment designating a smoking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1563)|

| 0:26:22| And I want to make sure that, one, we're not making some law that's unenforceable, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| two, that we're not denying children the ability to go to the park because of the bad habits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| of their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1593)|

| 0:26:44| child is told by their parents that I can't take you to the park or I'm not going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1604)|

| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So you're proposing to bring that next week as a friendly amendment when we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| So any further discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Commissioner Daley, did we model this language from the state bill or the public chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1624)|
| 0:27:15| that was approved by the state legislature and signed by the governor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| And people can smoke in a Knox County park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| They just can't smoke in the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| It says no use of tobacco vapor products on the grounds of a county-owned controlled park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| public park, playground, or public greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I would read that, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Is that solid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| It also says, or any public property that is accessible to use by the youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| So that could be the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| No, there are actually exclusions in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Oh, there are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Buildings, public right-of-ways, and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| But it does include the entirety of any park or ball field or greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1686)|
| 0:28:18| Did you get my question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I'll come back to my question in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Commissioner Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| It would have been great if somebody from the school system was still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| But aren't athletic facilities at the schools smoke-free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| I should know this, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| There are no smoking areas at, like, for instance, the football stadium or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| I have a question for the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Who would enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I would hopefully that our parks and rec are 81.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| They're not law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| I would hope that the field director at one of my parks that sees someone abusing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| would ask them to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| If they did not want to stop, then that would be a phone call to the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| That's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| And whether this be a question for the sponsor or the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| what is the penalty if somebody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| I'm smoking too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| I've got my rights and liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| That's a good question because when the legislature passed this statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| they didn't put any teeth to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| They didn't give any enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| They didn't say this violation is a misdemeanor or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| So there's no enforcement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Under our codes, violations of an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| and this might or might not be included in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| could be cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| But the bottom line is, it's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| The legislature just didn't provide for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| They just put this feel-good thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| And I believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I think it's a very good statute that they passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| but they just don't have any enforcement teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Or it could be a problem, let's put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| But I think Parks and Rec can certainly put up the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| and let everybody know this isn't it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| What happens after that, it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| I do know Saturday, quite a few other times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| my biggest field is Ballard Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| We have 435 youth playing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| So this fall ball, that'll mean probably at any one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| 800, 900 kids and parents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| And there's already signs that says no smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| It's not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| The only thing that's changing on our parks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| is that we're adding vaping, which is bigger now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Vaping is a bigger problem now than tobacco itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| Now it'll be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I don't expect it to be enforced unless someone is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| very abusive at one of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And I hope that never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I'm for exactly the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| I think that Representative Staples and Senator Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| they got it right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Mr. Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| This mirrors the legislation that we adopted in December of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| All it is, is like Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| is adding the term vapor products prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| So we already have it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| We're just adding something that the legislature missed the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I thought what we voted on last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| and Mr. Law Director, please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| was playgrounds only, and it didn't have vaping on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| If you compare this, and I don't have the comparison with me in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| but there was more than just the vapor, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| They added, Staples added to his bill, which was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| these other greenways, and I don't remember what else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Like I say, I don't have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Yes, there were other places that were amended and added to it under Staples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| from what you passed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| I'll just, I don't see any of the lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I'll just say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I just, I think, look, I believe in the sentiment of the exercise here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| to reduce smoking, vaping, and all of those in our public playgrounds and areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| If we're adding another layer of government that will not be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and not leave a lot of options, I don't, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| it makes us feel good, but I'm not sure what it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| to help Knox County be a happier, healthier place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| But, that being said, it's not a good versus bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| It's just, it's the nature of government right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Thank you, Chairman. I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| So, basically, by putting it on greenways, what we're saying is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| is if you're jogging, biking, or, I don't think, you know, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| down a greenway, you won't be following a person with a cigarette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| So, what you're saying is, is if we have zoning specific smoke zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| like Commissioner Smith's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| they would be designated in that specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| But, also, I would say if we asked Sheriff Linebacker, Chief Linebacker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| if he's willing to pull a person off of a call to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| okay, yeah, just by shaking his head, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| then I kind of get the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| We're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| And, like you said, you know, there's no enforcement mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Right. Yeah. So, good points by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| But, yeah, I mean, I definitely see what's being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| I agree with the intent of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And, I think it, nobody likes smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Everybody wishes everybody would quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| But, right now, we have just no smoking signs and nobody paying attention to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| If we had this law in place with designated areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| I think people would be respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and would at least conjugate to those designated areas to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| I believe they're going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| there is a motion on the floor to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2114)|

| 0:37:50| and is currently being processed by our Knox County planning team and the GIS team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| It is—I think everybody's got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| It comes in as raw data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Just as a reminder, we are fortunate to have a planning department that has some data analysts on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| as part of the team that are doing an exceptional job to crunch through all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| There are a lot of counties that have to wait for a whole other round of interpretation coming up by the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| As sent to you earlier, you can see the ranking of our most populous counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| Knoxville sits at No. 3 with a population of 478,971 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2308)|
| 0:38:36| That is third largest in the state and an increase pretty dramatically here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| It looks like we're growing quite healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Of course, if you look at other counties in the state, their growth is off the charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| So whether that's a canary in the coal mine for us or not is to be determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| but I think across the board when you see the entire state growing at an exceptional rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| that should give us some pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Shared down at the bottom are some demographic characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| You can look at the 2010 census, the 2000 census, and, of course, our most recent 2020 census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| and you can see the breakdown of our population demographics by characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| And it includes also some housing units, which is interesting to compare against the inventory sheets of our real estate professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2361)|
| 0:39:30| But it gives you a little bit of a breakdown of the changing demographics in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| More, of course, is being processed and will be delivered soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Just to update on the process and the timeline, a few additional items have been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| In June, we started working on the actual website that will be delivered to you all on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| They are currently – I've seen a preview and given some feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| I met with planning last week and walked through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| This will be the public-facing portal, so to speak, or the website that will include both the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| and the way for the public to interact and engage and offer feedback in addition to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| We have completed a majority of the action items and sent in the information to our comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| We have received the first batch or the legacy format, which is essentially the unformatted data that came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2418)|
| 0:40:27| and we are processing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| Just a reminder, the schedule did change since our original planning, but, of course, you guys have received these dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| We will have our initial redistricting committee meeting on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| This is after our commission reorganization, where we will go through all of these items and maybe some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| And then we will hold our meetings in a series of five additional meetings between September and October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| You'll notice that there is a significant break between September 23rd and October 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| This is for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| The planning department asked for a little bit of time after the first initial meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| because it seems to be around that third meeting that big scenarios or things need to be really reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| and they wanted some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| It also falls, that period of time falls with fall break, and a lot of people are gone with families and children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| and so there's a buffer in between, and that kind of overlaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| Our goal, of course, in this entire process is to finish the committee work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| which will include final votes and recommendations to the full commission by October 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| That's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| That way we can have our two readings in November, final public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| and submit all of the final reports to the comptroller in December because our deadline is December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| So it is an aggressive timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| As I said to many people, this is normally a six-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| It's going to be crammed into about six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| It is going to be quite intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| I really appreciate everybody's engagement and involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| The committee members, of course, are all 11 of us as county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Our school board of education chair, that is currently Susan Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| If it remains, then she will join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| As a committee member, as a voting member, and then our election commission administrator, Chris Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| and then we will have representatives from the law department, the KGIS team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| and the planning department to help guide us along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| So a little bit of update, a little bit of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Happy to answer any questions anybody might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Yes, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Do we know when the school board is going to do their reorganization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| Is it not the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| It may be the same night at the Andrew Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| From my understanding, it's the same night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| That's why Susan can't attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| No, it's the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Oh, they do theirs the same evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Okay, they hadn't informed me of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| I think we're locked in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| We're like three weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| We can double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Commissioner Bussard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Could I request that we also get from our election commission our precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| and how they're linked inside our districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| I'm sorry, just repeat that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| I want a map of our precincts inside of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| The first meeting, you will all be presented with three different maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| and they will be both given to you digitally as well as they will be given to you in large scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| One will be the voting precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Another one will be the districts as whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and then the third one will be districts with neighborhoods and more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| So those will be brought on the very first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| We can certainly get you that in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| On the first night, everybody's going to be presented with a whole set of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| The reason why I'm asking for it early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| we all probably have some precincts in our area that are not active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| and I know I've got one in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| I've got seven precincts in my district, but only six are active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| I'm happy to send that, ask your request to get that early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker is showing that there are work sessions on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Commissioner Hill, do you know if they reorganize it at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| or is there a special session usually in years past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| It typically is a special policy for the item involved in the work transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2692)|
| 0:45:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Other questions, comments, thoughts about redistricting from anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| If you have any further questions, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Item number 53, discussion item, Spring 2022 Countywide Cleanup Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| Commissioner Dirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| I am partnering with the mayor's office to do a countywide cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| I've worked with Keep Knoxville Beautiful in the past to do the North Knox cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| and we're going to look to expand that to all nine districts in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| It's very early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| We are very much open to ideas on how to plan this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| if we need to have a pickup location for supplies in each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| or if we want to do it where we offer it for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| and then whatever volunteer groups are going to be participating have that whole week to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| and then have another drop-off the following weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| I mean, it's very much early on in the formation of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| But, of course, your help would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| We need supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Keep Knoxville Beautiful does have supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| but they don't have enough to support something this large, or businesses to donate money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| If you know anybody who could do that so we could purchase those supplies to then go towards Keep Knoxville Beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| And we also need a catchy name, so just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| I think the last time we discussed it, I don't know if it was in a committee meeting or if it was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| we actually talked about having a combined effort with the city council and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| and working closely with Engineering and Public Works and their EPW equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| to do sort of the great Knox County cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| I think we even looked at or talked about like the first Saturday in March or somewhere in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| It was sort of before everything greens up again so you can see all the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| I think that was the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| But I'm fairly certain that both bodies, as well as both engineering groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| I think everybody would be happy to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| I know Commissioner Daly and I are often on those cleanups and are thinking about how do we continue to broaden the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| So I think you'll see a lot of support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Yeah, I would suggest, Courtney, that I know South Knoxville, we do ours in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| We usually have 215 people show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| It would be nice if we could do it all in one day, but I don't think Knoxville is capable of doing all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| I spoke with Alana this morning, and she is willing to head up any kind of planning committee that we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| or planning meetings, head up volunteers to help run those nine locations if we did it all in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2879)|
| 0:48:09| And, of course, that would foster greater participation, I feel like, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2889)|
| 0:48:14| So I think we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| It's just going to definitely be an all-hands-on-deck kind of scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| Yeah, I would like to push through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| Mr. Thurmond, would you like to join us at the podium as the king of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| You know, it's early stages and everything, but, you know, it's habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| In the South, we've got the habit of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| So we'd look like April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Drew, I know it's – go ahead, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Yeah, Drew Thurmond, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Solid Waste Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| So, yeah, we do actually participate in some countywide efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| There's the River Rescue, and I'm glad that you spoke to Alana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| They actually – a lot of those supplies do come directly from the solid waste budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| So we'd be very interested in partnering with any of those efforts that you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| That was one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| If this commission has to designate some more funds for trash bags or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2957)|
| 0:49:27| I think that we should be able to come up with it, and I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| I would say – I mean, I would love funding for all kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| but I would hope that any of our existing funding should be sufficient to augment any kind of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2976)|
| 0:49:44| And I would say a lot of times when any time someone wants to plan something, a lot of times we just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| our limitations may be in staff and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| So as Commissioner Dritt mentioned, all hands on deck, having lots of people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| that's a lot of times our biggest problem is if somebody wants to do something on a single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| and there's 50, 100, 30 different sites, it depends on what scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| The level of support from the department often is, can you come – once we remove it from this wide area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| and we consolidate it into one point, then it's like, can you all come and get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| And sometimes that becomes a pretty big ask for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| We have these seven convenience centers that are open six days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| so if that cleanup was timed where the folks who were kind of partnering or a captain of a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| could load it up in their vehicle and take it to our centers, that's the best –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| that's how we would like to support is letting you know you can bring these things to our convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| But, yeah, we'd be happy to partner and sit on a committee or whatever, any way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| And we do have funds available, so I'm optimistic that we could help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| Mr. Thurman, would you be able to also just – there's a downstream effect to the expense side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| I know on the cleanups I've been on, I've taken a truck and a trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| and that's just one stretch of road to our convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Obviously that costs money to both process and take to further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| If you can imagine, you know, 100 of me going to Carnes and then, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| Yeah, that was the pandemic, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| But I guess if you could just, while we're thinking about this, think about if this was a community-wide initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| and there were 500 teams out there all across Knox County in every district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| what would it cost in bags, what would it cost in pickers, what would it cost in downstream effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| And then maybe if we do need appropriate funds, we would have a better understanding of how to support your operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| Well, I would probably want to base those estimates on something realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| So if we were to say that we think we're going to have 2,000 volunteers and 10 sites, I'd probably come up with some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| Then if you said, you know, 20,000 volunteers and 100 sites, there's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| And how big those sites are, how much, probably the volunteers is probably the biggest indicator of how many bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| You can imagine maybe you have one volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| They're pretty productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| They could get 10 bags an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I mean, I would back to the napkin type estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| It would be that's how I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| And a number of people would then kind of inform how many grabbers you might need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| And those things have a cost, and we have an inventory of those that we loan out, and we might have to get more of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| Not everybody wants a grabber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Some people like to bend over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Some people like a poker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| But we can kind of, you know, we can do really good estimates on those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| I would say, again, probably the most difficult thing on all of these has always been coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| There used to be actually two separate community-wide cleanup events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| One happened, it was always the first Saturday of December, which was always the SEC championship game weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| So I was every, for the first several years I was on Solid Waste, that first Saturday of December we were out either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| it was also coordinated with some planting of trees, like Basilian Blooms did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| But we'd be out cleaning, and that was called Clean, Protect, and Restore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| It was CPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| It was a watershed cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| So it wasn't just the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| It was anywhere where something could eventually wash into the river and the creek or the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| And they later actually combined that because they were having this planning effort that we were doing for December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| and then four months later we would work with IAMS, and we would kind of reproduce that same thing, site captain, similar model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| And CPR merged with River Rescue with IAMS, and IAMS actually does a really good job of coordinating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3227)|
| 0:53:56| where they have, it is not just the people going out on boats cleaning along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| It's also upstream along roads or where maybe roads and bridges cross over where the rights-of-way kind of go along streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| So it is more of a watershed-focused event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| But there's also parks and caves and trails and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| So I don't want to make it sound like that that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| I'm just saying you can expand, but you could also expand with an existing network of coordination and volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| Or maybe it would be required because you have so many volunteers on this one weekend with River Rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| maybe you would want to do it two weeks later because you couldn't tap into that entire volunteer community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| unless you did it over the course of two or three different weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| So, again, I'm just offering we'd be happy to sit on any kind of committee or planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| I mean, that's what I'm paid to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| And Alana at Keep Nassau Beautiful, they do a lot of this type of stuff too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| So they would be a great representative on that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| Commissioner Daley, did you have further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Yes, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| Of course, Drew, as you well know, we do this on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Yes, typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| My convenience center is lined up from 7 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| so we'll have to have extra compactors up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| I'm sure all the other convenience centers are the same as John Severity's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| It's crowded on Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| Right, and sometimes the way we do that, which is what I was saying about the coordination, advanced coordination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| is let's just say we knew that there was going to be one area that there was going to be a lot of groups cleaning up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3334)|
| 0:55:44| We might set an open-top container kind of in a parking lot somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| and tell everybody who's cleaning up in that part of the town, well, don't take it to the convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| Take it, consolidate it, and put it in this open-top container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| Groups that are a small group that's going to pick up this one little part of their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| we might direct those to go to a convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| In some aspects, if it's a dangerous part of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| we might even tell people just to leave it alongside and we'll come back and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| So we have a variety of different ways that we could assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| Sometimes we would prefer it to be get you to the convenience center or having you bring your own bags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| but as you said, if it's giant loads, that causes wait times, it causes more people to be frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| and sometimes we just don't have the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| But normally we could even set up some type of extra capacity, say at John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| which is your convenience center, that would be like an open-top container| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| specifically for groups that are coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| If we had enough coordination and advanced planning, I'm confident that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| We can handle waste and large amounts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| The last experience from the great South Knoxville cleanup is that we put the dumpster there at Duffield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| and the city residents, homeowners groups and all that, they'll bring all theirs there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| because the city don't have a convenience center like we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| So they bring the dumpster there, and we're out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| there are Boy Scouts and homeowners groups, and we just load it in the back of the truck like you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and take it to the convenience center and drop it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| Yeah, and when we leave containers, we get some illegal dumping in the containers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| but it's like those folks were already dumping illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| At least they found a trash container that they illegally dumped it into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| We're not going to stop illegal dumping, but we can make it a whole lot easier for us to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3450)|
| 0:57:44| Okay, we'll come back around. Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Courtney, is this going to be a specific theme that you're going to have from year after year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| that you're going to do this? Is it going to be especially design and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| So it's something you're going to continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Theme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| Like a branded name and, you know, the great Knox County cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| If you've got a time specific, we can make up flyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| and I know out in my area we used to do the cleanup on Emory Road by the ladies league out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| and I know there's other groups in like the business professionals and things like that would be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| If we get the flyers out soon enough, we can make it a big contest between all different communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| Yeah, that was something else we were discussing is making it a contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| I think you're hearing everybody would be happy to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| Let us know when the first meeting is and we'll all be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| A few other bits of other business ahead of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| While we're on later and all that, I'd like to give Mr. Snowden to come up with a little update on our environmental officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| We did pass in our budget this year to have an environmental officer, and we do have a job description ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| and Jim has met with the chair, so I'm going to have him tell us exactly where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| That was a position that got funded in the current budget we're in, so we want to get that person on board pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| Drew's worked up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| This position will probably actually assist in three different agencies within Engineering Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| We deal with building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| We deal with zoning as well as stormwater and littering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| so this person will actually serve many hats within our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| We do have the job description finalized for all those different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Chris, Mr. Caldwell, and I met with Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| Chris, Mr. Caldwell, and I met with Sheriff Spangler last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| He is going to bring that up to his divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| The salary we're offering, we think that we would have a good candidate that may just want to be interested in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| so hopefully within the next few weeks we should be able to get that person onboarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| and get them assisting our organization with better compliance with not only the litter ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| but also we have illicit discharges in stormwater, as well as we have problematic folks with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| People don't want to mow their yard and things like that, so it's going to be a really big help for our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| A couple of quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| A reminder for everybody, we have a joint session with our friends on the City Council this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3633)|
| 1:00:42| the 19th at 530, right here in this room, regarding the Stadium Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| The seating will be different from where you are now, so please come in and look for your nameplate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| as we have two legislative bodies working together on that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| Some information may be sent to you in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| We'll be certainly available to you at the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| We also have reorganization Wednesday, the 1st of September at 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| and redistricting also at 530 on that same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| So please make sure you have all of those in your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| We appreciate all your participation in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| I'll open up the floor for other announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Commissioner Ward, did you leave us off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| I'm sure a lot of people have seen the news over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| and today, with everything that's going on in Afghanistan, I served over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| so I just had a couple of thoughts I wanted to share with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| Unfortunately, over the weekend, I got news that one of the guys that I used to work with over there got killed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| and I don't know where his family is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| He wasn't able to get out in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| He was a local Afghani special ops guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| It's been an emotional couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| so I just want to make sure that Afghanistan is a tough thing to explain to people that haven't been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| and what it's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| I feel for the people because there's a lot of them that wanted freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| and wanted democracy and what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| We don't understand how blessed we are to have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| and I fear now that a lot of those people that helped us try to achieve that goal are now going to die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| and their kids are going to be married off or put into slavery or even killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3744)|
| 1:02:31| It's not good from everything that I've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| and it's going to probably get worse before it ever gets better again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| So I just want everybody to just keep those people in your prayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| and if there are veterans that you know that served over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| just reach out to them and make sure they're doing okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| I've probably talked to almost every member of my team over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| and everybody processes it differently and handles it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| There's a lot of good memories and a lot of bad memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| but it's just very sad to put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| It's just very, very sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| Drew is going to put up a picture for me on a happier note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3798)|
| 1:03:25| Kyle, I wasn't in the service, but having a lot of family members that bond between you guys is unbreakable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| Just my father-in-law, he served in World War II in Korea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| His buddy, they kept in contact with each other until the day they died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| She's trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Well, she's pulling that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| I will just mention that we have a great team with our veteran affairs group, BUZZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3830)|
| 1:03:56| and everybody does a wonderful job supporting our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| This Saturday we have, and really every Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| but I know this Saturday in our Commissioner Buster's district we have the PAL Veterans Breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and every Saturday at different places around the county there's always an opportunity to support our veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| in one of those places as well as all of our other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| First Saturday is at the Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Second Saturday is South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Third Saturday is PAL, and fourth Saturday could be either Oliver Springs or Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210816?start=3862)|
