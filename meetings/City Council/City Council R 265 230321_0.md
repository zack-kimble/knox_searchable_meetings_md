| 0:02:07| Next up, we have the approval of the minutes from Tuesday, March 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=127.0)|
| 0:02:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=130.0)|
| 0:02:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=131.0)|
| 0:02:12| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=132.0)|
| 0:02:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=133.0)|
| 0:02:14| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=134.0)|
| 0:02:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=136.0)|
| 0:02:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=137.0)|
| 0:02:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=138.0)|
| 0:02:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=139.0)|
| 0:02:20| All right, that brings us to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=140.0)|
| 0:02:23| Are there any items to be withdrawn this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=143.0)|
| 0:02:29| Are there any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=149.0)|
| 0:02:33| Are there any items requested to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=153.0)|
| 0:02:38| Our consent agenda is 11N through 11O and 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=158.0)|
| 0:02:46| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=166.0)|
| 0:02:47| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=167.0)|
| 0:02:48| I would like to take 12D off of consent and hear it at the regular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=168.0)|
| 0:02:54| That's simply some housekeeping items, and basically it's 202 funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=174.0)|
| 0:02:59| and I would like to add some to my amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=179.0)|
| 0:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=182.0)|
| 0:03:03| As consent requires unanimous vote, with that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=183.0)|
| 0:03:07| that item is removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=187.0)|
| 0:03:09| So 12D will show up in the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=189.0)|
| 0:03:12| I have other consent items in 11N through 11O, or 11N and 11O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=192.0)|
| 0:03:19| Mr. Thomas, do you have any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=199.0)|
| 0:03:21| I would make a motion to approve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=201.0)|
| 0:03:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=204.0)|
| 0:03:25| I've got a motion and I've got a second to approve 11N and 11O on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=205.0)|
| 0:03:30| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=210.0)|
| 0:03:32| I've got a motion, I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=212.0)|
| 0:03:34| Second, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=214.0)|
| 0:03:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=215.0)|
| 0:03:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=216.0)|
| 0:03:37| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=217.0)|
| 0:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=220.0)|
| 0:03:42| Moving on now to reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=222.0)|
| 0:03:45| Citizens of Knoxville, Mayor Kincannon and this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=225.0)|
| 0:03:49| has maintained the closest possible focus on bills being introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=229.0)|
| 0:03:53| by the General Assembly that impact your rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=233.0)|
| 0:03:56| When we first learned of a bill that would limit your voting rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=236.0)|
| 0:03:59| in late February, we alerted you, and on March 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=239.0)|
| 0:04:03| city council traveled to Nashville to meet with members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=243.0)|
| 0:04:05| of the Knox County delegation to the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=245.0)|
| 0:04:09| This morning, we learned that a bill is again moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=249.0)|
| 0:04:12| that will disenfranchise Knoxville voters in the selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=252.0)|
| 0:04:16| of our district representatives on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=256.0)|
| 0:04:18| SB 526 will be taken up by the Senate State and Local Government Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=258.0)|
| 0:04:24| between now and early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=264.0)|
| 0:04:26| If passed and signed into law, the bill would limit Knoxville city voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=266.0)|
| 0:04:30| to voting only for their district representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=270.0)|
| 0:04:33| rather than our current system, which empowers all city voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=273.0)|
| 0:04:37| to participate in each district's citywide general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=277.0)|
| 0:04:41| Mayor Kincannon and council strongly oppose this legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=281.0)|
| 0:04:45| because the voice of Knoxville city voters should not be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=285.0)|
| 0:04:50| to district voting only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=290.0)|
| 0:04:52| Our focus should be on expanding voter connection to representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=292.0)|
| 0:04:56| not limiting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=296.0)|
| 0:04:58| Knoxville has been a home rule city for nearly 70 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=298.0)|
| 0:05:02| and we have operated our elections in the same manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=302.0)|
| 0:05:05| as adopted by the people of Knoxville for the past 54 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=305.0)|
| 0:05:09| SB 526 replaces the will of the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=309.0)|
| 0:05:13| as adopted by public referendum for that of the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=313.0)|
| 0:05:18| What is at stake is your ability to have local control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=318.0)|
| 0:05:22| over local matters of your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=322.0)|
| 0:05:24| Here's what you can do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=324.0)|
| 0:05:26| First, contact your state representatives and tell them you oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=326.0)|
| 0:05:30| this unwarranted and extraordinary attempt to undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=330.0)|
| 0:05:33| and circumvent the will of the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=333.0)|
| 0:05:36| Second, attend a special called city council meeting tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=336.0)|
| 0:05:40| March 22nd at 6 p.m. here in the small assembly room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=340.0)|
| 0:05:44| of the city county building located at 400 Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=344.0)|
| 0:05:48| and support the resolution of city council opposing SB 526.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=348.0)|
| 0:05:53| Decisions made by vote of the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=353.0)|
| 0:05:56| should only be overruled by vote of the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=356.0)|
| 0:06:00| We hope we will see you tomorrow night. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=360.0)|
| 0:06:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=363.0)|
| 0:06:08| Now I'll move to reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=368.0)|
| 0:06:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=372.0)|
| 0:06:14| Yeah, I have one announcement and a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=374.0)|
| 0:06:19| First, I'd like to announce that the Dogwood Arts is kicking off next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=379.0)|
| 0:06:25| and the ribbon-cutting and official trail opening will begin on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=385.0)|
| 0:06:31| March 29th between 5 and 7 p.m. at the Fountain City Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=391.0)|
| 0:06:36| and Historic Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=396.0)|
| 0:06:37| Very excited, and that neighborhood is very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=397.0)|
| 0:06:39| and has put a lot of time and effort into planning that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=399.0)|
| 0:06:42| So please come out and celebrate the spring tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=402.0)|
| 0:06:45| as we officially open the Dogwood Trails on Wednesday, March 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=405.0)|
| 0:06:49| There will be music, food trucks, and kids' activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=409.0)|
| 0:06:52| and the ribbon will be cut around 5.30 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=412.0)|
| 0:06:55| so I hope we'll see everyone there to kick off the Dogwood Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=415.0)|
| 0:06:59| I just want to follow up on Vice Mayor Roberto's remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=419.0)|
| 0:07:05| It's very important that the state senators hear from people in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=425.0)|
| 0:07:11| not just the Knoxville City Council representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=431.0)|
| 0:07:14| but we were elected by all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=434.0)|
| 0:07:17| and so we hope that you will go and encourage your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=437.0)|
| 0:07:21| to contact the senators and let them know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=441.0)|
| 0:07:23| particularly the delegation that represents Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=443.0)|
| 0:07:26| but all of them, that you support the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=446.0)|
| 0:07:29| and also please sign up to speak at tomorrow night's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=449.0)|
| 0:07:33| If the city and the citizens of Knoxville want to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=453.0)|
| 0:07:36| how our elections are done here per the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=456.0)|
| 0:07:40| and per our city charter, which is the format for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=460.0)|
| 0:07:44| then we need to hear from you that you want to change how our elections run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=464.0)|
| 0:07:47| and we need to follow that format, which is the legal process for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=467.0)|
| 0:07:52| So would appreciate hearing from everyone on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=472.0)|
| 0:07:55| and you voicing yourself in that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=475.0)|
| 0:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=478.0)|
| 0:07:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=479.0)|
| 0:08:00| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=480.0)|
| 0:08:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=486.0)|
| 0:08:09| I want to echo some comments made by Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=489.0)|
| 0:08:16| that this conversation should include the voices of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=496.0)|
| 0:08:21| One perspective I wanted to bring into this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=501.0)|
| 0:08:25| is a conversation that we've had in past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=505.0)|
| 0:08:29| perhaps not as a council, but in various spaces in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=509.0)|
| 0:08:35| and it's been reported on, but there have been questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=515.0)|
| 0:08:38| by residents of our community for many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=518.0)|
| 0:08:42| about whether our current electoral system is constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=522.0)|
| 0:08:50| and whether the system that we have in place does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=530.0)|
| 0:08:59| for especially our minority residents to have a voice in the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=539.0)|
| 0:09:05| and there have been questions around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=545.0)|
| 0:09:07| I know there have been arguments made that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=547.0)|
| 0:09:10| predominantly the winner of primaries in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=550.0)|
| 0:09:17| will win their general election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=557.0)|
| 0:09:20| but I also wonder how many people have chosen not to run for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=560.0)|
| 0:09:26| because they do not believe they can win that citywide race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=566.0)|
| 0:09:30| and so I feel like we have a deeper conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=570.0)|
| 0:09:34| that we need to have with our residents about the electoral system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=574.0)|
| 0:09:39| and I just wanted to lift that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=579.0)|
| 0:09:40| and look forward to the conversation tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=580.0)|
| 0:09:44| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=584.0)|
| 0:09:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=586.0)|
| 0:09:47| I just want to announce that the East Knoxville community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=587.0)|
| 0:09:51| will be held on April 11th at the Jacobs Building from 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=591.0)|

| 0:10:00| that have been held, I think, so far in South and North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=600.0)|
| 0:10:04| There will be booths and stations with different projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=604.0)|
| 0:10:07| that are going on in East Knoxville, such as Magnolia Streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=607.0)|
| 0:10:11| Burlington Streetscape, East Knoxville Greenway Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=611.0)|
| 0:10:15| Morningside Park, and some other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=615.0)|
| 0:10:17| so I encourage everyone to please come out and join us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:19| for that meeting and conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=619.0)|
| 0:10:22| What I will add is that I do look forward to as many people as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=622.0)|
| 0:10:27| coming to the meeting tomorrow to voice your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=627.0)|
| 0:10:31| and what your thoughts and opinions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=631.0)|
| 0:10:34| as we move forward at the state level with this bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=634.0)|
| 0:10:37| and as city council takes a position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=637.0)|
| 0:10:41| So I encourage everyone to please come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=641.0)|
| 0:10:43| and ask other people to come out as well tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=643.0)|

| 0:11:01| There's been a number of public input meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=661.0)|
| 0:11:04| one-on-one conversations, surveys on CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=664.0)|
| 0:11:09| We will not vote on CAT reimagined this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=669.0)|
| 0:11:12| but we will discuss a lot of the public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=672.0)|
| 0:11:14| that's been collected over the past three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=674.0)|

| 0:12:10| Doesn't look like he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=730.0)|
| 0:12:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=731.0)|

| 0:12:41| Chapter 22.5, to update and modernize stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=761.0)|
| 0:12:45| and site development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=765.0)|
| 0:12:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=768.0)|

| 0:12:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=772.0)|
| 0:12:53| Oh, we do have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=773.0)|
| 0:12:55| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=775.0)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=776.0)|
| 0:12:57| I just wondered if there is somebody who can educate us on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=777.0)|
| 0:13:02| just talk about it, tell us what it is in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=782.0)|
| 0:13:08| Go ahead, Mr. Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=788.0)|
| 0:13:10| Thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=790.0)|
| 0:13:12| So this ordinance amendment is addressing three different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=792.0)|
| 0:13:19| One of those is there's currently a requirement to apply stormwater easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=799.0)|
| 0:13:27| access easements, and any control easements at the front of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=807.0)|
| 0:13:33| and we're going to move that requirement to the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=813.0)|
| 0:13:36| So you need to get that work done before you have a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=816.0)|
| 0:13:41| So it's really an issue of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=821.0)|
| 0:13:44| Sometimes that holds projects up trying to get through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=824.0)|
| 0:13:48| So by moving it to the end, we still get the requirements, get the access we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=828.0)|
| 0:13:52| but it doesn't hold the project up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=832.0)|
| 0:13:55| The second issue was there's minor revisions to what we're using as hydrologic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=835.0)|
| 0:14:03| design standards, so it's something the industry is using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=843.0)|
| 0:14:08| and we've been using that or allowing that kind of on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=848.0)|
| 0:14:14| but it's something we need to kind of codify, so we're going to allow that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=854.0)|
| 0:14:19| And then the last one is this idea of defining a threshold for substantial improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=859.0)|
| 0:14:28| So in that case, right now it was a 50% improvement with no minimum or floor to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=868.0)|
| 0:14:37| and we're going to set that to $500,000 in improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=877.0)|
| 0:14:41| So it really assists with smaller projects or projects where the property value may not be as much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=881.0)|
| 0:14:49| so those smaller projects were being kicked into doing a lot of stormwater improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=889.0)|
| 0:14:56| even with minor renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=896.0)|
| 0:14:59| So by setting this threshold, it prevents that from adversely impacting development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=899.0)|
| 0:15:06| and smaller developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=906.0)|
| 0:15:08| My only concern is stormwater becomes a bigger and bigger issue over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=908.0)|
| 0:15:12| so I know that you guys keep that in consideration and are aware of that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=912.0)|
| 0:15:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=920.0)|
| 0:15:21| Yeah, I just, for the record, again, I'm going to restate that I made the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=921.0)|
| 0:15:26| and I'll be voting for this, but I have grave opposition to Part A that we will be updating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=926.0)|
| 0:15:35| hopefully in the future, which involves the definition of a lot of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=935.0)|
| 0:15:39| because everything in our historic areas of town prior to 1950-something, which is about 60-plus percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=939.0)|
| 0:15:50| I believe you've said anywhere from 60-80 percent of our parcels in the older parts of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=950.0)|
| 0:15:56| this impacts their ability to be able to get permits for any work that they would do to the exterior of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=956.0)|
| 0:16:03| So I'm not going to stop talking about a lot of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=963.0)|
| 0:16:07| and how we in Knoxville do not define it the same as other places within the state of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=967.0)|
| 0:16:12| nor the city of Asheville, and I look forward to the day when we correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=972.0)|
| 0:16:16| and rectify this so that people in my community can get their sheds and things with permits as intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=976.0)|
| 0:16:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=984.0)|
| 0:16:25| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=985.0)|
| 0:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=986.0)|
| 0:16:27| May I add one comment to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=987.0)|
| 0:16:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=988.0)|
| 0:16:30| In the last meeting, we said amen to Council Member Ryder's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=990.0)|
| 0:16:35| and we've made a commitment for when that will come before this body that it has not and will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=995.0)|
| 0:16:41| There is an element of that part of this ordinance change that I think is important to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1001.0)|
| 0:16:48| Right now, we're requiring developments to record a plat so that we have the stormwater easements in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1008.0)|
| 0:16:55| before construction even begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1015.0)|
| 0:16:58| Most of the time, that construction has tweaks that require adjustments to the easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1018.0)|
| 0:17:03| which require that plat to be resubmitted and resurveyed, resubmitted, and reapproved and filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1023.0)|
| 0:17:11| Our goal is to eliminate one of those processes to make it more lean, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1031.0)|
| 0:17:17| Asking for the first plat was not appropriate, so I don't want that to get lost in the midst of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1037.0)|
| 0:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1043.0)|
| 0:17:24| And I thank you for the work thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1044.0)|
| 0:17:26| and I look forward to the ticker tape parade when we're done with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1046.0)|
| 0:17:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1052.0)|
| 0:17:34| I've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1054.0)|
| 0:17:35| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1055.0)|
| 0:17:36| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1056.0)|
| 0:17:37| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1057.0)|
| 0:17:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1059.0)|
| 0:17:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1060.0)|
| 0:17:42| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1062.0)|
| 0:17:44| 9C is an ordinance to change the base zoning of property located at 308 Southgate Street from DKH to DKG District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1064.0)|
| 0:17:52| Seth Schweitzer, applicant for 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1072.0)|

| 0:18:08| 11A is a resolution to add the honorary name Home Run Alley to a segment of Sutherland Avenue from Jade Road to Renford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1088.0)|
| 0:18:16| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1096.0)|

| 0:18:19| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1099.0)|
| 0:18:20| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1100.0)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1101.0)|
| 0:18:22| I believe the applicant, Mr. Williams, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1102.0)|
| 0:18:23| Mr. Williams, would you like to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1103.0)|
| 0:18:26| Mr. Williams, when you come to the podium, please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1106.0)|
| 0:18:30| David Williams, 505 Hollywood Road, long life member of the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1110.0)|
| 0:18:37| This is a part of a project that's been close to my heart and others in the Pond Gap community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1117.0)|
| 0:18:41| to honor integrated baseball games played on Sutherland Field from the 30s, 40s, into the 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1121.0)|
| 0:18:49| It was quite common on a Sunday afternoon to watch an integrated audience watch integrated games played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1129.0)|
| 0:18:55| And in Pond Gap, we said that baseball for us was more than a game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1135.0)|
| 0:18:58| It's a way people should treat one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1138.0)|
| 0:19:01| And the reasoning behind this honorary name change is because the good power hitters could hit a home run ball across Sutherland from the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1141.0)|
| 0:19:09| In fact, one spring day in 1950, the house on Hollywood at 500, Mrs. Cozart was hanging her laundry up in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1149.0)|
| 0:19:18| When here comes a home run ball that lands in her laundry basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1158.0)|
| 0:19:21| So this gave us the idea, well, let's call this Home Run Alley to draw attention to how important baseball can be for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1161.0)|
| 0:19:29| And I've passed out some photographs from 1930 which show the ball field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1169.0)|
| 0:19:33| and a little bit of then McGee Tyson Airport before it moved in 1937 to the present location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1173.0)|
| 0:19:40| So it would honor us if you would pass this resolution and we can call it Home Run Alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1180.0)|
| 0:19:47| Welcome to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1187.0)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1191.0)|
| 0:19:53| Council Member Tesserman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1193.0)|
| 0:19:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1195.0)|
| 0:19:56| I would just like to, the fact that I literally drive this stretch multiple times a day and as well as it's in my district, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1196.0)|
| 0:20:04| I know the history and you're such a great steward of that, of the Pond Gap area and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1204.0)|
| 0:20:15| So thank you for that, but I would also like to please add my name in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1215.0)|
| 0:20:22| I'll make that addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1222.0)|
| 0:20:24| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1224.0)|
| 0:20:27| All right, hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1227.0)|
| 0:20:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1229.0)|
| 0:20:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1230.0)|
| 0:20:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1232.0)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1233.0)|
| 0:20:35| 11B is the resolution authorizing the mayor to amend the lease agreement with Tennessee Valley Agricultural and Industrial Fair Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1235.0)|

| 0:20:51| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1251.0)|
| 0:20:55| I'm wondering who can speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1255.0)|
| 0:21:01| It seems the renewal period is a shorter renewal period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1261.0)|
| 0:21:05| It's just a one-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1265.0)|
| 0:21:06| Can you tell us a little bit about why that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1266.0)|
| 0:21:09| Yeah, we've been negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1269.0)|
| 0:21:10| Actually, Executive Director Scott Solomski is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1270.0)|
| 0:21:13| It's good to see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1273.0)|
| 0:21:15| So we've been negotiating through law on a five-year renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1275.0)|
| 0:21:19| And then there was a request to have a meeting between some community members and Emerald and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1279.0)|
| 0:21:25| and the executive members and lawyers with the Tennessee Valley Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1285.0)|
| 0:21:31| excuse me, with the fair about some other opportunities on the parking lot that they use for the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1291.0)|
| 0:21:38| So we had discussions with the leadership for the fair about getting the one-year done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1298.0)|
| 0:21:44| while we continue to have discussions about that parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1304.0)|
| 0:21:47| because right now there are some other potential opportunities on that space in the future that people wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1307.0)|
| 0:21:58| And I'll just take this opportunity to remind staff, please remember to tell us your name when you go in to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1318.0)|

| 0:24:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1450.0)|
| 0:24:13| Mr. Brace, is this a question for you, or who's my point person on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1453.0)|
| 0:24:21| Well, I just noticed in the contract that there's no public meetings included as a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1461.0)|
| 0:24:30| of this contract, and so I wondered are there plans for there to be public review, comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1470.0)|
| 0:24:38| input, feedback on these designs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1478.0)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1481.0)|
| 0:24:42| Mr. Brace, Chief Operating Officer for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1482.0)|
| 0:24:45| This has been a longstanding pedestrian connection over a decade, the desire to provide controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1485.0)|
| 0:24:53| and safe access across this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1493.0)|
| 0:24:57| We are at the design phase of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1497.0)|
| 0:25:00| Yes, I would anticipate us having another update meeting south and including those designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1500.0)|
| 0:25:06| of how we plan and hope to get people across the bridge safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1506.0)|
| 0:25:10| Again, we don't necessarily have construction dollars, but this is the design phase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1510.0)|
| 0:25:14| is being paid for with city match dollars and a grant with some federal transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1514.0)|
| 0:25:19| money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1519.0)|
| 0:25:20| Mr. Clabo can correct any mistakes I've made, but we will be bringing the design out at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1520.0)|
| 0:25:25| some stage to get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1525.0)|
| 0:25:27| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1527.0)|
| 0:25:28| I do think it's really important to get that public feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1528.0)|
| 0:25:32| I've, you know, visited with community members and taken tours with Bike Walk Knoxville where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1532.0)|
| 0:25:38| they've pointed out projects where things could have been done a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1538.0)|
| 0:25:42| So if we can get that public feedback on the front end, it'll be a better project on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1542.0)|
| 0:25:48| other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1548.0)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1549.0)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1550.0)|

| 0:25:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1553.0)|
| 0:25:54| I think my question is for Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1554.0)|
| 0:25:57| I had asked some questions about the timeframes for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1557.0)|
| 0:26:02| Like, so we're in 2023 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1562.0)|
| 0:26:05| Like, where did this start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1565.0)|
| 0:26:07| What different points are we, have we passed and what were the times for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1567.0)|
| 0:26:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1572.0)|
| 0:26:13| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1573.0)|
| 0:26:14| Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1574.0)|
| 0:26:15| And to kind of co-answer here with Mr. Bryce, but this was a big part of the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1575.0)|
| 0:26:23| concept plan that was developed with a lot of community input and released in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1583.0)|
| 0:26:28| of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1588.0)|
| 0:26:30| So this particular funding is supported through a grant, which we applied for in 2019 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1590.0)|
| 0:26:36| were awarded in February of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1596.0)|
| 0:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:40| So this is now the first phase to actually spend that grant funding to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1600.0)|
| 0:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:45| So the grant funding that was improved in 2022 is now we're approving spending it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1605.0)|
| 0:26:50| the design part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1610.0)|
| 0:26:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1611.0)|
| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1612.0)|
| 0:26:53| But not for the actual changes, construction and modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1613.0)|
| 0:26:57| Do we have funding for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1617.0)|
| 0:27:00| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1620.0)|
| 0:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1621.0)|
| 0:27:02| We're still looking at funding in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1622.0)|
| 0:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1624.0)|
| 0:27:05| So, and again, the design and then we'll get some additional estimates that will be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1625.0)|
| 0:27:09| as we start to look at what those costs would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1629.0)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=1632.0)|

| 0:34:10| My question for LaKenya, have you told the police chief how he cannot participate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2050.0)|
| 0:34:13| the violence and yet still be a part of the orchestrating of removing violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2053.0)|
| 0:34:17| That doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2057.0)|
| 0:34:18| We have to pick a side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2058.0)|
| 0:34:19| Are we going to be against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2059.0)|
| 0:34:20| Are we with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2060.0)|
| 0:34:21| I cannot believe you all would give this police department any income after what they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2061.0)|
| 0:34:26| done to Lisa Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2066.0)|
| 0:34:27| But let's not forget Robert Bailey and Anthony Thompson Jr. and Anthony Thompson Jr.'s family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2067.0)|
| 0:34:32| and his sister as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2072.0)|

| 0:34:36| They do not care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2076.0)|
| 0:34:39| And that is why I have to run for office, because we have to highlight the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2079.0)|
| 0:34:42| We have to talk about the key players and the elder guard who is putting people against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2082.0)|

| 0:34:48| That's the kicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2088.0)|
| 0:34:49| She did what she was supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2089.0)|
| 0:34:50| And you all got Matthew Best and Tim Hill running for this girl's seat, because she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2090.0)|
| 0:34:54| actually doing her job, being a voice for the people, while the rubber stamp continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2094.0)|

| 0:35:01| We're telling people that we don't have health disparities in our community, telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2101.0)|
| 0:35:05| people that we don't have food desert in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2105.0)|
| 0:35:07| Yes, we do, Gwen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2107.0)|
| 0:35:08| We have several few food deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2108.0)|
| 0:35:10| That's why Rudy East has been created and elevating in the space that they're elevating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2110.0)|
| 0:35:14| in, because you, as our representative, won't do a damn thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:17| That is the problem, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2117.0)|
| 0:35:19| So again, 2023, Constance Everett is running for mayor of Knoxville for this very reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2119.0)|
| 0:35:25| because there is no way in hell I will give this police department a dime after what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2125.0)|
| 0:35:29| did to Lisa Edwards, Anthony Thompson Jr. and several other members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2129.0)|

| 0:35:35| Let me drop her name too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2135.0)|
| 0:35:36| Since y'all have amnesia, forget how much violence and abuse and brutality this police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2136.0)|
| 0:35:40| department has put in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2140.0)|
| 0:35:42| I can't wait to fire you, Paul Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2142.0)|

| 0:35:48| is fire your ass immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2148.0)|
| 0:35:49| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2149.0)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2155.0)|
| 0:35:56| Council Member Singh, did you turn off your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2156.0)|
| 0:35:58| Yeah, I thought, is there anyone else on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2158.0)|
| 0:36:01| Well, I just wanted to make sure I didn't miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2161.0)|
| 0:36:04| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2164.0)|
| 0:36:05| I just wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2165.0)|
| 0:36:08| Got distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2168.0)|
| 0:36:10| The real-time information center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2170.0)|
| 0:36:12| That's something that I fear about privacy and getting into people's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2172.0)|
| 0:36:18| I know that this isn't about the equipment or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2178.0)|
| 0:36:21| It's just about the building of it, but I'm not going to be voting in favor of this, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2181.0)|
| 0:36:27| because of my concerns on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2187.0)|
| 0:36:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2189.0)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2190.0)|
| 0:36:31| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2191.0)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2192.0)|
| 0:36:35| I have similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2195.0)|
| 0:36:38| This real-time crime center has come to us not for discussion in terms of how it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2198.0)|
| 0:36:44| operate and how it would be implemented into our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2204.0)|
| 0:36:48| Even talking to our officers, they have no idea who's going to staff this real-time crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2208.0)|
| 0:36:53| center while we have such a shortage of officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2213.0)|
| 0:36:59| We've had several items come before us dealing with the public safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2219.0)|
| 0:37:04| It seems the city does not want to bring before us the full cost of the public safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2224.0)|
| 0:37:12| but bring it to us in small increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2232.0)|
| 0:37:15| So, I'm not even able to determine how much we've spent on this real-time crime center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2235.0)|
| 0:37:25| thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2245.0)|
| 0:37:27| But as Council Member Singh pointed out, this does not even include the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2247.0)|
| 0:37:34| So, you know, once again, we're being expected to contribute a million here, a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2254.0)|
| 0:37:46| million here, until we get to a point where it's like, well, we don't want to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2266.0)|
| 0:37:50| real-time crime center and have it be empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2270.0)|
| 0:37:52| Well, we don't want to, instead of having the full conversation at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2272.0)|
| 0:37:58| We also, as I've pointed out before, we don't have policies in place that would put some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2278.0)|
| 0:38:04| guardrails in place regarding the equipment and the surveillance equipment that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2284.0)|
| 0:38:09| be used in a real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2289.0)|
| 0:38:12| And so, concerns about privacy are absolutely warranted at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2292.0)|
| 0:38:18| We've had measures come before us that would put cameras, essentially, in the area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2298.0)|
| 0:38:28| the majority of individuals experiencing homelessness are receiving services in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2308.0)|
| 0:38:39| It was presented to us as a response to the gun violence that we're experiencing in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2319.0)|
| 0:38:47| I remember at that meeting, Council Member McKenzie asked that they would be moved to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2327.0)|
| 0:38:52| Magnolia, but did it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2332.0)|
| 0:38:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2334.0)|
| 0:38:55| We're not having those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2335.0)|
| 0:38:58| I believe we need to have those conversations, not only to ensure that the rights of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2338.0)|
| 0:39:06| community members are being upheld, but that we are investing public dollars smartly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2346.0)|
| 0:39:14| And at this point, it doesn't feel like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2354.0)|
| 0:39:17| It seems like we are continuing to pour, pour, pour money in, and I'm not sure what the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2357.0)|
| 0:39:23| costs are going to be, or whether we are building out a real-time crime center that we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2363.0)|
| 0:39:29| afford to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2369.0)|
| 0:39:32| Is that an additional million just to staff it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2372.0)|
| 0:39:36| Another $10 million for the equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2376.0)|
| 0:39:39| We need an understanding of what the plans are for this building, for this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2379.0)|
| 0:39:45| What ask do you anticipate coming back with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2385.0)|
| 0:39:49| I'll ask that question now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2389.0)|
| 0:39:52| Chief Noel, if you can give us any sort of idea of what you anticipate will be additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2392.0)|
| 0:40:01| ask in order to get this real-time crime center up and operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2401.0)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2407.0)|
| 0:40:09| We put in a budget request for three non-sworn physicians, one supervisor, and two non-sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2409.0)|
| 0:40:18| operators who would be the initial staffing to operate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2418.0)|
| 0:40:23| You know, we could have a mix of having police officers and professional staff working in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2423.0)|
| 0:40:30| the real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2430.0)|
| 0:40:32| Ideally, it would be we need to have some non-sworn staffing in those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2432.0)|
| 0:40:41| Any idea about equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2441.0)|
| 0:40:46| Not at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2446.0)|
| 0:40:47| I mean, what the cost is going to be for the equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2447.0)|
| 0:40:49| I mean, any kind of plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2449.0)|
| 0:40:51| I mean, so our plan right now is to start off with 15, approximately 15 cameras that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2451.0)|
| 0:40:56| the city owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2456.0)|
| 0:40:57| Those cameras would be marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2457.0)|
| 0:40:59| They would have the city logo on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2459.0)|
| 0:41:01| They would be clearly visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2461.0)|
| 0:41:02| And we would work with communities to place cameras in the communities, one, that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2462.0)|
| 0:41:08| them, but also in areas that are experiencing a high amount of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2468.0)|
| 0:41:15| I've gone out and spoken to many members of the community that are eager to have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2475.0)|
| 0:41:19| cameras because they believe that's going to help keep their neighborhoods safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2479.0)|
| 0:41:27| And these cameras tend to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2487.0)|
| 0:41:29| I'm not going to ask how much you anticipate budgeting for it because we've had, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2489.0)|
| 0:41:34| the camera downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2494.0)|
| 0:41:37| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2497.0)|
| 0:41:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2499.0)|
| 0:41:40| Cameras run about $2,000 a piece, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2500.0)|
| 0:41:43| That's just back of the envelope calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2503.0)|
| 0:41:45| And we would also need, you know, the hardware and software as well to man those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2505.0)|
| 0:41:50| Once we buy that hardware and software, each additional camera would be an expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2510.0)|
| 0:41:54| But you're looking around, you know, approximately $2,000 per camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2514.0)|
| 0:41:58| Council Member Parker, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2518.0)|
| 0:42:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2521.0)|
| 0:42:02| I will wait and let others know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2522.0)|
| 0:42:04| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2524.0)|
| 0:42:05| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2525.0)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2527.0)|
| 0:42:08| Chief Noel has started answering the question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2528.0)|
| 0:42:12| Council Member Parker asked which was about the cost for the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2532.0)|
| 0:42:16| So we're estimating $2,000 a piece for the cameras, but that does not include the hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2536.0)|
| 0:42:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2542.0)|
| 0:42:23| Chief Powell, I don't know if you could speak to the hardware and software cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2543.0)|
| 0:42:26| I don't know if we've scoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2546.0)|
| 0:42:27| Have we scoped that out yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2547.0)|
| 0:42:30| It's Chief David Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2550.0)|
| 0:42:32| So the hardware cost can go from anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:35| We haven't scoped that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:37| We are starting, beginning the process to do demos for folks to come in and offer the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2557.0)|
| 0:42:43| the different software packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2563.0)|
| 0:42:45| There are as many as there are different car brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2565.0)|
| 0:42:48| There's all kinds of software out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2568.0)|
| 0:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2573.0)|
| 0:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2574.0)|
| 0:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2576.0)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2577.0)|
| 0:43:01| Deputy Mayor Brice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2581.0)|
| 0:43:02| Yeah, I just thank you very much, David Brice, COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2582.0)|
| 0:43:05| And I just want – so this is for the build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2585.0)|
| 0:43:08| There is FF&E that's included in the project, which is furniture and some technology and screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2588.0)|
| 0:43:16| So there are – I think the software would be a separate component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2596.0)|
| 0:43:21| but there is a significant amount of build-out that comes with this construction project as it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2601.0)|
| 0:43:27| Deputy Mayor Gill, was there also some work on the website, maybe with some information for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2607.0)|
| 0:43:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2614.0)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2615.0)|
| 0:43:36| So some of these questions, including the kind of concepts around cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2616.0)|
| 0:43:42| and how this relates to the work is available on an FAQ page that we have put on KnoxvilleTN.gov slash R-T-I-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2622.0)|
| 0:43:54| And you can find that currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2634.0)|
| 0:43:56| We will also be adding additional information to that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2636.0)|
| 0:43:59| As Chief Noel described, the scope gets further built out, and we have additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2639.0)|
| 0:44:04| I'll also mention to this body that should you decide to have a workshop on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2644.0)|
| 0:44:09| we are totally willing and would be glad to have that as a space for additional discussion for you, if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2649.0)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2655.0)|
| 0:44:16| And if I could add, you know, there's no secret on how we would use this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2656.0)|
| 0:44:20| I've spoken about it probably at least 50 times in a public forum, including today at the Downtown Rotary Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2660.0)|
| 0:44:25| You know, we went into detail on how we would use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2665.0)|
| 0:44:28| So even though we don't have the software, we're not running it yet, exceptionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2668.0)|
| 0:44:32| we have – you know, we know how we're going to use this and how this is going to help keep people in our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2672.0)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you, Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2678.0)|
| 0:44:40| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2680.0)|
| 0:44:44| I just wanted to follow up on what Ms. Gill said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2684.0)|
| 0:44:49| and reemphasize that I am in support of a workshop on the real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2689.0)|
| 0:44:56| That would include my surveillance ordinance that I really, really want to bring before City Council for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2696.0)|
| 0:45:03| So I echo the need for that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2703.0)|
| 0:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2707.0)|
| 0:45:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2708.0)|
| 0:45:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2710.0)|
| 0:45:11| Well, I mean, it's not even 7 o'clock yet, so I don't think we're in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2711.0)|
| 0:45:15| So, Chief Noel, would you like to tell – I feel like there's been a lot of conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2715.0)|
| 0:45:19| and there may be a lot of members of the public listening, that this might be the first time they've heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2719.0)|
| 0:45:23| So maybe you could tell us what you told us at Rotary Club today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2723.0)|
| 0:45:27| or talk a little bit more about what the real-time crime center will do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2727.0)|
| 0:45:30| what will these employees do that you just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2730.0)|
| 0:45:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2733.0)|
| 0:45:34| So there's two primary ways where a real-time crime center, a real-time information center operates in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2734.0)|
| 0:45:40| The first part is that the majority of this will be used will be after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2740.0)|
| 0:45:45| So when a crime occurs, if a crime either occurred in front of a camera, a city camera, or if –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2745.0)|
| 0:45:52| Including a body camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2752.0)|
| 0:45:54| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2754.0)|
| 0:45:55| Oh, the cameras that are outstationed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2755.0)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2757.0)|
| 0:45:58| So this is not connected –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2758.0)|
| 0:45:59| Nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2759.0)|
| 0:46:00| This is not connected to our body cameras or our in-car cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2760.0)|
| 0:46:04| Actually, and I'm glad you actually brought that up, I'm glad you asked that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2764.0)|
| 0:46:07| because if you go on that frequently asked question page we have on our website, we actually address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2767.0)|
| 0:46:13| So it does not tap into the body cameras or the real-time crime centers directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2773.0)|
| 0:46:17| but a camera that we would put on a pole, a real-time crime camera would be mounted on a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2777.0)|
| 0:46:23| It would have a city logo on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2783.0)|
| 0:46:25| It would be able to clearly see that it's a camera, and you could go look at Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2785.0)|
| 0:46:30| Chattanooga has these cameras, and they have the city of Chattanooga logo on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2790.0)|
| 0:46:34| If a crime happened in front of one of those cameras, or which happens more frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2794.0)|
| 0:46:38| is a crime doesn't happen in front of the camera, but the perpetrator, or the potential perpetrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2798.0)|
| 0:46:43| will pass in front of that camera and will give us information on who that perpetrator is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2803.0)|
| 0:46:49| So say, for example, someone shoots and kills someone, and they have a mask on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2809.0)|
| 0:46:54| but then they run down the street, take that mask off, and they pass in front of a camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2814.0)|
| 0:46:59| We now have an image of who that perpetrator is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2819.0)|
| 0:47:01| We have a shooting, and we believe the perpetrator is in a red Honda Civic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2821.0)|
| 0:47:06| and eight blocks away, right in the proximity to the crime scene, we get the picture of a real-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2826.0)|
| 0:47:12| we get the picture of that Honda Civic, and we get the license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2832.0)|
| 0:47:16| Well, that helps us as we put together and try to solve that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2836.0)|
| 0:47:20| Every investigation is like putting a puzzle together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2840.0)|
| 0:47:23| and it's just one additional piece to help us solve these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2843.0)|
| 0:47:27| What the staffing in the real-time information center will do would be if a call for service comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2847.0)|
| 0:47:33| so say someone is shot at Summit in Gay, and there's a red Honda Civic fleeing in a direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2853.0)|
| 0:47:40| what will happen is those operators will have our radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2860.0)|
| 0:47:44| and they will hear that call come out, and they can instantly start working with our officers in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2864.0)|
| 0:47:50| to give them information if they see anything on a camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2870.0)|
| 0:47:54| So even if something doesn't happen right in front of a camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2874.0)|
| 0:47:57| they'll start looking at the cameras closest to that intersection to see if they can provide any support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2877.0)|
| 0:48:04| to our police officers and give them information if they're responding to that scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2884.0)|
| 0:48:08| That happens a lot less frequently for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2888.0)|
| 0:48:11| It will be after the fact, but there are countless examples across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2891.0)|
| 0:48:16| of operators in a real-time information center being able to perform real-time support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2896.0)|
| 0:48:24| which will help in the apprehension of violent criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2904.0)|
| 0:48:27| How long has Chattanooga had theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2907.0)|
| 0:48:30| Don't quote me on a couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2910.0)|
| 0:48:33| Okay. Did you have one in New Orleans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2913.0)|
| 0:48:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2915.0)|
| 0:48:36| How long had you had one there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2916.0)|
| 0:48:38| Maybe seven years plus, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2918.0)|
| 0:48:43| Five to seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2923.0)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2927.0)|
| 0:48:48| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2928.0)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2931.0)|
| 0:48:52| I just had a follow-up question based on that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2932.0)|
| 0:48:56| One thing you mentioned is the cameras will allow you to identify a suspect if their face appears on the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2936.0)|
| 0:49:05| Can you tell us more about how you would be able to identify individuals through that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2945.0)|
| 0:49:13| Well, if someone passes in front of a camera, like on foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2953.0)|
| 0:49:18| we would have a picture of them that we could then put on the news or show to a potential witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2958.0)|
| 0:49:24| It would give us more information than we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2964.0)|
| 0:49:27| Say, for example, we have a witness that says a person committed a murder wearing a blue T-shirt and green pants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2967.0)|
| 0:49:37| but they had a mask on or they did not see their face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2977.0)|
| 0:49:40| and then literally moments after we have them passing in front of a camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2980.0)|
| 0:49:45| and we have a be able to get a still shot of that person's face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2985.0)|
| 0:49:50| That's one additional piece of the puzzle to help us identify who that individual would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2990.0)|
| 0:49:57| Some of the concerns with this technology have been that, you know, for a license plate reader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=2997.0)|
| 0:50:04| the video has improved to the point where you can capture a license plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3004.0)|
| 0:50:11| but facial details are still not something that we can really capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3011.0)|
| 0:50:18| We've even had instances in Knoxville where we've seen gun violence happen directly underneath a KCDC camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3018.0)|
| 0:50:32| and we haven't been able to pull any details from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3032.0)|
| 0:50:36| In your research, have you found any evidence that the technology of the cameras you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3036.0)|
| 0:50:45| has improved more than the ones KCDC is using so that you would actually be able to pull some information from that video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3045.0)|
| 0:50:53| So, I mean, there's a million different variables, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3053.0)|
| 0:50:55| So, you know, sometimes when someone passes in front of a camera, you get a good picture of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3055.0)|
| 0:50:59| Sometimes you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3059.0)|
| 0:51:01| You know, all cameras are not created equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3061.0)|
| 0:51:03| You know, some cameras are high quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3063.0)|
| 0:51:05| Some cameras have lesser quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3065.0)|
| 0:51:07| Some cameras do a better job at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3067.0)|
| 0:51:09| Some cameras don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3069.0)|
| 0:51:11| Obviously, you know, you watch the news every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3071.0)|
| 0:51:13| You will see surveillance video of police departments, not just Knoxville, police officers in the surrounding area saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3073.0)|
| 0:51:19| have you seen this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3079.0)|
| 0:51:21| Sometimes the quality is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3081.0)|
| 0:51:22| Sometimes the quality is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3082.0)|
| 0:51:24| But it's still the best evidence we have, and we put that out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3084.0)|
| 0:51:27| If you know who this person is, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3087.0)|
| 0:51:30| Just because someone calls up and says that's John Doe on that picture does not mean that it's actually that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3090.0)|
| 0:51:35| It's just an investigative lead that we still have to continue to work and see if that person is potentially the perpetrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3095.0)|
| 0:51:43| I'm not going to sit up here and tell you that every camera we get is going to get a perfect picture of someone every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3103.0)|
| 0:51:48| But I can tell you that it is 100% help us clear cases and identify who individuals are and aid us in keeping our city safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3108.0)|
| 0:51:59| Two final points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3119.0)|
| 0:52:02| One is I'm surprised about the price that you quoted because I believe I read recently that it was about $26,000 for Chattanooga to replace a camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3122.0)|
| 0:52:13| So my thinking of the cost of cameras is a lot higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3133.0)|
| 0:52:17| And then the other thing is I appreciate what you're sharing about needing further investigation when you capture that image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3137.0)|
| 0:52:28| because where this technology has caused problems in other cities is if you take that image and try to run it through a database to figure out who that person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3148.0)|
| 0:52:38| and then you take action based upon what you find from that database and then we have warrants being served to the wrong location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3158.0)|
| 0:52:50| and individuals being arrested who should not have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3170.0)|
| 0:52:54| And those are some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3174.0)|
| 0:52:56| Of course, this technology does not work well for women's faces, people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3176.0)|
| 0:53:03| And so these are the individuals who tend to be incorrectly identified using this technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3183.0)|
| 0:53:10| Well, that's just bad police work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3190.0)|
| 0:53:11| I mean, we put pictures out every day when someone calls up and says, you know, I believe that's John Doe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3191.0)|
| 0:53:16| You know, we don't discount that and we don't go get an arrest warrant based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3196.0)|
| 0:53:20| That is just another piece of the puzzle and we have to continue to investigate and use that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3200.0)|
| 0:53:27| That information could potentially help us establish probable cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3207.0)|
| 0:53:32| but there is no way that just someone calling up or any database or anything else saying that is the person on that image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3212.0)|
| 0:53:39| and then us just moving forward and getting an arrest warrant, there's no way that that is enough to beat the threshold of probable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3219.0)|
| 0:53:45| It's just another tool in our tool belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3225.0)|
| 0:53:47| And it's another thing to help us to potentially identify potential perpetrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3227.0)|
| 0:53:53| And my time is up, so I hope that you will support an effort to put that position in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3233.0)|
| 0:53:59| I think we need it in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3239.0)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3241.0)|
| 0:54:02| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3242.0)|
| 0:54:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3244.0)|
| 0:54:06| And so I just want to put out there that there is actually a series called Real Time Crime where it shows actual cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3246.0)|
| 0:54:12| I know that there's, I think they're in the second episode of how surveillance cameras have helped to solve crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3252.0)|
| 0:54:18| so that might be a good point of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3258.0)|
| 0:54:20| What I will say is I'm surprised, as Council Member Parker said, at the cost of each camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3260.0)|
| 0:54:26| What I would say is that if we're going to do this and we're going to invest in this as a mechanism to help prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3266.0)|
| 0:54:31| and also solve crime is that we get a higher quality of camera, no disrespect to KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3271.0)|
| 0:54:39| but we know in the past that there have been incidents that have happened right under cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3279.0)|
| 0:54:44| and it was so grainy that there was nothing that we could use as evidence in those particular homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3284.0)|
| 0:54:51| So I would encourage us, and I know that you guys will look and see what's the best technology that's out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3291.0)|
| 0:54:56| but if this is an investment that we're going to make, I would hope that we're going to get a higher quality of technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3296.0)|
| 0:55:03| where it will be able to help us identify not just perpetrators, vehicles and tags, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3303.0)|
| 0:55:12| I really appreciate those remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3312.0)|
| 0:55:13| So one thing, when I talk publicly about people getting cameras for their own home or business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3313.0)|
| 0:55:19| the thing I always say is there's nothing worse than a cheap camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3319.0)|
| 0:55:22| because we've all seen that picture of Bigfoot and you get nothing worse than us saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3322.0)|
| 0:55:29| yeah, we caught the perpetrator on camera and then you get that blurry looking Bigfoot picture that we really can't do much with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3329.0)|
| 0:55:35| And sometimes on the news you do see that where it looks like it's like a blur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3335.0)|
| 0:55:38| So the cheap cameras will do a decent job during the day, but at night or in low light they perform very, very poorly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3338.0)|
| 0:55:46| So the cameras that we will invest in would be the highest quality camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3346.0)|
| 0:55:52| that would give us high resolution images at night and during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3352.0)|
| 0:55:57| The cameras that they have in New Orleans, and again, we've not scoped out what camera system we're going to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3357.0)|
| 0:56:02| or what software or hardware, they could read a police officer's name tag from a block away at night on Bourbon Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3362.0)|
| 0:56:08| And I've personally seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3368.0)|
| 0:56:10| And it certainly does not mean that in every scenario a block away you're going to be able to get a perfect image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3370.0)|
| 0:56:19| Someone wearing a baseball cap or someone's in shadows or someone's moving really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3379.0)|
| 0:56:24| cameras are not perfect, but the technology out there is very, very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3384.0)|
| 0:56:29| And if you could read a name tag like I have here at a block away, that's pretty impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3389.0)|
| 0:56:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3394.0)|
| 0:56:35| And so my point of reference is when we have a group of 100 or more people on an incident that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3395.0)|
| 0:56:44| and everyone was right under a camera and you could not identify anyone in that particular crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3404.0)|
| 0:56:50| and no one was able to see who the shooters were or came forward with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3410.0)|
| 0:56:55| So this is why it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3415.0)|
| 0:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3418.0)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3419.0)|
| 0:57:00| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3420.0)|
| 0:57:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3421.0)|
| 0:57:03| Chief Noel, I know that we ask a lot of the police department, right, we want you to solve the crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3423.0)|
| 0:57:07| and everything that you described I completely support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3427.0)|
| 0:57:11| We do need more puzzle pieces to figure out where harm is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3431.0)|
| 0:57:17| Where I'm coming from is a place of fear of what will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3437.0)|
| 0:57:24| you and I have spoken about the cameras, the doorbell cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3444.0)|
| 0:57:29| and that they are willing to send to the police departments that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3449.0)|
| 0:57:33| I know they have not offered that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3453.0)|
| 0:57:36| So my concerns are about technology being used for good or sliding into something that's more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3456.0)|
| 0:57:46| And I would want to be reassured that before we move any further with the real-time center, once it's up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3466.0)|
| 0:57:55| that we don't get further and further into more invasive technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3475.0)|
| 0:58:02| So I'm sure these conversations will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3482.0)|
| 0:58:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3485.0)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3487.0)|
| 0:58:08| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3488.0)|
| 0:58:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3489.0)|
| 0:58:10| Chief, I think a lot of the concerns are just from not knowing what the expertise that you have or what's planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3490.0)|
| 0:58:20| When will the operating procedures for this be ready, written, documented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3500.0)|
| 0:58:29| Once we build out, we get the hardware and software and we see what our staffing is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3509.0)|
| 0:58:34| it would be premature to build out operating procedures not knowing what hardware we're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3514.0)|
| 0:58:39| the capabilities of that hardware, the capabilities of the software, the cameras that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3519.0)|
| 0:58:43| and who's going to be staffing and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3523.0)|
| 0:58:45| Once we get that scoped out, then we're going to sit down and look what Chattanooga is doing, New Orleans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3525.0)|
| 0:58:51| Tulsa, and some of those other places, and build out specific standard operating procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3531.0)|
| 0:58:58| The concerns that you all have addressed in here are, you know, we're not going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3538.0)|
| 0:59:05| have in our policy that an image on a camera alone cannot be used for probable cause, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3545.0)|
| 0:59:12| You're going to need some other investigative step to determine who that individual is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3552.0)|
| 0:59:16| That's just good police work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3556.0)|
| 0:59:18| I mean, it wouldn't meet the probable cause threshold anyway to make an arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3558.0)|
| 0:59:22| but it would be premature for us right now to build out standard operating procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3562.0)|
| 0:59:27| when we don't even know what the capability of the hardware and software that we have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3567.0)|
| 0:59:31| We're just not at that point yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3571.0)|
| 0:59:32| We're just at that point now where once we get this built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3572.0)|
| 0:59:35| then we're going to start sitting down with potential vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3575.0)|
| 0:59:38| and look at the capability of the different platforms out there and see which one we're going to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3578.0)|
| 0:59:43| So there will be standard operating procedures as there are for any other procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3583.0)|
| 0:59:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3587.0)|
| 0:59:48| There's going to be policies and procedures that will govern exactly how this information can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3588.0)|
| 0:59:52| and who can access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3592.0)|
| 0:59:54| I'll just add, you know, next time you download an app on your phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3594.0)|
| 0:59:58| read the fine print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3598.0)|
| 1:00:00| And, you know, you basically, when you download these apps and you give people permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3600.0)|
| 1:00:04| you let them in to look at pretty much everything you have on this phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3604.0)|
| 1:00:07| And, you know, we're in an information age where there is so much information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3607.0)|
| 1:00:14| The limited information that we're going to have in a real-time crime center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3614.0)|
| 1:00:17| pales in comparison to everything else that's already out there in the public domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3617.0)|
| 1:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3621.0)|
| 1:00:22| So the procedures will be contingent upon the technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3622.0)|
| 1:00:24| and when the technology is purchased, then the procedures will be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3624.0)|
| 1:00:27| Before we go live, we will have standard operating procedures and policies built around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3627.0)|
| 1:00:32| Right now, you know, part of the 21cp contract that you all approved today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3632.0)|
| 1:00:38| we are taking the existing general orders that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3638.0)|
| 1:00:43| and converting them into a KPD policy manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3643.0)|
| 1:00:47| And that's going to be a process that 21cp is going to help us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3647.0)|
| 1:00:51| Once that is completed or as we get those policies done in batches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3651.0)|
| 1:00:55| we're going to be putting them up on our website for everyone to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3655.0)|
| 1:00:59| And the same thing for the policy around the real-time information center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3659.0)|
| 1:01:04| We'll be live on our website for everyone to see before we start using this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3664.0)|
| 1:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3670.0)|
| 1:01:11| And I'll be happy to share that policy with the council as well before we go live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3671.0)|
| 1:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3674.0)|
| 1:01:16| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3676.0)|
| 1:01:17| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3677.0)|
| 1:01:19| Yeah, Chief Noel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3679.0)|
| 1:01:20| so what is the time frame, do you think, for staffing an operation and having policies ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3680.0)|
| 1:01:27| You know, right now, you know, we have a tentative start date of the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3687.0)|
| 1:01:31| But depending upon, you know, like this is very fluid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3691.0)|
| 1:01:35| Obviously, if we don't have any employees or if we don't have any hardware or software installed yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3695.0)|
| 1:01:39| we won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3699.0)|
| 1:01:40| But, you know, tentatively we're looking at the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3700.0)|
| 1:01:43| But I would probably say that's a pretty ambitious timeline right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3703.0)|
| 1:01:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3707.0)|
| 1:01:48| With regards to us, if we schedule a different meeting to have further discussion about policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3708.0)|
| 1:01:54| Chief Powell, do you have anything to add on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3714.0)|
| 1:02:01| And I keep picking on Chief Powell, but, you know, Chief Powell is the lead on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3721.0)|
| 1:02:05| So, Deputy Chief Powell, and again, I wish I had more answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3725.0)|
| 1:02:09| This is the first real-time crime center I've stood up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3729.0)|
| 1:02:11| so I'm kind of scratching and itching along here by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3731.0)|
| 1:02:17| 21CP, they will help us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3737.0)|
| 1:02:20| I don't want to get the horse before the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3740.0)|
| 1:02:22| Again, we're looking at demo on different software packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3742.0)|
| 1:02:27| Once we get through the pass today and once we see that the construction has started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3747.0)|
| 1:02:33| then we'll start looking at software packages, the camera packages, see where we are money-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3753.0)|
| 1:02:38| And then at that time, I'll move on to the next phase while my folks are helping me get in the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3758.0)|
| 1:02:45| Then we'll start looking at policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3765.0)|
| 1:02:47| In this process, we already have built strong relationships with Chattanooga, Tulsa, Oklahoma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3767.0)|
| 1:02:53| and New Orleans real-time crime center as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3773.0)|
| 1:02:57| So I'm talking with them through this process, taking, borrowing policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3777.0)|
| 1:03:02| I like Tulsa's policy on one part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3782.0)|
| 1:03:04| I like Chattanooga's policy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3784.0)|
| 1:03:06| So we'll take all of those policies together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3786.0)|
| 1:03:09| We'll put them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3789.0)|
| 1:03:11| Then we'll get with 21CP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3791.0)|
| 1:03:14| Again, let them look over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3794.0)|
| 1:03:15| They've got a national idea of what policy should look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3795.0)|
| 1:03:19| and then we'll whittle out from the big bag of pulled policies from all across the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3799.0)|
| 1:03:24| and come up with our own policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3804.0)|
| 1:03:26| Okay, so looking up Chattanooga, they also have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3806.0)|
| 1:03:31| It says they access 3,000 cameras across Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3811.0)|
| 1:03:34| Fifty-three are owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3814.0)|
| 1:03:36| So they're tapping into cameras that don't belong to the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3816.0)|
| 1:03:40| Is that our intent on the long frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3820.0)|
| 1:03:44| Well, that's our intent, but first we've got to establish those MOUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3824.0)|
| 1:03:47| We would like to have MOUs with KCDC, UT, PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3827.0)|
| 1:03:51| whoever would give that with us to work in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3831.0)|
| 1:03:54| Chattanooga started out with very few cameras, but when they first came online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3834.0)|
| 1:03:59| they had MOUs with these different agencies to tap into their cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3839.0)|
| 1:04:04| and to use it to eliminate the real-time crime center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3844.0)|
| 1:04:07| Okay, and then in doing the math from the news articles for the cameras that they purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3847.0)|
| 1:04:12| in the beginning and later, their cameras, including the 2022 purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3852.0)|
| 1:04:18| were between $15,000 and some change to $16,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3858.0)|
| 1:04:22| So they were between $15,000 and $17,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3862.0)|
| 1:04:25| They just had to replace 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3865.0)|
| 1:04:27| Well, they had to replace six cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3867.0)|
| 1:04:29| They just bought 11 more because they had a shooting where there were three people dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3869.0)|
| 1:04:35| and 14 others shot, and it turned out the camera was inoperable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3875.0)|
| 1:04:39| And they found that they had six inoperable cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3879.0)|
| 1:04:42| So I hope as part of our policies, if we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3882.0)|
| 1:04:46| that there's some monitoring maintenance of are the cameras actually functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3886.0)|
| 1:04:52| Yes, ma'am, that will definitely be the part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3892.0)|
| 1:04:54| So New Orleans, they have their own crew that goes out and takes care of the cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3894.0)|
| 1:05:00| rather than hiring it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3900.0)|
| 1:05:02| The city has city services that could help assist with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3902.0)|
| 1:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3906.0)|
| 1:05:07| But that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3907.0)|
| 1:05:08| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3908.0)|
| 1:05:09| And one thing we would have in a software package is a software package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3909.0)|
| 1:05:12| that will actually alert you if a camera goes offline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3912.0)|
| 1:05:15| And, you know, as far as accessing cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3915.0)|
| 1:05:19| those are cameras that people would voluntarily give us access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3919.0)|
| 1:05:23| There's no way that we would have the ability to tap into a camera against someone's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3923.0)|
| 1:05:30| If a business or an entity wanted to allow us to be able to access those cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3930.0)|
| 1:05:35| with the right software package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3935.0)|
| 1:05:37| then we would be able to feed that information into the real-time information center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3937.0)|
| 1:05:43| But I also would like to clarify that those cameras are not going to be monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3943.0)|
| 1:05:48| You're not going to have someone sitting there monitoring those cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3948.0)|
| 1:05:51| That would be something that if an incident does occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3951.0)|
| 1:05:53| then we would pull it up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3953.0)|
| 1:05:55| The non-city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3955.0)|
| 1:05:56| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3956.0)|
| 1:05:57| Well, even really the city ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3957.0)|
| 1:05:58| The city cameras, you know, you could have somebody staring there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3958.0)|
| 1:06:01| looking at each one of those cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3961.0)|
| 1:06:03| That's not the way these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3963.0)|
| 1:06:05| If a call for service comes out or if an incident happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3965.0)|
| 1:06:07| then you would either look at that real-time or go back in time and look to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3967.0)|
| 1:06:12| But it's a little misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3972.0)|
| 1:06:14| It's not like each one of these cameras has someone sitting there looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3974.0)|
| 1:06:17| Even when you see that camera wall, the video wall with all of these images up on a display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3977.0)|
| 1:06:24| no one is sitting there monitoring all of those cameras around the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3984.0)|
| 1:06:32| Deputy Mayor Brace, you're trying to bring us full circle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3992.0)|
| 1:06:37| We've had a lot of really good discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3997.0)|
| 1:06:39| but this agenda item, just for confirmation, is about building a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=3999.0)|
| 1:06:44| It's not about cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4004.0)|
| 1:06:46| It's not about – we've talked about a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4006.0)|
| 1:06:49| but can you just bring us back to what this is actually discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4009.0)|
| 1:06:52| Absolutely, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4012.0)|
| 1:06:53| This is about the construction of the facility, the real-time information center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4013.0)|
| 1:06:59| at the public safety complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4019.0)|
| 1:07:02| This was funded later after that original project had started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4022.0)|
| 1:07:05| so that's why you're seeing it as an amendment now to Mester's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4025.0)|
| 1:07:09| And so this is for the build-out, the sheetrock, the outlets, the desks, the conference rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4029.0)|
| 1:07:15| and those types of controlled access, the doors into the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4035.0)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4039.0)|
| 1:07:22| All right, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4042.0)|
| 1:07:24| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4044.0)|
| 1:07:26| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4046.0)|

| 1:07:55| Vice Mayor, I'd like to make a motion to suspend our council rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4075.0)|
| 1:08:00| to allow those who have signed up to speak on this agenda item to speak during public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4080.0)|

| 1:08:15| but we don't have a second, so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4095.0)|
| 1:08:18| Right now I have a separate motion just to suspend our rules to add someone to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4098.0)|
| 1:08:26| Do I have a second for that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4106.0)|

| 1:09:26| I've got a motion, I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4166.0)|
| 1:09:28| We've got several folks who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4168.0)|
| 1:09:31| As you know, our rules allow for five speakers, no, three speakers on each side, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4171.0)|
| 1:09:38| but we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4178.0)|
| 1:09:53| We have three in support and six in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4193.0)|
| 1:10:01| So do we want to entertain any motions to suspend the rules to allow all to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4201.0)|
| 1:10:06| or do you want to keep our rules to three and three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4206.0)|
| 1:10:12| Sorry, Vice Mayor, could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4212.0)|
| 1:10:14| We have more people signed up to speak against it than our rules permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4214.0)|
| 1:10:19| So there's a motion to suspend the rules to allow everyone to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4219.0)|
| 1:10:24| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4224.0)|
| 1:10:25| I'll try to be consistent, but I only think it's fair and equitable for us to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4225.0)|
| 1:10:30| if there are equal number of people in excess of our three for each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4230.0)|
| 1:10:35| I don't think it's fair to allow for ten of one and three of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4235.0)|
| 1:10:39| So I'll be either abstaining or opposing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4239.0)|
| 1:10:42| I don't have a second on that motion, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4242.0)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4244.0)|
| 1:10:46| On which motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4246.0)|
| 1:10:48| The motion to suspend the rules to allow others to speak who are in excess of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4248.0)|
| 1:10:53| I'd like to amend that motion to say I would like to hear from everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4253.0)|
| 1:10:57| but perhaps at three minutes instead of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4257.0)|
| 1:11:00| I'd like everyone to have a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4260.0)|
| 1:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4262.0)|
| 1:11:03| Now I've got a motion to allow everyone to speak, but they speak for three minutes instead of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4263.0)|
| 1:11:10| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4270.0)|
| 1:11:11| I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4271.0)|
| 1:11:13| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4273.0)|
| 1:11:16| Well, I would just like to say that I'm in favor of it because this is not an issue where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4276.0)|
| 1:11:25| Council Member Harker, can you bring your mic down? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4285.0)|
| 1:11:27| This is not an issue where we're sitting in a quasi-judicial setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4287.0)|
| 1:11:32| This is an issue that's going to impact, you know, multiple community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4292.0)|
| 1:11:38| and I would like to hear from all the community members who want to share how they will be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4298.0)|
| 1:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4305.0)|
| 1:11:46| So the motion is, just for clarity, is to allow all the speakers to speak, but they would speak for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4306.0)|
| 1:11:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4313.0)|
| 1:11:55| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4315.0)|
| 1:11:56| That still would be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4316.0)|
| 1:11:57| I don't even know how many are on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4317.0)|
| 1:11:59| I know there are three on one side, and I think the intent, and whoever made the motion can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4319.0)|
| 1:12:06| those three people get their traditional five minutes each, and the people on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4326.0)|
| 1:12:12| whichever side that is, it gets there reduced where it would total 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4332.0)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4340.0)|
| 1:12:21| That is actually what I was intending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4341.0)|
| 1:12:24| As Councilmember Smith mentioned, we need to be, even though I agree with Councilmember Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4344.0)|
| 1:12:29| this is not a quasi-judicial, you still need to have some fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4349.0)|
| 1:12:34| Will I take back my second, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4354.0)|
| 1:12:39| So the motion is, just to make sure I'm clear, that there's 15 minutes total for each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4359.0)|
| 1:12:44| Is that what you're suggesting, Councilwoman, saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4364.0)|
| 1:12:47| Yeah, I guess that's how it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4367.0)|
| 1:12:49| Six to three minutes, yeah, 18 minutes, 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4369.0)|
| 1:12:53| And the second was retracted, so I don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4373.0)|
| 1:12:58| Is that an amended motion from Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4378.0)|
| 1:13:02| I don't know who made the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4382.0)|
| 1:13:03| She amended her motion, and it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4383.0)|
| 1:13:07| The second was withdrawn, so I don't have a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4387.0)|
| 1:13:10| We're seconding equal time, 15 minutes per side, if I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4390.0)|
| 1:13:15| Is that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4395.0)|
| 1:13:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4396.0)|
| 1:13:17| All right, so we now have a motion that each side will get 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4397.0)|
| 1:13:21| to divide between the number of speakers who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4401.0)|
| 1:13:25| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4405.0)|
| 1:13:28| Councilmember Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4408.0)|
| 1:13:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4410.0)|
| 1:13:31| I appreciate what we're trying to do, but I think the purpose of the standing rules of Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4411.0)|
| 1:13:38| is number of speakers, not number of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4418.0)|
| 1:13:42| So I'm just pointing that out, that I appreciate the sympathy of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4422.0)|
| 1:13:47| but I imagine Council's standing rules are written so that three people speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4427.0)|
| 1:13:53| three people speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4433.0)|
| 1:13:56| That's typically parliamentary procedure, so it's not that I don't want to hear from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4436.0)|
| 1:14:03| I just worry every time we keep suspending our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4443.0)|
| 1:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4447.0)|
| 1:14:08| Councilmember Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4448.0)|
| 1:14:09| Yeah, I just was going to say on the vein, I see it as suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4449.0)|
| 1:14:15| I know that's not what our rules are, which we can have a discussion about that another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4455.0)|
| 1:14:21| That is how it's done at Planning Commission, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4461.0)|
| 1:14:23| It's five minutes per side, is that correct, Mr. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4463.0)|
| 1:14:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4466.0)|
| 1:14:27| Okay, and it's not about numbers of speakers, it's about time per side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4467.0)|
| 1:14:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4471.0)|
| 1:14:32| Okay, thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4472.0)|
| 1:14:33| So that was the basis of me seconding that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4473.0)|
| 1:14:38| Okay, so to be clear, the motion is there will be the three speakers who are speaking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4478.0)|
| 1:14:47| would get five minutes each for a total of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4487.0)|
| 1:14:51| The speakers against, who number in six, would be given two and a half minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4491.0)|
| 1:14:58| So everyone clear on what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4498.0)|
| 1:15:01| Okay, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4501.0)|
| 1:15:02| Hearing none, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4502.0)|
| 1:15:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4504.0)|
| 1:15:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4505.0)|
| 1:15:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4506.0)|
| 1:15:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4507.0)|
| 1:15:08| All right, we have passed eight to one, so we'll allow everyone to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4508.0)|
| 1:15:14| So we'll start with the folks that have signed up to speak for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4514.0)|
| 1:15:22| Mr. Will Bowen is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4522.0)|
| 1:15:29| I just want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4529.0)|
| 1:15:32| The speakers for, including this gentleman, get five minutes each, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4532.0)|
| 1:15:39| The motion was that each side will get 15 minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4539.0)|
| 1:15:43| So the speakers for will get five minutes, because that will allow for 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4543.0)|
| 1:15:49| Speakers against, who number more, will get two and a half minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4549.0)|
| 1:15:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4554.0)|
| 1:15:55| Mr. Will Bowen, can you please give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4555.0)|
| 1:15:59| My name is Will Bowen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4559.0)|
| 1:16:00| My address is 5669 Eagle Crest Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4560.0)|
| 1:16:05| I live about two-thirds of a mile away from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4565.0)|
| 1:16:13| I'm strongly supportive of this, because when it comes down to it, we need more housing, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4573.0)|
| 1:16:22| And here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4582.0)|
| 1:16:25| The NIMBY problem that we have in America is out of control, and not building housing is not fixing our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4585.0)|
| 1:16:36| So that seems to be a common theme among some people, that they just are so resistant to change that they can't see that this is something that's really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4596.0)|
| 1:16:47| So there's an article in WBIR on August 15th of 2022, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4607.0)|
| 1:16:54| 99% of rentable units in the city of Knoxville were occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4614.0)|
| 1:17:00| This was in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4620.0)|
| 1:17:01| So before UT was in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4621.0)|
| 1:17:04| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4624.0)|
| 1:17:06| Now, we've had problems with, I don't want to just focus on UT students, but their sizable portion of our population during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4626.0)|
| 1:17:16| UT rented out the Holiday Inn on paper mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4636.0)|
| 1:17:21| And there's students that want to come to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4641.0)|
| 1:17:25| UT is a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4645.0)|
| 1:17:26| I go to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4646.0)|
| 1:17:27| It's a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4647.0)|
| 1:17:28| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4648.0)|
| 1:17:29| But people feel like they can't come here because they have nowhere to live, because the dorms are full, and there's no housing available that's affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4649.0)|
| 1:17:42| And it's supply and demand, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4662.0)|
| 1:17:47| You have more supply with high demand, and the prices will naturally flatten out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4667.0)|
| 1:17:53| And that's what we need to help this housing situation out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4673.0)|
| 1:17:58| And regardless if it's, you know, regardless of where it is, the concerns that I heard about what kind of people this is going to bring to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4678.0)|
| 1:18:10| Once again, I live less than a mile from this, from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4690.0)|
| 1:18:15| I have zero concerns about the kind of people that are coming because, frankly, that's a classist remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4695.0)|
| 1:18:24| Because you're scared of other people that are different from you, and that's not an American ideal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4704.0)|
| 1:18:30| Or it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4710.0)|
| 1:18:33| I just don't understand why people are so scared of change that they don't want something that will help, you know, lessen to an extent the housing issue in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4713.0)|
| 1:18:50| And let's go back to a couple years ago with the Flanagan apartment complex off of Maryville Pike in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4730.0)|
| 1:18:59| There was vehement opposition to that from the community, from city council, and it was – I believe it was a closely divided vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4739.0)|
| 1:19:08| I'm not sure. I don't remember the specific numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4748.0)|
| 1:19:14| But that's been, you know, a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4754.0)|
| 1:19:19| What have we heard about Flanagan Apartments since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4759.0)|
| 1:19:22| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4762.0)|
| 1:19:24| Which means what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4764.0)|
| 1:19:26| If you don't hear anything from somewhere, it has to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4766.0)|
| 1:19:30| It has to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4770.0)|
| 1:19:33| Because the people who were against this are going to be all up in arms every time something happens, and we haven't heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4773.0)|
| 1:19:40| Every time somebody has been against something and it actually gets built, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4780.0)|
| 1:19:46| So here's the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4786.0)|
| 1:19:53| We need more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4793.0)|
| 1:19:56| We're going to build it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4796.0)|
| 1:19:58| Hopefully. I hope we're going to build it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4798.0)|
| 1:20:00| The opposition to this is based in – it's not based in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4800.0)|
| 1:20:09| So, you know, it's – I don't understand why there's so much opposition to this when we complain about high prices everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4809.0)|
| 1:20:20| Well, not building more housing is not going to fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4820.0)|
| 1:20:24| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4824.0)|
| 1:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4826.0)|
| 1:20:28| Next up is Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4828.0)|
| 1:20:33| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4833.0)|
| 1:20:36| Hi, I'm Drew Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4836.0)|
| 1:20:37| My address is 4318 Washington Pike, number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4837.0)|
| 1:20:45| So I am here – this is my first time speaking for a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4845.0)|
| 1:20:48| I'm here to speak in support of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4848.0)|
| 1:20:51| I am a small-scale incremental developer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4851.0)|
| 1:20:55| I am not rich or a millionaire or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4855.0)|
| 1:20:58| I have no personal connection to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4858.0)|
| 1:21:01| And I'm also one of those hypothetical people that moved to Knoxville for college and stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4861.0)|
| 1:21:08| And part of the reason I stayed was I bought a house and I decided to build my life here and my career here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4868.0)|
| 1:21:15| And that house is now worth – it's increased in value about six-fold from when I bought it nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4875.0)|
| 1:21:23| It's about 600%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4883.0)|
| 1:21:25| And that's a pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4885.0)|
| 1:21:27| And whether or not your case is as extreme, the same thing has happened to anybody that owns property in Knox County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4887.0)|
| 1:21:35| Our values are double, triple, and we're constraining housing supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4895.0)|
| 1:21:41| About three years ago, being a pandemic, I saved a historic fourplex from demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4901.0)|
| 1:21:46| I had to go through the rezoning process as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4906.0)|
| 1:21:49| A lot of you were part of that, helped me through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4909.0)|
| 1:21:52| I was very naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4912.0)|
| 1:21:53| I didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4913.0)|
| 1:21:54| I went from RN2 to RN4, and that was just to return it to what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4914.0)|
| 1:21:59| It was an abandoned structure that was going to get torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4919.0)|
| 1:22:02| Now seven people live there where there would have been nobody living there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4922.0)|
| 1:22:09| So that led me to learn a lot about housing policy and related things like transportation and street design and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4929.0)|
| 1:22:21| I think that land use is at the foundation of making any policy changes in areas of concern that most of us in this room care about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4941.0)|
| 1:22:33| Whether that's mental health or climate, environment, or transportation, education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4953.0)|
| 1:22:40| But I think land use reform will help with all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4960.0)|
| 1:22:43| But I'd like to use my time to focus on one that is maybe not looked at as much, which is taxation, specifically taxation inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4963.0)|
| 1:22:53| So we know that our property taxes are not based on land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4973.0)|
| 1:22:57| That's what the rezoning is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4977.0)|
| 1:22:59| Please keep your remarks to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4979.0)|
| 1:23:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4982.0)|
| 1:23:03| So we're rezoning from proposed rezoning from agriculture to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4983.0)|
| 1:23:12| If homes were built on that land, right, they would pay more taxes than the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4992.0)|
| 1:23:18| And I guess I'll skip ahead a couple points in that smaller lots with more houses proportionately pay more taxes than agricultural land or large tract suburban land, which is what a lot of people want to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=4998.0)|
| 1:23:35| But the way that our taxation system works, that's what funds these improvements like sidewalks and sewers and roads and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5015.0)|
| 1:23:44| Some people might say we can't build more houses because there would be more kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5024.0)|
| 1:23:48| The schools are full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5028.0)|
| 1:23:50| The schools are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5030.0)|
| 1:23:52| Well, how do we increase our tax base without building more houses or raising taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5032.0)|
| 1:23:59| My point there is that it's not just the fiscally responsible thing to do, but it's also addressing an inequality between urban dwellers that proportionately pay more for public services than people who live on large tracts of land, even though directly that's not what our property taxes are based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5039.0)|
| 1:24:21| They're based on valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5061.0)|
| 1:24:23| But to my first point, our valuations have gone insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5063.0)|
| 1:24:26| I got a 600% return on my house, which was not my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5066.0)|
| 1:24:31| I wasn't setting out to do that, but that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5071.0)|
| 1:24:36| And I want more people to have the opportunity that I had, which was setting up shop in Knoxville, deciding to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5076.0)|
| 1:24:45| The only way to do that is to create more opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5085.0)|
| 1:24:48| This proposed rezoning is a very, very minimal step toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5088.0)|
| 1:24:57| And for greater equity in taxation and for greater fiscal responsibility, I support the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5097.0)|
| 1:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5107.0)|
| 1:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5108.0)|
| 1:25:10| Next up is John Kane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5110.0)|
| 1:25:18| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5118.0)|
| 1:25:19| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5119.0)|
| 1:25:21| John Kane, PO Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5121.0)|
| 1:25:28| I'm here on behalf of John Huber in connection with this proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5128.0)|
| 1:25:37| I think most of you know sort of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5137.0)|
| 1:25:41| We started out over a year ago with a proposal for RN-5 for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5141.0)|
| 1:25:48| And the neighborhood pushed back, and staff of planning had some questions about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5148.0)|
| 1:25:59| They required change of the sector plan if we were going to go forward with that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5159.0)|
| 1:26:06| We ended up tabling it for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5166.0)|
| 1:26:09| There were meetings between Mr. Huber and the neighborhood representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5169.0)|
| 1:26:16| I think at least two recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5176.0)|
| 1:26:20| We had another meeting with them last week on a date everybody agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5180.0)|
| 1:26:30| Once again, we discussed the issues and our position on proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5190.0)|
| 1:26:39| We untabled, if you will, our request, brought it forward in an amended form seeking RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5199.0)|
| 1:26:48| which is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5208.0)|
| 1:26:54| All of the plans say that this property should be low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5214.0)|
| 1:27:07| MPC staff studied it, and they said we're going to recommend low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5227.0)|
| 1:27:16| That was approved as part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5236.0)|
| 1:27:21| When we submitted our request seeking something in excess of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5241.0)|
| 1:27:27| staff said we want to stick with low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5247.0)|
| 1:27:34| We have now amended that rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5254.0)|
| 1:27:40| We came forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5260.0)|
| 1:27:42| MPC staff studied it, and they recommended approval of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5262.0)|
| 1:27:50| The MPC, no longer that planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5270.0)|
| 1:27:57| said that they approved the position of MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5277.0)|
| 1:28:06| It comes to you that everybody who's looked at it and made a study of it says it should be low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5286.0)|
| 1:28:20| We came asking for low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5300.0)|
| 1:28:26| Now, what seems to be the case is that they wanted all the opponents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5306.0)|
| 1:28:33| more all the property left as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5313.0)|
| 1:28:36| I haven't received any feedback from anybody from that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5316.0)|
| 1:28:40| I don't know whether the neighborhood group had a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5320.0)|
| 1:28:43| or whether they had some alternative to suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5323.0)|
| 1:28:49| but we left the meeting with the issue, in essence, unresolved between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5329.0)|
| 1:28:58| The two issues are ones you've heard many times before, water and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5338.0)|
| 1:29:07| I want you to ask of the engineering department for the city what's going to be done about the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5347.0)|
| 1:29:19| We're going to be held to a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5359.0)|
| 1:29:23| We know that, and we're prepared to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5363.0)|
| 1:29:27| But we're going to leave that situation when we develop a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5367.0)|
| 1:29:33| in a position where there will be no exacerbation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5373.0)|
| 1:29:38| In essence, we're not going to hurt it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5378.0)|
| 1:29:42| We can't fix everything upstream from us by ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5382.0)|
| 1:29:49| but we can make sure and we will make sure that we don't add to any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5389.0)|
| 1:29:55| And please, I'm glad to see engineering here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5395.0)|
| 1:30:01| I always learn something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5401.0)|
| 1:30:04| I gave you two sheets earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5404.0)|
| 1:30:09| On the traffic issue, if you look at the first sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5409.0)|
| 1:30:16| it's a closer-up view and you have all the little buildings that signify houses or structures, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5416.0)|
| 1:30:26| That's the close-up view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5426.0)|
| 1:30:28| I'll let you wrap up that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5428.0)|
| 1:30:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5430.0)|
| 1:30:31| I'll let you wrap up this sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5431.0)|
| 1:30:33| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5433.0)|
| 1:30:34| No more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5434.0)|
| 1:30:36| You can wrap up the sentence you were giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5436.0)|
| 1:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5437.0)|
| 1:30:38| The second one, the second sheet, has a further look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5438.0)|
| 1:30:44| Middlebrook by Pike runs across the lower third east to west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5444.0)|
| 1:30:50| The idea is to get traffic to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5450.0)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5455.0)|
| 1:30:56| We can call on you if we have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5456.0)|
| 1:30:59| That's all of the folks who spoke for, and now we'll move to the folks who spoke against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5459.0)|
| 1:31:04| Now, by the change of the rules, just so you all know, you're going to get two and a half minutes each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5464.0)|
| 1:31:08| so that we can hear from each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5468.0)|
| 1:31:10| First up, we have Ron Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5470.0)|
| 1:31:13| Mr. Ledbetter, please give us your name and address when you come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5473.0)|
| 1:31:18| If it pleases the council, I'll have to talk really quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5478.0)|
| 1:31:21| except I think someone will waive some of their time and give it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5481.0)|
| 1:31:24| I'm Ron Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5484.0)|
| 1:31:25| I reside at 6316 Creekhead Drive, zip code 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5485.0)|
| 1:31:32| My wife and I presented a letter to you explaining what our position was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5492.0)|
| 1:31:38| and I will tell you that represents a vast majority of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5498.0)|
| 1:31:45| We've invited all members of the city council to go and drive around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5505.0)|
| 1:31:51| We've been with some of you so you can see what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5511.0)|
| 1:31:54| But I'm going to very quickly tell you what the three points are that my wife and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5514.0)|
| 1:31:59| and others, why we're against the motion and want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5519.0)|
| 1:32:04| We don't mind RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5524.0)|
| 1:32:06| Now, is that the best possible solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5526.0)|
| 1:32:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5528.0)|
| 1:32:09| The best is to keep it as a part, agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5529.0)|
| 1:32:13| But let me just say what our three reasons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5533.0)|
| 1:32:16| First of all, the idea of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5536.0)|
| 1:32:20| I've worked with organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5540.0)|
| 1:32:22| I worked Saturday to deliver furniture for people who need furniture in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5542.0)|
| 1:32:29| It's not a matter of being for or against affordable housing, for the two speakers that came first, or diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5549.0)|
| 1:32:39| It's time, place, and manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5559.0)|
| 1:32:44| The place where this housing is scheduled to take place is not the appropriate time, place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5564.0)|
| 1:32:52| or manner for helping those needing housing that can't afford to buy a nice home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5572.0)|
| 1:33:02| 1974 is when we moved to Creekhead, and some of you have seen where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5582.0)|
| 1:33:08| There's been a phenomenal growth in people living in Creekhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5588.0)|
| 1:33:13| and that area, and on Helmbolt, and on Francis Road, and many diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5593.0)|
| 1:33:20| We have different races, ethnicities, income levels, some high income, middle, and low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5600.0)|
| 1:33:26| If you look at the map, what's the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5606.0)|
| 1:33:33| It's 95% or more RN1 and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5613.0)|
| 1:33:39| There isn't any RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5619.0)|
| 1:33:41| There's one little neighborhood, and it's a nice neighborhood, but it's not uphill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5621.0)|
| 1:33:46| It doesn't pose a danger to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5626.0)|
| 1:33:48| And so if you look at the surrounding neighborhood, there's not any RN2 mobility where everyone wants to be RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5628.0)|
| 1:33:59| You have one tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5639.0)|
| 1:34:01| Your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5641.0)|
| 1:34:03| I have someone else signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5643.0)|
| 1:34:05| Next up is Seth Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5645.0)|
| 1:34:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5649.0)|
| 1:34:14| Well, Council, that's not what we had agreed to, but is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5654.0)|
| 1:34:18| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5658.0)|
| 1:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5660.0)|
| 1:34:21| We're going to let you have the extra two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5661.0)|
| 1:34:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5664.0)|
| 1:34:25| And I'll try to get it done quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5665.0)|
| 1:34:27| If you just look at the map, you see there is no trend towards RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5667.0)|
| 1:34:34| There's one little neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5674.0)|
| 1:34:36| That's RN2, and all the other exits onto Helmbolt are RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5676.0)|
| 1:34:43| And if you look at the chart that was presented, there's only one piece of property that is reported to be adjacent to the Huber property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5683.0)|
| 1:34:54| and that's RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5694.0)|
| 1:34:56| But if you've looked at it, if you've gone and looked at it, there's six condos on two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5696.0)|
| 1:35:03| That's not cramming property on a small piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5703.0)|
| 1:35:08| Now, so the people in the area are virtually all, let's say 95%, RN1 or agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5708.0)|
| 1:35:20| and we're trying to preserve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5720.0)|
| 1:35:22| Let's go to the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5722.0)|
| 1:35:24| I think you've all been around the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5724.0)|
| 1:35:27| Helmbolt, that's the number one exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5727.0)|
| 1:35:30| That's the connector between north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5730.0)|
| 1:35:33| Well, if you've gone on Helmbolt, and if you've been on an electric roller coaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5733.0)|
| 1:35:40| this would be the best way to describe Helmbolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5740.0)|
| 1:35:44| The traffic is dangerous right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5744.0)|
| 1:35:48| We're going to have people in a community that don't have resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5748.0)|
| 1:35:52| They're going to be walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5752.0)|
| 1:35:54| How are they going to get to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5754.0)|
| 1:35:55| How are the kids getting to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5755.0)|
| 1:35:57| Down Helmbolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5757.0)|
| 1:35:58| Now, I walk Helmbolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5758.0)|
| 1:36:01| We've seen the community grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5761.0)|
| 1:36:04| The community's single-family housing has grown since 1974, grown dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5764.0)|
| 1:36:13| But the roads have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5773.0)|
| 1:36:16| Helmbolt has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5776.0)|
| 1:36:19| However, the danger has increased significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5779.0)|
| 1:36:24| Those of you who have driven on it, and you did it probably in the daytime, try it at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5784.0)|
| 1:36:30| Understand from Mr. Huber that originally they were going to get out of the new neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5790.0)|
| 1:36:36| by crossing over to Creekhead right across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5796.0)|
| 1:36:40| Well, that changed because that was too dangerous, according to city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5800.0)|
| 1:36:47| Just believe me, it's dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5807.0)|
| 1:36:49| and that's the reason you don't want to endanger new people regardless of who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5809.0)|
| 1:36:55| And that's the second reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5815.0)|
| 1:36:57| The third reason has to do with flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5817.0)|
| 1:36:59| And my time is up, and we'll listen from someone else on the flooding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5819.0)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you, Mr. Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5825.0)|
| 1:37:07| Teresa Ledbetter is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5827.0)|
| 1:37:09| Welcome, Teresa Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5829.0)|
| 1:37:11| If you could, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5831.0)|
| 1:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5833.0)|
| 1:37:14| My name is Teresa Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5834.0)|
| 1:37:15| I live at 6316 Creekhead Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5835.0)|
| 1:37:19| and I think it's unfortunate that we're not given the opportunity to be able to address the issues at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5839.0)|
| 1:37:26| So I'm going to condense pretty much what I would have liked to have gone into in more depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5846.0)|
| 1:37:32| had we had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5852.0)|
| 1:37:34| And that is to say that the flooding is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5854.0)|
| 1:37:39| We live in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5859.0)|
| 1:37:41| We have dealt with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5861.0)|
| 1:37:43| It is a difficult area, and it definitely needs some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5863.0)|
| 1:37:48| The rezoning of RN2 is going to be hazardous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5868.0)|
| 1:37:52| and, again, just to pick up and zero in on the issues with road safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5872.0)|
| 1:37:58| for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5878.0)|
| 1:38:02| We've had two fatalities in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5882.0)|
| 1:38:05| It's true that they were 12 years ago in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5885.0)|
| 1:38:08| They did involve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5888.0)|
| 1:38:10| They did involve drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5890.0)|
| 1:38:12| But I cannot help think that how it would have been different for those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5892.0)|
| 1:38:17| if they had not been dealing with narrow rural roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5897.0)|
| 1:38:21| Two hundred and eighty-eight homes have been added to Helmbolt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5901.0)|
| 1:38:26| That's the minor arterial road where this main access point is going to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5906.0)|
| 1:38:31| Two hundred and eighty-eight residences added to the already existing residence on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5911.0)|
| 1:38:39| We simply cannot handle the amount of traffic within that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5919.0)|
| 1:38:47| The other issue I'll just leave with you are two environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5927.0)|
| 1:38:51| One specifically is dealing with wet weather springs, which I'm not familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5931.0)|
| 1:38:59| but I understand there may be an aquifer on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5939.0)|
| 1:39:03| and there's existing water continuing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5943.0)|
| 1:39:07| The other issue that I would like to mention is, in fact, environmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5947.0)|
| 1:39:12| and it has to do with noise pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5952.0)|
| 1:39:14| I don't know how many of you would be willing to live near a train track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5954.0)|
| 1:39:18| but I have the benefit of a smart watch, and when I'm out and with crowds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5958.0)|
| 1:39:22| I get notices about the decibel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5962.0)|
| 1:39:26| If you are living on this property next to the train traffics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5966.0)|
| 1:39:30| you are going to be dealing with that over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5970.0)|
| 1:39:34| and the more exposed time you are in that community, the higher chance for hearing loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5974.0)|
| 1:39:42| I just hope that you will consider smart development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5982.0)|
| 1:39:47| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5987.0)|
| 1:39:49| We are in support of development, but we do want it to be smart development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5989.0)|
| 1:39:54| and thank you for my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5994.0)|
| 1:39:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5995.0)|
| 1:39:57| Next up we have Owen Buin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=5997.0)|
| 1:40:02| Please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6002.0)|
| 1:40:04| My name is Gary Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6004.0)|
| 1:40:06| My wife, Bernadette, and I live at 1608 Helmbolt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6006.0)|
| 1:40:10| and what I want to talk about is you haven't signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6010.0)|
| 1:40:14| I can't hear very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6014.0)|
| 1:40:16| You haven't signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6016.0)|
| 1:40:17| The next speaker is Owen Buin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6017.0)|
| 1:40:20| Is Owen Buin here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6020.0)|
| 1:40:22| Okay, Mr. Buin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6022.0)|
| 1:40:24| Is it Van?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6024.0)|
| 1:40:25| I'm sorry, I couldn't read the handwriting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6025.0)|
| 1:40:28| It's your time to speak, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6028.0)|
| 1:40:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6029.0)|
| 1:40:37| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6037.0)|
| 1:40:38| My name is Owen Buin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6038.0)|
| 1:40:40| I live at 6111 Creekhead Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6040.0)|
| 1:40:42| My family has lived there for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6042.0)|
| 1:40:46| I know this might be pretty boring to you all, but it's very important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6046.0)|
| 1:40:51| and the factor that's most important to me is the safety of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6051.0)|
| 1:40:57| This development, I don't care who moves in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6057.0)|
| 1:41:00| Everybody deserves housing, but, you know, the most important thing is safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6060.0)|
| 1:41:05| and Teresa just indicated how many more cars have been put on our community roads out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6065.0)|
| 1:41:11| and I sent most of you guys an e-mail and asked you to come out and drive our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6071.0)|
| 1:41:15| but don't come at night unless you've got good headlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6075.0)|
| 1:41:18| It's really, really dangerous out there, and the kids, our children don't have any place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6078.0)|
| 1:41:23| If they don't have a ride to school, they're not walking because there's no sidewalks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6083.0)|
| 1:41:29| I live on Creekhead, and when I moved there 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6089.0)|
| 1:41:32| I called the city because I wanted them to paint a line in the middle of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6092.0)|
| 1:41:36| and they said, well, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6096.0)|
| 1:41:38| I said, why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6098.0)|
| 1:41:39| And they said, well, it's not wide enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6099.0)|
| 1:41:41| I thought, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6101.0)|
| 1:41:42| So it's that way today, but the population has grown out there significantly in the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6102.0)|
| 1:41:49| The entrance and the exit of this proposed project has got, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6109.0)|
| 1:41:56| has got a bad line of sight coming and going, and I would just like you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6116.0)|
| 1:42:04| I vote no on this proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6124.0)|
| 1:42:06| I'm not against development, but I think that the development needs to be compatible with neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6126.0)|
| 1:42:13| and ultimately it needs to be safe, and it is not safe right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6133.0)|
| 1:42:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6138.0)|
| 1:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6139.0)|
| 1:42:21| Next up is Yvette Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6141.0)|
| 1:42:28| Ms. Moore, please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6148.0)|
| 1:42:31| My name is Yvette Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6151.0)|
| 1:42:32| I'm at 1813 Francis Road, right next to 1817 Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6152.0)|
| 1:42:37| My concern is not against the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6157.0)|
| 1:42:40| My concern is the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6160.0)|
| 1:42:42| We have been there for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6162.0)|
| 1:42:44| My son, when he went to school at West Hills Elementary at Bearden Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6164.0)|
| 1:42:50| and then he was at West High School, had to walk past from the sidewalks, past the pines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6170.0)|
| 1:42:57| down the side in the grass, cross over at the three-way right there for Himboldt and Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6177.0)|
| 1:43:05| The safety for my grandchildren that live on that road next to me now, we asked for speed bumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6185.0)|
| 1:43:11| We asked for a speed sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6191.0)|
| 1:43:13| We put a speed sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6193.0)|
| 1:43:14| The speed sign got taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6194.0)|
| 1:43:16| Once it flashes so many times every single night where they're racing from Old Amherst down to Francis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6196.0)|
| 1:43:23| and they're flying by, the safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6203.0)|
| 1:43:26| No sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6206.0)|
| 1:43:28| No sidewalks whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6208.0)|
| 1:43:29| We're not against growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6209.0)|
| 1:43:31| We're not against housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6211.0)|
| 1:43:33| We're against R and 2, duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6213.0)|
| 1:43:37| We could R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6217.0)|
| 1:43:39| That's what we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6219.0)|
| 1:43:41| We are a quiet community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6221.0)|
| 1:43:43| Yes, there are a whole lot of houses that have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6223.0)|
| 1:43:45| It is not safe on Himboldt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6225.0)|
| 1:43:47| We had a business off Himboldt where just jeeps sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6227.0)|
| 1:43:51| The wrecks that happened then, 20 years ago, that we used to see pulling out of our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6231.0)|
| 1:43:57| just to get across the street to get back over to Millbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6237.0)|
| 1:44:00| I mean, the chances that you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6240.0)|
| 1:44:02| We've lost animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6242.0)|
| 1:44:04| We don't want to lose children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6244.0)|
| 1:44:06| I mean, it's just the safety concerns, the water, the traffic, the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6246.0)|
| 1:44:12| We live next to a train track, but the trees right now, they buffer that for all of us that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6252.0)|
| 1:44:19| And where this property comes up, it comes right up to everyone that is against this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6259.0)|
| 1:44:25| right onto our property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6265.0)|
| 1:44:27| And they're going to take the trees down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6267.0)|
| 1:44:29| The buffers are not going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6269.0)|
| 1:44:30| The sound, the decimals that come up on your smartphones, I mean, on your watches and your phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6270.0)|
| 1:44:35| that's our biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6275.0)|
| 1:44:37| Again, we are not against growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6277.0)|
| 1:44:40| We're against too many houses being crammed into an area, adding more congestion to both Himboldt and Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6280.0)|
| 1:44:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6291.0)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6292.0)|
| 1:44:54| Next up is John Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6294.0)|
| 1:45:04| John Moore in 1809 Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6304.0)|
| 1:45:07| I live with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6307.0)|
| 1:45:09| We have lived there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6309.0)|
| 1:45:10| I had the property quite a while before my wife and I got married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6310.0)|
| 1:45:15| It is a beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6315.0)|
| 1:45:16| We understand growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6316.0)|
| 1:45:17| The couple gentlemen that got up and spoke, that they were for it, it's nothing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6317.0)|
| 1:45:23| We are happy for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6323.0)|
| 1:45:25| It's just not a safe community to put too many places in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6325.0)|
| 1:45:30| We live there, and some of these folks do live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6330.0)|
| 1:45:33| Most of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6333.0)|
| 1:45:35| When I say we live there, what matters is we've seen the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6335.0)|
| 1:45:39| We've seen the unsaved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6339.0)|
| 1:45:40| We've seen the animals get hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6340.0)|
| 1:45:43| We have fear of our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6343.0)|
| 1:45:51| I've got plenty of time, so I'm going to wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6351.0)|
| 1:45:54| You know, they come up like we don't care about growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6354.0)|
| 1:45:59| We do care about the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6359.0)|
| 1:46:00| We know it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6360.0)|
| 1:46:02| We want it to happen safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6362.0)|
| 1:46:04| Everybody is going to say the same things that are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6364.0)|
| 1:46:07| RN1 is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6367.0)|
| 1:46:09| We'll welcome the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6369.0)|
| 1:46:11| That's what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6371.0)|
| 1:46:13| But we're not supposed to watch our loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6373.0)|
| 1:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6378.0)|
| 1:46:20| Council, that's all the people who have signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6380.0)|
| 1:46:26| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6386.0)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6387.0)|
| 1:46:29| I do want to address the concerns about safety, water, and Mr. Clabo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6389.0)|
| 1:46:37| if you wouldn't mind talking about how we are dealing with these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6397.0)|
| 1:46:40| what we're looking at in sight distance and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6400.0)|
| 1:46:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6404.0)|
| 1:46:45| Tom Clabo, the engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6405.0)|
| 1:46:47| So this particular property is in the Ten Mile Creek watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6407.0)|
| 1:46:53| That has a higher standard when it comes to drainage design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6413.0)|
| 1:46:58| The project would require the pre-development 100-year flood to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6418.0)|
| 1:47:08| and the post-100-year to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6428.0)|
| 1:47:11| So that difference in those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6431.0)|
| 1:47:13| So you don't get any runoff up to the 100-year storm level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6433.0)|
| 1:47:20| It's retained and released slowly over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6440.0)|
| 1:47:23| So that's because it's in this Ten Mile Creek watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6443.0)|
| 1:47:27| which eventually drains into a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6447.0)|
| 1:47:30| So you're typically dealing with volume issues with water there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6450.0)|
| 1:47:34| As far as roadway, we looked at crash reports on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6454.0)|
| 1:47:41| There were five in this area on Hembolt in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6461.0)|
| 1:47:48| It's not really an excessive amount of crashes for this type of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6468.0)|
| 1:47:54| It's a minor arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6474.0)|
| 1:47:56| And with where we're at as far as rezoning, we're not privy to any plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6476.0)|
| 1:48:05| So I don't know exactly what their intent is as far as access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6485.0)|
| 1:48:09| I know there are three potential access points on Hembolt, Old Amherst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6489.0)|
| 1:48:14| and Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6494.0)|
| 1:48:16| I think they've reduced it, I believe so, to one on Hembolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6496.0)|
| 1:48:20| But I wanted you to address the sight distance that somebody had issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6500.0)|
| 1:48:25| that somebody had raised about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6505.0)|
| 1:48:27| Once we do receive plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6507.0)|
| 1:48:31| any access point would require certification by a design professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6511.0)|
| 1:48:37| So we'll have someone look at the speed that's posted 30 miles an hour on Hembolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6517.0)|
| 1:48:43| Someone will look at that to make sure there's adequate sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6523.0)|
| 1:48:46| for those access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6526.0)|
| 1:48:49| So I think that's been changed to 25 if it's a rural, I mean not a rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6529.0)|
| 1:48:53| but a neighborhood road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6533.0)|
| 1:48:55| And then, Mr. Welch, I wanted to ask you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6535.0)|
| 1:48:57| I think there is one misunderstanding that RN2 means duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6537.0)|
| 1:49:03| Could you please talk about the difference between what RN1 allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6543.0)|
| 1:49:06| and what RN2 allows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6546.0)|
| 1:49:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6549.0)|
| 1:49:11| Jeff Welch, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6551.0)|
| 1:49:15| RN1 and RN2 are both low-density residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6555.0)|
| 1:49:20| that can be developed both as single-family and duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6560.0)|
| 1:49:25| The main difference is that in an RN1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6565.0)|
| 1:49:30| the minimum square footage for a single-family lot is 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6570.0)|
| 1:49:36| and for a two-family lot it is 15,000 square feet in a RN1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6576.0)|
| 1:49:41| So there can be single-family and duplex allowed in RN1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6581.0)|
| 1:49:46| For the RN2 zone, the minimum lot size for a single-family unit is 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6586.0)|
| 1:49:54| and for a duplex it would be 10,000 square feet, so it's just reduced in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6594.0)|
| 1:49:59| So you would basically, between RN1 and RN2, you would get X amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6599.0)|
| 1:50:06| potentially, again, based on the topography of the land and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6606.0)|
| 1:50:12| but that's in gross figures is how it might work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6612.0)|
| 1:50:16| So in either RN1 or 2, duplexes are allowed, but that's not what we're doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6616.0)|
| 1:50:23| There would be a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6623.0)|
| 1:50:25| Yes, they would have to come back, special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6625.0)|
| 1:50:27| and they'd have to come back with a concept plan through Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6627.0)|
| 1:50:30| to address all the drainage and traffic issues that Mr. Claybo was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6630.0)|
| 1:50:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6638.0)|
| 1:50:42| One of my big concerns has been, and you guys have heard me talk about the sidewalk on Francis Road so many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6642.0)|
| 1:50:49| and I really, really want that because it is in a parental responsibility zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6649.0)|
| 1:50:55| and I see the issues that are on Humboldt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6655.0)|
| 1:50:58| I also see the issues that are going on with housing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6658.0)|
| 1:51:03| I want people to be safe, but I know that we need houses in such a bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6663.0)|
| 1:51:11| I'm going to let my colleagues ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6671.0)|
| 1:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6674.0)|
| 1:51:16| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6676.0)|
| 1:51:18| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6678.0)|
| 1:51:23| I have a lot to say, so I might have to say a few things and then come back because I have multiple different points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6683.0)|
| 1:51:32| but just one thing that comes to mind, you know, I really want us as a city to commit to smart development as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6692.0)|
| 1:51:42| smart planning, and we do not seem to have, you know, a certain reasoning that we're following with these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6702.0)|
| 1:51:56| that I can find at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6716.0)|
| 1:52:00| You know, when listening to the community members about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6720.0)|
| 1:52:04| it made me think of a development that we voted against on council that was going to be on the merchants, in the merchants area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6724.0)|
| 1:52:17| and, you know, at the time, the residents there wanted a park, wanted to see a park on that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6737.0)|
| 1:52:27| and I went out and visited the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6747.0)|
| 1:52:30| You know, it's merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6750.0)|
| 1:52:32| There are sidewalks, wide street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6752.0)|
| 1:52:34| There was an agreement to put a turning lane in, but that motion failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6754.0)|
| 1:52:40| and it was decided to work with the neighborhood on some sort of housing-slash-park solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6760.0)|
| 1:52:49| In this situation, it doesn't seem like that conversation has happened at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6769.0)|
| 1:52:56| and so I don't know when folks seem to be open to those types of conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6776.0)|
| 1:53:03| but, you know, the previous development that we opposed, I thought would have been great for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6783.0)|
| 1:53:12| This development that, once I visited, the neighborhood does not compare at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6792.0)|
| 1:53:21| The area is much less amenable to increasing the density than the other project that we voted against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6801.0)|
| 1:53:32| I'm also frustrated in terms of planning that this was not dealt with during recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6812.0)|
| 1:53:38| because I thought that we were supposed to be in a period where we've gone through a thorough review of our zoning policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6818.0)|
| 1:53:50| and we're no longer making these little spot changes everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6830.0)|
| 1:53:54| but that is all we have been doing for a good amount of time now, rather than doing the planning that is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6834.0)|
| 1:54:02| and giving residents a heads-up on where we plan to invest as a city to improve the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6842.0)|
| 1:54:10| so that we can increase housing throughout the city that is absolutely needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6850.0)|
| 1:54:17| So this is a frustrating issue for me, because I don't see the infrastructure in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6857.0)|
| 1:54:30| and this area is very familiar to me, where I visited with some neighbors and told them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6870.0)|
| 1:54:40| I've seen the growth in this area, it was an area that my family looked at for several years as a place we were considering moving to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6880.0)|
| 1:54:50| because there were new developments popping up all throughout that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6890.0)|
| 1:54:55| but as you drive into the neighborhood, it has a rural feel to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6895.0)|
| 1:54:59| So I completely understand residents working to maintain the character of their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6899.0)|
| 1:55:07| as we have had other neighbors come before us with the same intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6907.0)|
| 1:55:14| So I have a difficulty supporting this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6914.0)|
| 1:55:18| In other situations, we've had more details, maybe it was a different part of the process, I don't remember exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6918.0)|
| 1:55:28| but I feel like we have voted against projects that have much more infrastructure in place than this area does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6928.0)|
| 1:55:37| I'll leave it at that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6937.0)|
| 1:55:41| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6941.0)|
| 1:55:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6943.0)|
| 1:55:45| So question, if this were to pass, the developer would then go back to Planning Commission with their plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6945.0)|
| 1:55:57| Yes, they would have to develop a concept plan to be presented to planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6957.0)|
| 1:56:03| a review by planning staff, engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6963.0)|
| 1:56:06| and then presented to Planning Commission for a public meeting and a review of that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6966.0)|
| 1:56:15| Okay, so would that be where the flood runoff mitigation, flood mitigation, traffic safety, access roads, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6975.0)|
| 1:56:24| is that where that conversation would take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6984.0)|
| 1:56:28| That is where those details would be discussed as far as access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6988.0)|
| 1:56:33| how to address the safe access to and from it, stormwater management would all be addressed at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=6993.0)|
| 1:56:40| based on the concept that they present, road layout and lot layouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7000.0)|
| 1:56:47| My next question, who would be responsible for stormwater management and some of these things we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7007.0)|
| 1:56:53| I know city would be more than likely the sidewalks, but would that be on the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7013.0)|
| 1:56:57| Is that something that the city would take care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7017.0)|
| 1:57:03| Tom Klebel, engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7023.0)|
| 1:57:05| So as far as the process, the engineering department would review those concept plans related to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7025.0)|
| 1:57:13| So if there's a detention or retention pond required for any of the stormwater facilities within that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7033.0)|
| 1:57:20| we would review those at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7040.0)|
| 1:57:23| So but who builds it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7043.0)|
| 1:57:24| Is that the developer or is that the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7044.0)|
| 1:57:26| That would be the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7046.0)|
| 1:57:27| The developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7047.0)|
| 1:57:29| So there would be an opportunity for and also an opportunity for additional input once those design plans are presented by the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7049.0)|
| 1:57:37| and would they come back before council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7057.0)|
| 1:57:43| They would not come back before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7063.0)|
| 1:57:45| They would rest with planning commission as far as the approval of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7065.0)|
| 1:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7072.0)|
| 1:57:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7073.0)|
| 1:57:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7074.0)|
| 1:57:55| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7075.0)|
| 1:57:59| Oh, it's Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7079.0)|
| 1:58:01| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7081.0)|
| 1:58:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7082.0)|
| 1:58:03| I wanted to comment some on Councilperson Parker's comments about what happened on Merchants Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7083.0)|
| 1:58:10| and this does not contradict anything you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7090.0)|
| 1:58:13| It's just an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7093.0)|
| 1:58:15| It's just an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7095.0)|
| 1:58:17| This council did hear an attempt to rezone that under a different developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7097.0)|
| 1:58:25| It didn't pass here or it was actually downzoned here and after that the developer withdrew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7105.0)|
| 1:58:33| because he didn't get the high level that he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7113.0)|
| 1:58:37| Since then, a new developer has come in with a new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7117.0)|
| 1:58:41| and we've met with the neighborhoods and it's agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7121.0)|
| 1:58:46| and there will be density on Merchants Road but then the rest of it will be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7126.0)|
| 1:58:53| So what we had aspired to knock on wood is coming into place and that's just now coming up through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7133.0)|
| 1:59:01| So that worked out and this council was wise to not take that first attempt to rezone it by a different developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7141.0)|
| 1:59:11| and have some patience and another developer came in and it's working out really well so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7151.0)|
| 1:59:18| and I'm very optimistic about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7158.0)|
| 1:59:20| So I just wanted to update you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7160.0)|
| 1:59:23| I did have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7163.0)|
| 1:59:26| Just one from Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7166.0)|
| 1:59:29| You explained the 10,000 versus 5,000 between minimal lots between RM1 and RM2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7169.0)|
| 1:59:37| A little math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7177.0)|
| 1:59:39| Could you speak into the mic, Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7179.0)|
| 1:59:40| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7180.0)|
| 1:59:41| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7181.0)|
| 1:59:42| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7182.0)|
| 1:59:44| The 16.6 acres, how many dwelling units would be able to fit on that under RM1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7184.0)|
| 1:59:55| Just in gross numbers, you'd have to, yeah, without taking out land for roads and things like that so it's easily matched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7195.0)|
| 2:00:04| Under RM1s, there could be a 10,000 square foot lot so approximately 72 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7204.0)|
| 2:00:11| Gross, again, without, you'd have to subtract out maybe 20% to take account for roads and things of that nature and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7211.0)|
| 2:00:20| But I'm just talking on the gross numbers, 72 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7220.0)|
| 2:00:24| I'm just trying to get ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7224.0)|
| 2:00:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7226.0)|
| 2:00:27| You haven't had time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7227.0)|
| 2:00:28| And then under RM2, would it be roughly double that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7228.0)|
| 2:00:31| RM2, if it was a single family lot, it would be 144 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7231.0)|
| 2:00:37| So, again, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7237.0)|
| 2:00:39| You'd get about half under RM1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7239.0)|
| 2:00:41| Yeah, approximately double or half, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7241.0)|
| 2:00:42| That's consistent with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7242.0)|
| 2:00:44| And just a couple of questions for the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7244.0)|
| 2:00:50| Mr. Huber's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7250.0)|
| 2:00:52| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7252.0)|
| 2:00:53| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7253.0)|
| 2:00:54| Mr. King, I've known you for years and I blanked on your name, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7254.0)|
| 2:00:58| I've got just a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7258.0)|
| 2:01:03| How many units is proposed under Mr. Huber's design so far or what's his kind of conception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7263.0)|
| 2:01:17| I know there's not a detailed plan, but what's the conception of how many units would be there under his plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7277.0)|
| 2:01:25| To answer your question, as I understand it, we don't have a plan as yet as to what we're going to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7285.0)|
| 2:01:35| and I can't answer a question about a number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7295.0)|
| 2:01:39| The engineers are already, I think, doing work on the early stage work on the water issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7299.0)|
| 2:01:48| and the surface water management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7308.0)|
| 2:01:51| That's going to take out some space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7311.0)|
| 2:01:55| The size of it has to be, of the retention pond, has to be about 50% bigger than ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7315.0)|
| 2:02:03| Then we've got roads to go in and look at how things are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7323.0)|
| 2:02:10| So we haven't really started that sort of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7330.0)|
| 2:02:14| We're waiting on getting this zoning done, and then once that's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7334.0)|
| 2:02:20| and we know the parameters of what we've got to deal with, we'll be looking at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7340.0)|
| 2:02:26| But I can tell you now that RM1 will not work for this property for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7346.0)|
| 2:02:35| The one thing I might mention, because I didn't hear it, and if it was said, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7355.0)|
| 2:02:47| but if you have RM2, for example, I know this group is worried about a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7367.0)|
| 2:02:56| that includes duplexes, townhome type structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7376.0)|
| 2:03:06| If that is proposed, once we get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7386.0)|
| 2:03:10| if that is proposed, that's what we want to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7390.0)|
| 2:03:16| We do have to come back through the process, like a use-only view at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7396.0)|
| 2:03:22| and go all the way through the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7402.0)|
| 2:03:25| Mr. Thomas, your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7405.0)|
| 2:03:28| Mr. King, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7408.0)|
| 2:03:30| Our time has expired, and I will defer to Councilperson Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7410.0)|
| 2:03:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7413.0)|
| 2:03:34| I think I've got Councilmember Testerman next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7414.0)|
| 2:03:37| Oh, she's next? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7417.0)|
| 2:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7420.0)|
| 2:03:42| Mr. Welch, I have had some conversation with you about a number of units as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7422.0)|
| 2:03:49| and I guess Mr. Thomas or Councilman Thomas just asked a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7429.0)|
| 2:03:54| and he had a different number for acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7434.0)|
| 2:03:57| When I look at the parcel, it's 14.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7437.0)|
| 2:04:02| I don't know if somebody wants to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7442.0)|
| 2:04:04| We're rezoning one piece of property that's 14.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7444.0)|
| 2:04:08| That's the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7448.0)|
| 2:04:10| I'm looking at the rezoning report, and it has 16.6 acres, Councilman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7450.0)|
| 2:04:15| So I have not pulled it up on my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7455.0)|
| 2:04:19| Mr. King, does that include the property that's the other lots that adjoin it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7459.0)|
| 2:04:26| touching Francis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7466.0)|
| 2:04:29| Yes, the acreage that gets that higher number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7469.0)|
| 2:04:37| Something like four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7477.0)|
| 2:04:39| Four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7479.0)|
| 2:04:41| So how many lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7481.0)|
| 2:04:43| So there are four lots included for the rezoning, and so it's not just the 14.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7483.0)|
| 2:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7490.0)|
| 2:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7491.0)|
| 2:04:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7492.0)|
| 2:04:54| So, Mr. Welch, I guess the number you and I talked about was specific to the 14.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7494.0)|
| 2:05:00| So if the total is 16.6, the number of allowable units for duplex under R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7500.0)|
| 2:05:11| so a duplex lot has to be a minimum of 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7511.0)|
| 2:05:16| and you have two units per lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7516.0)|
| 2:05:18| and you're a lot better at dividing acreage than me because I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7518.0)|
| 2:05:22| many whatevers per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7522.0)|
| 2:05:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7524.0)|
| 2:05:25| So tell me, 16.6, if it were all duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7525.0)|
| 2:05:29| If it was all duplex, excuse me, again, gross numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7529.0)|
| 2:05:33| Gross numbers, not subtracting out 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7533.0)|
| 2:05:36| Not subtracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7536.0)|
| 2:05:37| So this is an illogical high number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7537.0)|
| 2:05:39| Yes, 72 lots under R and 2 for duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7539.0)|
| 2:05:44| which would equate to approximately 144 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7544.0)|
| 2:05:50| Units, dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7550.0)|
| 2:05:51| Units, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7551.0)|
| 2:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7552.0)|
| 2:05:53| Which would be the same amount of dwelling units that could be maximally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7553.0)|
| 2:05:56| developed under single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7556.0)|
| 2:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7558.0)|
| 2:05:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7559.0)|
| 2:06:00| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7560.0)|
| 2:06:01| I had a couple other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7561.0)|
| 2:06:02| I mean, there's a lot, and it's hard to cover everything in our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7562.0)|
| 2:06:04| I appreciate Councilman Thomas clarifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7564.0)|
| 2:06:07| because I was confused when Councilwoman Parker was talking about rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7567.0)|
| 2:06:11| I thought she meant the one in Betty Jo's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7571.0)|
| 2:06:16| which was an R and 4 request that passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7576.0)|
| 2:06:20| So you're talking about the one at Merchant's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7580.0)|
| 2:06:23| and that was an R and 5 request that got turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7583.0)|
| 2:06:27| So I just was having a hard time, and I needed to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7587.0)|
| 2:06:32| and I'm having a hard time with the comparison of R and 5 to R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7592.0)|
| 2:06:37| I think it's important to note that R and 1 and R and 2 are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7597.0)|
| 2:06:41| interchangeable across the city, and 80% this is what's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7601.0)|
| 2:06:47| I understand that folks are not going to agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7607.0)|
| 2:06:50| I get it, Mr. Ledbetter, you're not going to agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7610.0)|
| 2:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7612.0)|
| 2:06:53| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7613.0)|
| 2:06:54| We're just not going to agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7614.0)|
| 2:06:55| Here's what's important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7615.0)|
| 2:06:57| 80% of the residential land in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7617.0)|
| 2:07:02| I just want you to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7622.0)|
| 2:07:04| I get the chance to state the facts that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7624.0)|
| 2:07:07| and that we talk about here all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7627.0)|
| 2:07:09| I'm not trying to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7629.0)|
| 2:07:10| Eighty percent of the residential land in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7630.0)|
| 2:07:14| is zoned R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7634.0)|
| 2:07:17| That's single family zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7637.0)|
| 2:07:19| Some people live on single families of 5,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7639.0)|
| 2:07:24| Many, many, many in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7644.0)|
| 2:07:26| And we have straight roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7646.0)|
| 2:07:27| I'll acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7647.0)|
| 2:07:29| I grew up on a crooked dirt road through the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7649.0)|
| 2:07:31| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7651.0)|
| 2:07:32| Grew up in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7652.0)|
| 2:07:37| At the rate we're going with 80% of our land, R and 1 and R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7657.0)|
| 2:07:43| we can't house everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7663.0)|
| 2:07:46| Ms. Ledbetter had a problem getting in touch with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7666.0)|
| 2:07:48| because my phone never stops ringing, texting, meetings on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7668.0)|
| 2:07:52| et cetera, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7672.0)|
| 2:07:54| Part of that is people constantly contacting us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7674.0)|
| 2:07:57| talking about places to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7677.0)|
| 2:07:59| people that work for the city administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7679.0)|
| 2:08:02| people I work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7682.0)|
| 2:08:04| And I understand that doesn't have to be solved in all places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7684.0)|
| 2:08:08| don't have to solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7688.0)|
| 2:08:10| But if we only accept single family zoning everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7690.0)|
| 2:08:15| we're never going to get there because that's where we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7695.0)|
| 2:08:18| and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7698.0)|
| 2:08:19| And so that I want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7699.0)|
| 2:08:20| I bring that up real quickly to address one of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7700.0)|
| 2:08:23| Councilwoman Parker brought up is why wasn't this fixed in recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7703.0)|
| 2:08:27| And the reason was is because no one wanted anything but R and 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7707.0)|
| 2:08:31| and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7711.0)|
| 2:08:33| That's why the maps look like they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7713.0)|
| 2:08:34| That's why it wasn't fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7714.0)|
| 2:08:36| And the only places that they were amended were places where there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7716.0)|
| 2:08:40| individual discussions with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7720.0)|
| 2:08:42| And I gave, I believe, 80 edits to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7722.0)|
| 2:08:45| and got some R and 4 and R and 5 in my district with straight roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7725.0)|
| 2:08:50| and grid-like patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7730.0)|
| 2:08:52| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7732.0)|
| 2:08:56| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7736.0)|
| 2:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7738.0)|
| 2:09:00| I just kind of go back to a couple of things that this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7740.0)|
| 2:09:05| originally started out with the request of R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7745.0)|
| 2:09:09| And based on feedback from neighbors and residents in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7749.0)|
| 2:09:15| pulled that request to reevaluate to then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7755.0)|
| 2:09:19| and request R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7759.0)|
| 2:09:23| I've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7763.0)|
| 2:09:25| I do think it's a gift when you have a developer who's willing to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7765.0)|
| 2:09:29| to the neighbors in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7769.0)|
| 2:09:31| meet with them on three different occasions to really try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7771.0)|
| 2:09:35| and be a good steward of the project and the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7775.0)|
| 2:09:40| and to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7780.0)|
| 2:09:44| This housing and this developer is dedicated to affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7784.0)|
| 2:09:50| and the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7790.0)|
| 2:09:53| and precisely what we have dedicated an upcoming workshop for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7793.0)|
| 2:09:59| Housing for young professionals, for our first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7799.0)|
| 2:10:05| for teachers, also for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7805.0)|
| 2:10:09| There are seniors who are looking to downsize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7809.0)|
| 2:10:12| looking specifically for housing just like what's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7812.0)|
| 2:10:17| and they can't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7817.0)|
| 2:10:20| So we have a wide breadth of demographics that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7820.0)|
| 2:10:27| are unable to find housing that is suited for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7827.0)|
| 2:10:34| And so, again, I go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7834.0)|
| 2:10:38| The Planning Commission approved it unanimously at 11-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7838.0)|
| 2:10:43| I have to go back and say they are also an appointed body and experts in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7843.0)|
| 2:10:52| I am sympathetic to the fact that infrastructure, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7852.0)|
| 2:10:58| we can't, it's impossible to be able to sync our infrastructure lock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7858.0)|
| 2:11:04| and step with development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7864.0)|
| 2:11:06| but it doesn't mean that we can't continue to address the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7866.0)|
| 2:11:10| as on Francis Road and around the corner on McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7870.0)|
| 2:11:17| There are definitely needs for sidewalks and improved infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7877.0)|
| 2:11:21| and widened roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7881.0)|
| 2:11:23| but I don't think that we can always use that as an excuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7883.0)|
| 2:11:26| to negate the need for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7886.0)|
| 2:11:31| I certainly understand the concerns, the safety, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7891.0)|
| 2:11:39| but just trying to look at the bigger picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7899.0)|
| 2:11:41| and also, again, going back to the fact that R and 5 now R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7901.0)|
| 2:11:48| and the virtual difference is lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7908.0)|
| 2:11:52| So, again, I feel like this particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7912.0)|
| 2:11:56| and this developer is trying to be a good steward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7916.0)|
| 2:11:58| is trying to be considerate of the neighbors in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7918.0)|
| 2:12:03| and wants to be amenable and listen to what the concerns are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7923.0)|
| 2:12:09| but I have to look at the need of what we're trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7929.0)|
| 2:12:15| and that missing middle housing and affordability aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7935.0)|
| 2:12:24| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7944.0)|
| 2:12:27| I wanted to reiterate two things which we've brought up here before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7947.0)|
| 2:12:32| on council and in our forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7952.0)|
| 2:12:36| but I'm not in agreement that simply increasing our housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7956.0)|
| 2:12:42| will produce affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7962.0)|
| 2:12:47| We've had presentations by the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7967.0)|
| 2:12:50| about their aggressive recruitment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7970.0)|
| 2:12:53| bringing new, young talent to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7973.0)|
| 2:12:58| We know that there are numbers of people moving to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7978.0)|
| 2:13:02| with higher incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7982.0)|
| 2:13:05| Unless we are intentional about our planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7985.0)|
| 2:13:08| then we will not actually see an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7988.0)|
| 2:13:11| in our affordable housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7991.0)|
| 2:13:13| We may see an increase in housing stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7993.0)|
| 2:13:16| but it's not necessarily going to be affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7996.0)|
| 2:13:18| or for the people that we lift up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=7998.0)|
| 2:13:21| and say that that housing is intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8001.0)|
| 2:13:25| I still believe that we need smart planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8005.0)|
| 2:13:32| I do think that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8012.0)|
| 2:13:34| Sorry, there was one other point that I wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8014.0)|
| 2:13:39| I do think that the infrastructure issues should go hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8019.0)|
| 2:13:48| We have a zoning plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8028.0)|
| 2:13:52| so that we can anticipate the infrastructure investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8032.0)|
| 2:13:57| that may be needed in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8037.0)|
| 2:14:00| I know we made one decision...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8040.0)|
| 2:14:06| I'm forgetting the name of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8046.0)|
| 2:14:08| In the Inskip area around the public swimming pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8048.0)|
| 2:14:12| and we really pushed for there to be a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8052.0)|
| 2:14:14| to a sidewalk in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8054.0)|
| 2:14:17| I'm not sure there is that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8057.0)|
| 2:14:20| or that sidewalk is moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8060.0)|
| 2:14:22| and we're hearing about a sidewalk need on Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8062.0)|
| 2:14:25| When we address those issues in the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8065.0)|
| 2:14:30| and it really should have been addressed during recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8070.0)|
| 2:14:34| even if there was pushback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8074.0)|
| 2:14:36| we know that we need areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8076.0)|
| 2:14:41| where smaller lots can be used for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8081.0)|
| 2:14:46| to make them more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8086.0)|
| 2:14:48| We know that we need areas where it's more dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8088.0)|
| 2:14:51| but those have to be located near public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8091.0)|
| 2:14:55| near where we either have the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8095.0)|
| 2:14:57| or we are making plans to invest in the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8097.0)|
| 2:15:02| My concern is that we make these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8102.0)|
| 2:15:05| as our commitment to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8105.0)|
| 2:15:08| and it doesn't go far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8108.0)|
| 2:15:11| It has to have the planning combined with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8111.0)|
| 2:15:17| I'm struggling to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8117.0)|
| 2:15:18| I hear what you all are arguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8118.0)|
| 2:15:20| in terms of the difference between R and 1, R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8120.0)|
| 2:15:24| and I agree with those differences that have been shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8124.0)|
| 2:15:27| The only major difference is the number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8127.0)|
| 2:15:33| You know, it can be single family, it can be a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8133.0)|
| 2:15:36| but it does increase the number of people in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8136.0)|
| 2:15:40| and that does create more stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8140.0)|
| 2:15:42| on the infrastructure in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8142.0)|
| 2:15:46| and that was the same issue that we discussed around merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8146.0)|
| 2:15:49| Now, merchants can handle a higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8149.0)|
| 2:15:53| than this area can handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8153.0)|
| 2:15:55| but it doesn't mean that if we take a step back and ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8155.0)|
| 2:16:00| can there be some sort of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8160.0)|
| 2:16:04| that would allow for some green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8164.0)|
| 2:16:07| that would take into consideration the buffers needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8167.0)|
| 2:16:10| between the railroad and the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8170.0)|
| 2:16:13| that we might actually come up with a better proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8173.0)|
| 2:16:17| and that's where I'm at on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8177.0)|
| 2:16:19| I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8179.0)|
| 2:16:21| I think that the projects John Hoover wants to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8181.0)|
| 2:16:26| in our city are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8186.0)|
| 2:16:28| and I want to support them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8188.0)|
| 2:16:30| but I want to see a planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8190.0)|
| 2:16:33| that does take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8193.0)|
| 2:16:35| these other very obvious issues in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8195.0)|
| 2:16:39| and to some degree a commitment from the city to address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8199.0)|
| 2:16:43| not simply just through the engineering process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8203.0)|
| 2:16:46| but through the real infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8206.0)|
| 2:16:50| that are needed, the sidewalks, the widened roads, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8210.0)|
| 2:16:55| and so that's where I'm at on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8215.0)|
| 2:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8218.0)|
| 2:16:59| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8219.0)|
| 2:17:03| I'll go to Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8223.0)|
| 2:17:07| Again, I'll give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8227.0)|
| 2:17:09| Councilwoman Parker, you mentioned Bruin Road, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8229.0)|
| 2:17:13| and this doesn't, again, contradict anything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8233.0)|
| 2:17:17| It's just an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8237.0)|
| 2:17:18| In that case, it was the same developer, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8238.0)|
| 2:17:21| and this council, over my objection, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8241.0)|
| 2:17:25| approved an RN-5 for that, and there was no sidewalk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8245.0)|
| 2:17:30| You couldn't get to a bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8250.0)|
| 2:17:32| Since that time, I've been in discussions with city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8252.0)|
| 2:17:36| and to some degree the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8256.0)|
| 2:17:38| about the urgent need for a sidewalk there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8258.0)|
| 2:17:44| and they've been open to these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8264.0)|
| 2:17:46| They're still ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8266.0)|
| 2:17:49| My hope is that the developer will pay for the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8269.0)|
| 2:17:53| because it's their development that's causing the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8273.0)|
| 2:17:59| and I don't want to see costs shifted from the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8279.0)|
| 2:18:03| the city taxpayers, to remedy infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8283.0)|
| 2:18:07| which the density there is making that necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8287.0)|
| 2:18:12| So anyway, that's just an update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8292.0)|
| 2:18:14| but I had a question for Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8294.0)|
| 2:18:18| a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8298.0)|
| 2:18:20| Are there any sidewalks in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8300.0)|
| 2:18:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8304.0)|
| 2:18:26| No, no, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8306.0)|
| 2:18:28| Mr. King, please speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8308.0)|
| 2:18:31| Please speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8311.0)|
| 2:18:36| I was thinking about that for you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8316.0)|
| 2:18:38| and I'm the worst of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8318.0)|
| 2:18:43| There are not sidewalks generally in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8323.0)|
| 2:18:49| Topography is East Tennessee topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8329.0)|
| 2:18:53| and some of the places it would be difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8333.0)|
| 2:18:57| to construct sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8337.0)|
| 2:19:00| But as far as this project, this property is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8340.0)|
| 2:19:05| when we develop the proposal we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8345.0)|
| 2:19:11| we'll be building sidewalks along the frontage of Hembo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8351.0)|
| 2:19:16| Our frontage, we'll put sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8356.0)|
| 2:19:20| But the way that problem is going to get solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8360.0)|
| 2:19:24| is over a period of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8364.0)|
| 2:19:27| when somebody does something with another piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8367.0)|
| 2:19:30| you can, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8370.0)|
| 2:19:32| and you do require that they put in sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8372.0)|
| 2:19:37| as an example of what transpires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8377.0)|
| 2:19:40| So now, right now we'll be putting in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8380.0)|
| 2:19:45| Somebody else, a few days hence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8385.0)|
| 2:19:49| will start another project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8389.0)|
| 2:19:52| and end up putting in sidewalks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8392.0)|
| 2:19:55| There is a sidewalk down to Taney Hill or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8395.0)|
| 2:20:04| There is a short section of sidewalk at one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8404.0)|
| 2:20:10| But generally, sidewalks are not in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8410.0)|
| 2:20:15| I've seen the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8415.0)|
| 2:20:17| The sidewalk you're addressing is in front of the pines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8417.0)|
| 2:20:21| The pines, yeah, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8421.0)|
| 2:20:23| We're near this property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8423.0)|
| 2:20:24| Well, you know, they're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8424.0)|
| 2:20:27| Okay, you've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8427.0)|
| 2:20:29| They asked if there was anything in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8429.0)|
| 2:20:31| and I tried to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8431.0)|
| 2:20:33| And I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8433.0)|
| 2:20:35| Is there any bus service out to this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8435.0)|
| 2:20:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8438.0)|
| 2:20:40| Don't know what kind of bus service you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8440.0)|
| 2:20:43| Yeah, that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8443.0)|
| 2:20:45| I'm talking about camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8445.0)|
| 2:20:46| Public transportation buses are not operating in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8446.0)|
| 2:20:52| School buses operate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8452.0)|
| 2:20:55| No, no, no, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8455.0)|
| 2:20:58| I followed one about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8458.0)|
| 2:21:01| You need to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8461.0)|
| 2:21:03| We need to have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8463.0)|
| 2:21:05| And I actually just asked about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8465.0)|
| 2:21:07| I need to be speaking, not the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8467.0)|
| 2:21:09| And I actually just asked about the public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8469.0)|
| 2:21:12| So it sounds like the residences of this new project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8472.0)|
| 2:21:19| would essentially...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8479.0)|
| 2:21:20| I'm sorry, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8480.0)|
| 2:21:22| It sounds like the residents of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8482.0)|
| 2:21:24| would almost certainly have to have transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8484.0)|
| 2:21:31| in and out of there by automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8491.0)|
| 2:21:34| Well, if you'll look at where I ended earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8494.0)|
| 2:21:41| the second sheet of paper that I gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8501.0)|
| 2:21:44| doesn't have the little houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8504.0)|
| 2:21:46| It's just a road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8506.0)|
| 2:21:48| Across the bottom, one-third down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8508.0)|
| 2:21:51| all the way across the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8511.0)|
| 2:21:53| you see Middlebrook Pike running from east to west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8513.0)|
| 2:21:57| I thought I'd like to look at this transportation question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8517.0)|
| 2:22:03| a little bit differently or try to visualize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8523.0)|
| 2:22:06| And that's when I said, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8526.0)|
| 2:22:08| Let's see what a visual is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8528.0)|
| 2:22:10| I'm sorry, I think my time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8530.0)|
| 2:22:12| Your time is up, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8532.0)|
| 2:22:14| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8534.0)|
| 2:22:15| Mr. Smith, I mean, Councilmember Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8535.0)|
| 2:22:17| hasn't had a chance to speak yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8537.0)|
| 2:22:18| so I'm going to go ahead and turn to Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8538.0)|
| 2:22:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8541.0)|
| 2:22:22| There was a discussion earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8542.0)|
| 2:22:24| about intentional planning by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8544.0)|
| 2:22:26| Mr. Welch, the way we do that is through sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8546.0)|
| 2:22:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8549.0)|
| 2:22:31| I'm sorry, I missed the first part of the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8551.0)|
| 2:22:33| Mr. Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8553.0)|
| 2:22:35| There was a discussion earlier about intentional planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8555.0)|
| 2:22:37| for where we want housing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8557.0)|
| 2:22:39| The way that we dictate as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8559.0)|
| 2:22:41| where we want certain types of housing is a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8561.0)|
| 2:22:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8564.0)|
| 2:22:45| Through the sector plan and then one-year plan process, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8565.0)|
| 2:22:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8568.0)|
| 2:22:49| And for this area, including the adjacent neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8569.0)|
| 2:22:54| those are all LDR, low-density residential, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8574.0)|
| 2:22:59| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8579.0)|
| 2:23:00| And low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8580.0)|
| 2:23:02| R and 1 and R and 2 are both allowed in those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8582.0)|
| 2:23:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8585.0)|
| 2:23:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8586.0)|
| 2:23:07| Just to the neighbors who are concerned about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8587.0)|
| 2:23:10| and the road safety, I share your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8590.0)|
| 2:23:14| I promise there aren't many straight roads in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8594.0)|
| 2:23:17| so if you come south of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8597.0)|
| 2:23:19| I can show you very little margin to walk along there safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8599.0)|
| 2:23:22| including for my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8602.0)|
| 2:23:24| So I hear your concerns sincerely on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8604.0)|
| 2:23:27| I live in an R and 2 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8607.0)|
| 2:23:29| that's way more than 16 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8609.0)|
| 2:23:32| and just outside of there you don't have sidewalks anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8612.0)|
| 2:23:35| so I feel your pain big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8615.0)|
| 2:23:37| And there's nobody that bothers the mayor and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8617.0)|
| 2:23:39| about spending more money on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8619.0)|
| 2:23:41| Well, I don't know, maybe my colleagues might disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8621.0)|
| 2:23:43| Maybe they compete for sidewalks more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8623.0)|
| 2:23:45| But I want to ask a question about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8625.0)|
| 2:23:48| I think it's genuinely impossible to build out enough sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8628.0)|
| 2:23:54| in R and 2 and R and 1 across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8634.0)|
| 2:23:57| I think Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8637.0)|
| 2:23:59| I'll take your word for the 80% number that, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8639.0)|
| 2:24:02| it would be impossible to build enough sidewalks proactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8642.0)|
| 2:24:07| So I just don't think it's genuine for any of us to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8647.0)|
| 2:24:11| that we can proactively get ahead of all new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8651.0)|
| 2:24:14| with enough infrastructure that we're all going to be pleased with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8654.0)|
| 2:24:17| It's just not reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8657.0)|
| 2:24:18| Now, to Councilmember Thomas' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8658.0)|
| 2:24:20| developers can collaborate with neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8660.0)|
| 2:24:22| and can go an extra mile, no pun intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8662.0)|
| 2:24:25| with sidewalks and infrastructure to help supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8665.0)|
| 2:24:27| So I think no matter how this vote goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8667.0)|
| 2:24:30| I don't think that should be ignored or left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8670.0)|
| 2:24:35| I think there's continued collaboration no matter what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8675.0)|
| 2:24:38| But, Mr. Brace, what is our outstanding sidewalk budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8678.0)|
| 2:24:43| for the ones that we'd like to complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8683.0)|
| 2:24:46| I think we had a workshop on this or discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8686.0)|
| 2:24:49| Yeah, David Brace, COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8689.0)|
| 2:24:51| So we have a sidewalk plan, and I'm going to look over at Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8691.0)|
| 2:24:55| I want to say that it is in the, Tom, do you remember the total number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8695.0)|
| 2:25:00| It's got to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8700.0)|
| 2:25:01| Yeah, it's in the $2 billion range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8701.0)|
| 2:25:04| $2 billion range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8704.0)|
| 2:25:05| So obviously there's a list of priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8705.0)|
| 2:25:07| and there are areas and key connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8707.0)|
| 2:25:09| but the wants and the available resources, it's in the billions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8709.0)|
| 2:25:13| Yeah, I think we average a new sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8713.0)|
| 2:25:16| that's not part of a new development in South Knoxville 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8716.0)|
| 2:25:18| every two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8718.0)|
| 2:25:20| So I think just for the broader public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8720.0)|
| 2:25:22| in terms of expectations around sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8722.0)|
| 2:25:24| I know you all get this, but nobody can build sidewalks fast enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8724.0)|
| 2:25:29| and the housing need is obviously more urgent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8729.0)|
| 2:25:35| We're going to have to deal with it faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8735.0)|
| 2:25:37| than we can build sidewalks or afford to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8737.0)|
| 2:25:39| That list of sidewalks will outlive all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8739.0)|
| 2:25:42| So I just think a reality check just for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8742.0)|
| 2:25:45| as we discuss these and any new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8745.0)|
| 2:25:47| that we should proactively have infrastructure ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8747.0)|
| 2:25:50| for new rezonings, I think, is just not a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8750.0)|
| 2:25:55| But I would just reiterate that collaboration can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8755.0)|
| 2:25:58| between developers beyond what they're required to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8758.0)|
| 2:26:01| and I don't think that should stop if we approve this or don't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8761.0)|
| 2:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8766.0)|
| 2:26:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8767.0)|
| 2:26:08| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8768.0)|
| 2:26:10| I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8770.0)|
| 2:26:11| Yeah, I'll go and let Ms. Councilwoman Singh close it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8771.0)|
| 2:26:17| So since we're all talking about the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8777.0)|
| 2:26:20| I pulled up the sidewalk study because I love facts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8780.0)|
| 2:26:23| reference queen over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8783.0)|
| 2:26:26| So ballpark, it's like 0.7 miles from the Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8786.0)|
| 2:26:32| so the school is within that, of sidewalk down Francis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8792.0)|
| 2:26:37| and then the last 0.6-ish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8797.0)|
| 2:26:40| and again I'm using KGIS as my measuring tool so not perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8800.0)|
| 2:26:45| that is the 1.6 about miles, 1.5 miles from the school to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8805.0)|
| 2:26:53| So about half of it, around about half of it is missing sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8813.0)|
| 2:26:58| But it is identified, this entire area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8818.0)|
| 2:27:01| Helmbolt and that lacking part in Francis and old Amherst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8821.0)|
