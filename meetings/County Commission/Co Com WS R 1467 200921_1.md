| 2:32:11| so they can inform us what the money is going to be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| and why they are requesting that money or why we are giving that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| so we can have a better understanding of the situation instead of just guessing what the $125,000 is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| Well, right now the motion is to move it forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| We can certainly make them aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| If this were to pass and move forward, we could make them aware that they could come next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9148)|
| 2:32:33| because we will not vote on it until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Then if the information was not adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| and somebody wanted to make a substitute motion removing that, they could do that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| So we do have an opportunity next week and a week to inform them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| Good new guy question, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Good new guy question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| Good new guy question, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| I will go back to Commissioner Beeler, and then I'll go to Daley, and then back to Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Mr. VandeVeit may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| He's standing at the podium, or perhaps Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| What is the annual subscription for residential for the Carnes Volunteer Fire Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| It's based on your square footage and your lot size, I imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| I don't know what the average would be, but I'm sure they could tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| I just wonder what the average would be for, say, I don't know, a $300,000 home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| Perhaps our next speaker, Mr. Daley, could inform us with a piece of paper in his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| Daley is quite informed on these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| Do you want me to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| This is from Carnes Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| For any residential structure equal to or less than 900 square feet, a $100 membership fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| That includes mobile homes when rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| It doesn't say anything over 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| I think Terry may live in something over 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| But I do know rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| I have less than 2,000 square feet, and I pay $280 a year, if that gives you a reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9231)|
| 2:33:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| Did you say $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| I couldn't hear you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9240)|
| 2:34:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| Their membership fee is $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| For 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| For 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| It doesn't say what the price is above 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| But what really will get them is when they do a brush fire or a structure fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| you're talking $2,000 for the first hour for the first engine, then $1,000 per engine after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9255)|
| 2:34:21| I mean, that rate structure is pretty heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9261)|
| 2:34:24| A couple of questions, Dwight, if you can get before next week is it says down here that they bill for these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9264)|
| 2:34:33| First of all, I'd like to ask them to come and see if they do bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| And if they do not get paid, do they put lanes on properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| Or if they do even have a structure to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| Some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Seymour don't because it's not cost effective, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| Next thing is we're talking about how much money they make or they raised last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9291)|
| 2:34:58| Can you ask them if they have their 2019 990 yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| That will be more up to date than what you had sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9301)|
| 2:35:05| So those are two of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| And, yeah, you and I discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| I'm for fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| I'm for really fire protection is not what they do anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| It's basically 80% or plus is medical calls, car crash calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| It's not really fire related structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| But I would love to see them to change their website that says that they don't take taxpayers money when actually they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9325)|
| 2:35:34| Mr. VandeVate, do you have anything to add to that discussion at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| Mr. Chairman, if I could, just a couple of things that I think would ask the body to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9338)|
| 2:35:43| And apologies for the benefit of the new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| Dwight VandeVate, 400 West Main Avenue, Suite 630, Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| In follow up to what Commissioner Hill mentioned, I would ask that if this commission would continue to let the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee do its work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9353)|
| 2:36:02| we will have a set of recommendations to the mayor, with any luck, by the end of the calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9362)|
| 2:36:08| And those will then come to this commission in the form of a request for extended funding for these agencies for the balance of FY21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9368)|
| 2:36:16| So the committee is hard at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| We have been pulling data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| We will continue to work and keep you posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| But if we could have that opportunity to come back to this body, along with our recommendations that we've made to the mayor in December, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9383)|
| 2:36:32| Two, I would encourage this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| The only difference here is that the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department were funded in the FY21 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9394)|
| 2:36:45| because that's where they were funded last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| Karnes was funded through a designation last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| That's why they are being funded through a designation this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| That $125,000 that is before you for Karnes, you have already approved it for Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9413)|
| 2:36:59| and you've already approved $225,000 for the Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad when you adopted the FY21 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9419)|
| 2:37:06| So those agencies have already been commensurately funded based on the MOUs that we previously discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9426)|
| 2:37:13| And, again, apologies to the new commissioners, because this was all transacted before the four of you were seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| But we're drawing a distinction here between Karnes and Seymour that I think is both ill-timed and unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9439)|
| 2:37:25| They have signed the MOU, just as the other agencies have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| They're simply being funded differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| They're being funded the same way they were last year, because that's how things happen in finance from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9451)|
| 2:37:37| But I think we're drawing a distinction here that's troublesome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| I'd also point out that Karnes operates as a 501c3, just as Seymour does, and 501c3s have various ways of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9461)|
| 2:37:51| Chief Linson Bigler at Seymour is an inveterate fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| Seymour is very successful at raising funds through capital donations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| Karnes has a subscription model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| Rural Metro has a subscription model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| They all have to do what they do in order to be financially viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| Again, the difference with Seymour and Karnes from Rural Metro is they are 501c3s, and obviously Rural Metro is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| But I just encourage this body to give our committee an opportunity to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| And again, Karnes isn't being favored here or treated any differently than the other agencies that this body has previously discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9500)|
| 2:38:28| and that this committee has previously spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| Thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| Commissioner Bussle, do you want to stay on the subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Yes, I want to stay on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| Commissioner Bussle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9521)|
| 2:38:44| You're talking about volunteer fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| They supplement their income by being a first responder for AMR, and those charges are a lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9527)|
| 2:38:54| So with them just saying what we're giving them helps them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9534)|
| 2:38:57| they make a lot more money as responding to first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| to make sure that AMR meets their deadlines to get to their accidents or when they're called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9542)|
| 2:39:11| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| In my neighborhood the other night, my next-door neighbor walks his dog, or rather his dog walks him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| and his dog got him tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| And I found my neighbor in the street that was bleeding from the head, knocked himself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9561)|
| 2:39:29| And so his wife called, and I let his wife know what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| But anyway, we called the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| We needed a transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| We got a fire truck that showed up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9578)|
| 2:39:43| And about 15 minutes later we had an ambulance got hit for two bills, fire truck and ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9583)|
| 2:39:52| And they're not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| So if you're worried about funding about these, they make their money off of the emergency run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9594)|
| 2:40:01| So does the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| They go as a first responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| So your health insurance pays for that, and they pay dearly for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| So if you're worried about funding for them, I wouldn't be worried that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| because they make money someplace else a lot more than you think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| Thank you, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| So we are still on Item 48, talking about designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9620)|
| 2:40:23| We have talked a lot about Karn's Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| Commissioner Smith, did you want to stay on the same resolution and pivot to a new topic on the designations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| or a totally different thing altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| Pivot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| Pivot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| Commissioner Smith, pivot away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| Please bring your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| The $1.6 million for one-time pay adjustments, that is not being issued right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9645)|
| 2:40:55| There will have to be another resolution that comes before us that just goes to the general fund for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9655)|
| 2:41:01| No, they're going now, because you're appropriating those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| What we have said about these designations are simply this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9665)|
| 2:41:11| We're very much taking a cautious look for the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| We're adhering to what the state says and to see how things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| How we view it as is anything on this designation list, especially that one in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9683)|
| 2:41:30| we like to reserve the right to adjust that one-time pay adjustment if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9690)|
| 2:41:40| I guess let me shorten this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| Okay, buddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9704)|
| 2:41:45| The reason why I'm asking is this is not a, for me personally being a county employee, this is not an overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9705)|
| 2:41:53| And I don't want to be any part of voting myself something if this isn't going to come back before us where I can abstain at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9713)|
| 2:42:00| It will not come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| Designations are appropriated in 21 as the resolution states, and so you're probably best to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9722)|
| 2:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| Second question, and this is not, it's back to the county commission discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| I think John had maybe a correction on the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| I'm fine with going ahead and doing this, but I would like to see us do our rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9743)|
| 2:42:28| make some kind of change to where we don't wind up in this position constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| Anytime we have somebody change office where somebody burns down those funds before the new person comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| maybe our rules committee could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| I know, Commissioner Buster, when you first came in, you had nothing, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| And I don't believe we at that time upped you back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| You asked if I would do that, and I'm going to respond to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| It was my feeling that my district had already got those discretionary funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9775)|
| 2:43:03| and it would have been unfair for my district to get another amount of funds to go back in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9783)|
| 2:43:10| And the person that did that just really messed up, you know, messes you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| If somebody's taking your funds, that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| But what I'm thinking we should do is come to the rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9797)|
| 2:43:21| and if you are an election cycle year, you're allowed to spend up to two twelfths until after the new person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9801)|
| 2:43:27| or you are re-seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| You know, if there is some kind of emergency in your district, you can always come before this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9809)|
| 2:43:34| I mean this body with a resolution, asking for the rules to be suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| But I think that would be a fairer way instead of just every time we have an election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| I mean, we're setting the precedent for people to just empty that funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| and then that district's going to get a reload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| And if I have heard you correctly, when this vote comes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| as a Knox County employee, you wish to abstain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9838)|
| 2:43:59| As do I, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9841)|
| 2:44:02| Is there any more discussions about item number 48 that's properly before us with a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| Excuse me, a motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| All in favor to move forward with no recommendation, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9850)|

| 2:44:20| Item number 49, resolution 806, is approving and authorizing the acceptance of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9860)|
| 2:44:25| from various sources in the fiscal year 2019 through 2020 Knox County budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9865)|

| 2:44:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9883)|
| 2:44:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9885)|

| 2:44:58| Would you also please read 54 as a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| It's resolution 904, approving the services agreement with Symmetra Life Insurance Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9904)|
| 2:45:10| to provide group life insurance for Knox County government and Knox County schools employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9910)|

| 2:45:16| I'll make the motion to move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9916)|
| 2:45:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9919)|

| 2:45:25| Item number 54, resolution 904, is approving the third amendment to the client services agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| I'll make the motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| I'll actually make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| On both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| On both items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| Since it's a benefit thing, do we need to do two separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| I'm just moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| I just pulled it for informational purposes, not for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| I'm pretty sure that I can make a motion for both of them to move forward or to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9950)|
| 2:45:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9957)|
| 2:45:59| I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9959)|
| 2:46:00| You originally had it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| I pulled it from consent for informational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| Put it back on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| So, I'm going to make a motion to move 53 and 54 for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9972)|
| 2:46:16| Commissioner Hill, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| Did you second both of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| I actually seconded 53, but I'm happy to second both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9983)|
| 2:46:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| So, Jay and Hill on the first and second for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| And I pulled this specifically to introduce Stephanie Chandler, who is the new director of Knox County Benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=9994)|
| 2:46:42| for an opportunity to introduce herself and tell us about the amazing savings that she has found, Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10002)|
| 2:46:50| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| Stephanie Chandler, Knox County Benefits Director, 400 Main Street, Suite 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| This is my first commission meeting as well, so we'll do this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| These two contracts I actually inherited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| I took over the department July 1st, but I was involved from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| We had a crossroads at the beginning of this year when we typically procure these types of contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10031)|
| 2:47:17| and had to make some pretty heavy decisions in light of an uncertain environment in health care, insurance, benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10037)|
| 2:47:25| and really weigh all of our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| We went forward with a renewal for Optum Item 53 because those are very complex contracts to procure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10048)|
| 2:47:38| They're highly involved as far as negotiations go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| There's a lot of back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| It took us the better part of a year to even get to a point where even with a renewal we just agreed on terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10064)|
| 2:47:51| and there's a high dollar amount involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| So for the sake of less disruption for members, more savings for Knox County, we went with a renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10074)|
| 2:48:01| which is offering us three years of guaranteed pricing with just over $3.3 million in savings over the course of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10081)|
| 2:48:12| So we're right at over $1 million each year that we renew with them, and that's guaranteed pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10092)|
| 2:48:19| We still have the option to put this out to bid if we're not happy with the service as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| so it made more sense to go with the contract that provided better savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| And then life insurance, alternatively Item 54, is more of a cookie-cutter plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10108)|
| 2:48:35| There's a lot less negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| We still went back and forth on whether to renew with our current carrier because of COVID or put it out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| Because we had a little more time and ability, we figured it couldn't hurt to see what came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| and so our benefit advisors actually also acted as a resource for us to do that and came back with significant savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10130)|
| 2:49:01| a better plan, a better company that's offering us more than our current company did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10141)|
| 2:49:07| and we're at a period contract of $426,000 in annual premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10147)|
| 2:49:15| We've got more coverage options with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10155)|
| 2:49:18| We have a longer pricing guarantee, savings on both basic and supplemental life insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10158)|
| 2:49:25| which means members actually pay a little bit more and get more premium offerings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10165)|
| 2:49:30| That one was really a no-brainer, and we had several competitive bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10170)|
| 2:49:35| but Symetra came back as the company that offered us the greatest savings with the most rich plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| Well, I want to commend you and your team on tremendous savings for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| Is there any further discussion or questions of this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| Thank you for being with us tonight and sticking through it to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10190)|

| 2:50:48| I'll say motion to approve, but I may be told that's not how we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10248)|

| 2:50:53| Motion to approve by Commissioner Beeler, seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| Discussion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10257)|
| 2:51:01| Anybody want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10261)|
| 2:51:02| Not please, but is there a discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| Well, I was going to say that the Knox County Clerk, who's still here, and the Sheriff was here for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| and the trustee, oh, the Sheriff's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| Oh, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| Okay, and the trustee was here for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| So any comments from Director of Finance or any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| Just when are we going to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10283)|
| 2:51:35| I am proud to, I'm Sherry Witt, the Clerk for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| and I'm proud to announce that we're hoping to get moved this week and have an official opening on October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10298)|
| 2:51:47| So please come and see the new East Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| It's a combined service with the trustee and the Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| and given the citizens of East Knoxville, that presence of the Sheriff's Department out there has been very comforting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10315)|
| 2:52:03| and we're getting a lot of feedback on it, and we're very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| And the good thing is you all get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10327)|
| 2:52:10| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10332)|
| 2:52:13| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| It's a proper motion before us to approve from Commissioner Beeler with the second Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10344)|

| 2:52:30| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10350)|
| 2:52:48| 907, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10368)|
| 2:52:54| We will, hold on, let me find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| We're going to continue up, we're going to finish our resolutions before we go into ordinances and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10378)|
| 2:53:03| One of the items that was added is Resolution 907, and that was one that we added to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10383)|
| 2:53:10| and we will add that, we will move that up to this spot, 56A, if you will, but it's going to go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10390)|
| 2:53:17| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10397)|
| 2:53:18| Okay, it's Resolution R-20-9-907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| It's regarding Knox County policies related to regulations of the Knox County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| and executive orders of Governor Lee and the Tennessee Department of Health addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10407)|
| 2:53:34| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10414)|
| 2:53:41| I'm still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10421)|
| 2:53:42| Motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| Motion to approve by Commissioner Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10428)|
| 2:53:49| Second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| Is there a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| Commissioner Beeler, would you start us off, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10437)|
| 2:54:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| I have a question for Mr. Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10445)|
| 2:54:12| Can the duties of the Board of Health be altered or diminished by the County Commission with regard to TCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10452)|
| 2:54:30| Well, this resolution is not diminishing what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| It creates a potential conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| It's stating, if passed, that this is what Knox County and its citizens want as opposed to the dictates of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10477)|
| 2:54:52| And if you read the entire resolution, it's got references from the Federal District Court up in Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10492)|
| 2:55:02| which shows the problems you have with a non-elected type of board putting down dictates to the citizens as opposed to the elected things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10502)|
| 2:55:15| And I'll throw in, because the question will probably come, there's another statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| It's kind of redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| It's a hard statute to read and understand because the first thing it says is the Board of Health will just administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10523)|
| 2:55:30| and enforce the Tennessee Department of Health restrictions, which come down through the elected governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10530)|
| 2:55:39| But what is, if they were to be gotten rid of, the health director, Dr. Buchanan, has all those powers anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10539)|
| 2:55:50| She can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| She can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| She's got powers for threatened, all sorts of threatened health things in the county, and she has that authority anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10553)|
| 2:56:04| It's kind of a redundant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| And, of course, the difference is that she, as the health director, is directly responsible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10566)|
| 2:56:14| and answers directly to the elected mayor, so there's that electoral process that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10574)|
| 2:56:21| There are a lot of other things, and I'm sure you'll have other questions, and I'll be glad to answer them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10581)|
| 2:56:26| but this really doesn't take away whatever powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10586)|
| 2:56:29| It comes down to how are they going to be enforced, and they turn it into a criminal offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10589)|
| 2:56:38| And there's reluctance, as I have gathered and read in the paper, there's a reluctance for the law enforcement authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10598)|
| 2:56:47| and the district attorney, since it's a state offense, the district attorney would have to prosecute them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10607)|
| 2:56:53| The law enforcement people would have to arrest or cite people that they saw in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10613)|
| 2:57:00| and there's not a sense I've gotten that that's what people want to be arrested or cited to a criminal offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10620)|
| 2:57:09| for not wearing a mask, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| So those are some of the issues, and the constitutional issues were brought out by that gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| I couldn't remember his name, the lawyer that was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| Tremendous constitutional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| We've dodged one lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| We've got another one going right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| You've got the letter from Greg Isaacs, who's a very competent attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| which indicates that he would, if there's going to be closures of businesses and bars and restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10653)|
| 2:57:40| he's prepared to bring a suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| Another point that that attorney made that he's been there, he said these are what they call Section 1983 lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10664)|
| 2:57:51| So you get, if a business prevails in a lawsuit because they got closed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| they get damages in the way of what their lost profits are plus, and this is the kicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| the attorney gets attorney's fees, and I have never seen a 1983 lawsuit in federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10683)|
| 2:58:10| in which the attorney didn't get less than a quarter million dollars even if the whole judgment was 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10690)|
| 2:58:17| I mean, it's a devastating thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| Having said that, whatever, and the county's the one that will get sued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10700)|
| 2:58:26| whatever this board does or this commission or whatever the Board of Health does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| the county's the one that's going to get sued, we will vigorously defend whatever the Board of Health does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10710)|
| 2:58:37| if there's a suit because of that or whatever you do, we'll vigorously defend the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| That's just a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| Now, if you could get back if that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| It helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10727)|
| 2:58:48| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| So because, you know, we're a home rule county, I have not read the charter as it relates to the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10730)|
| 2:58:59| but could the health board be dissolved by ordinance or resolution or would it require a charter amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10739)|
| 2:59:08| No, they're not in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| They were created by ordinance, and they could be gotten rid of by an ordinance with two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10750)|
| 2:59:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| Commissioner Wheeler, Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10759)|
| 2:59:22| Mr. Law Director, you prepared this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10766)|
| 2:59:27| I prepared it after separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| They weren't together, but I had the mayor and Commissioner Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| and Commissioner Ward independently talking to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| They all had different type of concerns, and they all wanted some sort of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| What I've tried to do in preparing this was rely on some existing law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10785)|
| 2:59:50| and trying to meld it into one resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| After the comments tonight, especially the lawyer, I don't remember his name either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10794)|
| 2:59:58| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| Anybody remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| Mr. Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| Fox, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10802)|
| 3:00:03| His comments, are we, do you think that we're good to go on this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| We're going to get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10809)|
| 3:00:10| It doesn't, one way or the other, we'll be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| But do you feel confident still after all the comments tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10813)|
| 3:00:16| I will stand by what my predecessor and I have said all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10816)|
| 3:00:22| If you stand by what the governor has put forth in his executive orders, we're safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10822)|
| 3:00:32| We can't get sued because that's an executive order we're following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| and the suit would have to be brought against the state of Tennessee and not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10836)|
| 3:00:40| I still feel very strongly about that, and that takes away that source of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10840)|
| 3:00:49| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| My concerns about this, let me just start out by saying we heard a lot of talk tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10857)|
| 3:01:03| about people dissolving the Board of Health and getting rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10863)|
| 3:01:08| A lot of our speakers were speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10868)|
| 3:01:11| I'm not sure that they maybe recognize that this resolution does not suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10871)|
| 3:01:20| It has nothing to do with doing away with the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10880)|
| 3:01:27| So I hope some of them that were here earlier will hear that that was not in this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10887)|
| 3:01:36| A couple of concerns that I have, while I have struggled, as many of us have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10896)|
| 3:01:47| with the recommendations that the Board of Health has made, especially relating to our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10907)|
| 3:01:57| and let me be clear, I've not been happy with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| It truly, I think it does come down to civil liberties and to your own civil liberties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10922)|
| 3:02:12| Having said that, I do appreciate the fact that we are a county that has been given some autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10932)|
| 3:02:26| We have the ability to go above and beyond an executive order that's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10946)|
| 3:02:37| I don't know that maybe what we've done to this point has necessarily been the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10957)|
| 3:02:44| that we just kind of need to put that aside and recognize that if we pass this as it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10964)|
| 3:02:54| that if Knox County were to come into a situation where, heaven forbid, we just had a huge spike again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10974)|
| 3:03:09| we might in fact come to a place where more recommendations would need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10989)|
| 3:03:19| above and beyond what the governor has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| I hate to lose the ability to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| Now, what I would support, and I am going to talk to the law director a little more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11006)|
| 3:03:33| is a substitute motion on this number two, stating that any, something to the effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11013)|
| 3:03:45| because again, this is a workshop, we're just talking here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| Something to the effect that any recommendations that the Board of Health makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11029)|
| 3:03:55| that go beyond what the executive order states need to be approved or decided by perhaps our mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11035)|
| 3:04:09| so that we don't totally give up our autonomy as a government that has right now the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11049)|
| 3:04:19| to choose to rule differently than the rest of the state if in fact it meets our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11059)|
| 3:04:26| I think that's real important that we hang on to that piece somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11066)|
| 3:04:32| And I'm certainly open to any modification in this substitute motion that I'm going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11072)|
| 3:04:40| but the way it stands right now, as much as I have not been happy with what we have been forced to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11080)|
| 3:04:52| I believe that hanging on to the ability to have someone else besides the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11092)|
| 3:05:01| be able to make the final decision, which we can wrap into this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11101)|
| 3:05:06| might be very beneficial to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11106)|
| 3:05:11| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| I'm going to next call on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| I have some questions myself I would like to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| and then I will go to Commissioner Bussler and Durrett thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| I'd like to respond to Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11122)|
| 3:05:27| Mr. Book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11127)|
| 3:05:28| What the executive order said was, and you're exactly right, that the six counties that he pulled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11128)|
| 3:05:35| he doesn't talk about their Boards of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| He just said these six counties, and we're one of the six counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11138)|
| 3:05:42| and I have a problem with that, but we won't get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11142)|
| 3:05:46| shall have the authority, the county shall have the authority to issue additional orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| or measures related to the containment or management of the spread of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11150)|
| 3:05:55| which may permit to a greater degree or restrict to a greater degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| the opening, closure, or operation of businesses, organizations, or venues in those counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11160)|
| 3:06:05| The way I read that is that he doesn't say the Board of Health or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11165)|
| 3:06:12| He says that the county shall have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| I take that as being who has the authority in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| It's the elected commission and the elected mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11179)|
| 3:06:24| Do you want to do a quick rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| Well, not a rebuttal, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11186)|
| 3:06:29| Yes, if that be the case then, have we not done due diligence by sitting back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11189)|
| 3:06:36| and allowing the Board of Health to put these regulations on the whole county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11196)|
| 3:06:43| I don't think it's that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| I think this is so complex, and I have spent hours and hours and been up at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11205)|
| 3:06:51| and awakened at night trying to figure out what it all means legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11211)|
| 3:06:57| and so no, I wouldn't expect you to have, this commission to have done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11217)|
| 3:07:02| or the mayor to have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| I'm giving you this after several months and struggling with exact wording on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11224)|
| 3:07:10| so you can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| But that's what the governor said in his executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11233)|
| 3:07:17| He gave the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| And also, as I pointed out, regardless of whether you have the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11239)|
| 3:07:24| Dr. Buchanan has virtually that same authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| She, however, answers to an elected mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| And so that was always my thing, how somebody that wasn't elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| had no accountability could call the shots on businesses and closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| and that bothered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11261)|
| 3:07:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11262)|
| 3:07:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| Good dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11264)|
| 3:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11265)|
| 3:07:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| I'm trying to digest all this because it is a very complex thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11270)|
| 3:07:56| Mr. Law Director, are we basically passing a symbolic gesture here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11276)|
| 3:08:00| that has no real teeth as a resolution does not supersede a state statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| And would we be able to do it through resolution, what Commissioner Hill is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11286)|
| 3:08:13| or would it need to be done through ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| I think it would have to be done, what Commissioner Hill is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| could be done by ordinance if you take that interpretation that I just gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11301)|
| 3:08:28| I don't think that this resolution as it is takes away any power of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| It just says this is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11314)|
| 3:08:37| Neither the Board of Health, in its present thing, the Board of Health has criminal sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11317)|
| 3:08:43| As a practical matter, are those going to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| I don't know that this commission may want to put criminal sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| Then you've got to get the law enforcement people to arrest and prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11330)|
| 3:08:55| That doesn't seem to be the sense of what this county wants to do at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11335)|
| 3:08:59| but that's not for me to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| That's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| But does it give us any liability protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| Say again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| Does it give us any liability protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| I don't see any liability at all if we just follow and we do what the Governor says here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11351)|
| 3:09:19| and follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| I know this Board of Health dissolution is not part of this in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11363)|
| 3:09:28| but if this Board were to get rid of it, you've still got the backup of the county health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11368)|
| 3:09:34| Dr. Buchanan and her county health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11374)|
| 3:09:38| So, no, I don't see any liability whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11381)|
| 3:09:42| In passing this, does it relieve us of any liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| I can't quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11386)|
| 3:09:47| In passing this, does it relieve us of any liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11387)|
| 3:09:51| Yeah, I think it relieves us of a big deal of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| I think it takes off what looked to me, at any rate, as being arbitrary closures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11395)|
| 3:10:03| and that's what the federal district court said in that most recent case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11403)|
| 3:10:09| But my follow-up to that is, does a resolution passed by commission strip the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11409)|
| 3:10:18| from their state statute-given authority to make those restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| They can make the restrictions, but if they are not enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| if a business doesn't follow it and there's no enforcement in there of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11427)|
| 3:10:33| then there's not going to be any liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| Because nobody, if, let's say, a business says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| I'm not going to close down at 10 o'clock, and they stay open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| okay, if they violated the regulation, somebody's got to charge them criminally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11443)|
| 3:10:49| and it's got to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| If they stay open in violation of the thing, there's no damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11452)|
| 3:10:56| So I think the liability issue is done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11456)|
| 3:11:02| So I'll go back to my original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11462)|
| 3:11:05| It's a symbolic gesture that reduces liability for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11465)|
| 3:11:09| but in no way diminishes the authority of the Knox County Health Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| That's a good way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11474)|
| 3:11:16| Okay, so for us to have any of what some people in our community are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11476)|
| 3:11:23| an elected official in a position to work with the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11483)|
| 3:11:31| we would need to possibly do something like Commissioner Hill is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11491)|
| 3:11:36| in an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11496)|
| 3:11:38| Well, I think you can do it by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11498)|
| 3:11:40| I mean, the ordinance is the only reason you need an ordinance would be to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| rid of the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| But to do what Commissioner Hill said you could do by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| I have a couple of questions before I call on Commissioners Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11515)|
| 3:11:58| Durrett, Ward, and Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| Dr. Buchanan, if I could ask you a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11521)|
| 3:12:21| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11541)|
| 3:12:24| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| I just want to sort of talk about the authority of what you have as a public health officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11547)|
| 3:12:32| versus what the Board of Health has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| Do you indeed have the same powers as the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| or are they different in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| I'm going to disagree with our law director based on the advice they gave me previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11561)|
| 3:12:47| The difference between what I can do and what the Board of Health can do is that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| according to the law office, don't have the ability to set policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| The Board can set policy, and I can only set policy through the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11576)|
| 3:13:01| and that's the difference that was explained to me by Mr. Buch's predecessor and Mr. Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| I do have some authorities to close things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| I have some authorities to make people take their medicines and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11590)|
| 3:13:16| and can go before the court and petition the court for orders to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11596)|
| 3:13:21| But those are in cases where we already know that there's an outbreak of disease X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11601)|
| 3:13:28| whatever it is, COVID or whatever else, in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11608)|
| 3:13:32| Then I have the authority to go and say that they need to close down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11612)|
| 3:13:36| As the health director, there's a little more leeway in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11616)|
| 3:13:38| just to have the suspicion or concern that there could be the possibility of somebody getting sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11618)|
| 3:13:44| to be able to close a specific facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11624)|
| 3:13:48| But to be able to set policy and say somebody, you know, certain places can open or close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11628)|
| 3:13:54| or certain places have to open or close at a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| it was my understanding from the law department that I, as the health director or health officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11637)|
| 3:14:02| do not have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| Was that – there was a transition time at the beginning of this pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11644)|
| 3:14:09| and our reaction to it in which you, in consultation with several people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11649)|
| 3:14:14| were making those decisions, and I believe the law department said you need –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11654)|
| 3:14:19| the Board of Health is the one that is sort of the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| Is that kind of when that direction came of it can't just be you, it needs to be them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11661)|
| 3:14:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11669)|
| 3:14:34| That's the only question I have for you, but I have a couple other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11674)|
| 3:14:38| Director Buch, the governor – TCA code gives the legal authority –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11678)|
| 3:14:47| the state law gives legal authority in pretty clear terms to the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11687)|
| 3:14:52| what they can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| And even the executive order acknowledges the counties that have a particular health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11695)|
| 3:15:05| that's different than all others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| The way I read this resolution, it essentially says we choose not to comply with the ability that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11707)|
| 3:15:15| I mean, they have a set of powers created by state law that allow them to exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11715)|
| 3:15:20| allow them to cite, make policy, do things that were just discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11720)|
| 3:15:25| And the way I read this is we don't – thanks for your state law, but no thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11725)|
| 3:15:31| We don't really want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| And that seems to be – every single time we've ever had this discussion that I've been around has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11732)|
| 3:15:37| state law always supersedes local ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| If the state says you can't – can or can't do something, it doesn't matter what you happen on a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11740)|
| 3:15:45| But why am I – what am I not connecting the dots on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| I think what you're – what we're talking about is not taking away what powers they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11749)|
| 3:15:54| It's getting – this is the essence of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11754)|
| 3:16:00| The strict regulations you are doing, I'm not – nothing in here says that you can't do it, Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11760)|
| 3:16:06| This is like saying, like, when you go to the legislature, we know, as Mr. Schoonmaker knows, you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11766)|
| 3:16:14| we come up with a resolution asking the state legislature to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| because that's the sense of this commission on behalf of its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11778)|
| 3:16:23| That's what this resolution does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| It doesn't take away their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11785)|
| 3:16:26| It just says this is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11786)|
| 3:16:27| But number two says –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| I know what it says, but what I already – I already related that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11788)|
| 3:16:32| I said that's a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| That creates a conflict of what the desire of this commission in Knox County is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11794)|
| 3:16:40| and what the Board of Health is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11800)|
| 3:16:44| It doesn't take away their power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| They've got the power to do that, but it's how does it get enforced if it does get enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| I guess I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| I guess the part of me that's struggling is number two says, you know, it should be limited and controlled by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11813)|
| 3:17:01| So it's saying you shouldn't act the way that you're legally able to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11821)|
| 3:17:06| But number three is more, I think, more difficult for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11826)|
| 3:17:11| We're saying even though there is a legal and lawful order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11831)|
| 3:17:15| we are going to choose to not follow that order in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11835)|
| 3:17:21| This is the commission saying to our law enforcement and our prosecutors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11841)|
| 3:17:26| even if it's a lawful order, we choose not to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11846)|
| 3:17:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| Shall be the policy not to arrest, cite, or criminally prosecute for failure to comply with an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11851)|
| 3:17:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| So that is saying we are saying to our – we are saying we don't want to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11860)|
| 3:17:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| I'm saying that we don't want to arrest little old ladies on the street that aren't wearing their mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11866)|
| 3:17:51| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11871)|
| 3:17:52| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11872)|
| 3:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11873)|
| 3:17:54| Let's just say the strict – right now there is literally no enforcement whatsoever right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11877)|
| 3:17:58| Let's just assume there's a mask mandate and the mask mandate says that you must wear a mask in a public building or be fined $50 or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11878)|
| 3:18:08| Or go to jail for 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| Or go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11890)|
| 3:18:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11891)|
| 3:18:12| That is absolutely – like the sheriff's officers in the back are looking and going, okay, we're going to cite you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11892)|
| 3:18:18| We're saying by passing this we would be saying we don't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| We don't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11903)|
| 3:18:24| We don't want you to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| It's not saying they can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11906)|
| 3:18:27| It's saying we don't want you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11909)|
| 3:18:30| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11910)|
| 3:18:31| Thank you for the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11911)|
| 3:18:32| Then I think it's very important for us to say this out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| This resolution says if we pass it, we are saying we don't want to tell our law enforcement to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11915)|
| 3:18:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11924)|
| 3:18:45| We have no authority to tell the sheriff what he can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| We don't want them to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11928)|
| 3:18:50| This says we don't tell them what to do, but we're saying as a commission we don't want them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11930)|
| 3:18:57| We don't want you to be out arresting and prosecuting our citizens if they don't wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11937)|
| 3:19:03| That's basically what this is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11943)|
| 3:19:05| Could that also be translated to another resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11945)|
| 3:19:08| You can change the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11948)|
| 3:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11949)|
| 3:19:10| Could that also apply to another resolution then, taking it further to say Tennessee state law as under the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11950)|
| 3:19:21| or the Health Department mandates child safety laws or for safety restraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11961)|
| 3:19:28| and you must have a child in a safety seat per the direction of the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11968)|
| 3:19:34| and the law that says child must be in a safety seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11974)|
| 3:19:38| But by that precedence, we could put another resolution saying we don't want you to cite anybody that doesn't have your kid in a car seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11978)|
| 3:19:48| You can take an odd absurdum all you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11988)|
| 3:19:52| All this was trying to express what two commissioners and the mayor felt about innocent citizens in this terrible situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=11992)|
| 3:20:01| This is just suggestive language I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12001)|
| 3:20:04| You can change it, not adopt it or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12004)|
| 3:20:07| But the main concern I have as a lawyer is the stuff that's being done now is subjecting this county and its taxpayers to lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12007)|
| 3:20:17| That's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| And regardless of what the Board of Health wants to do under what the statute says, if it's an unconstitutional action, we've got a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12019)|
| 3:20:30| And that's my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12032)|
| 3:20:33| One just last comment, and then I'm going to move on to – I'll stop talking and I'll move on to other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12033)|
| 3:20:38| I just – it's a precedence we're thinking about setting, and this is certainly an upside-down year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12038)|
| 3:20:47| What's up is down and left is right, and it's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| The same voices that I always hear say there are the federal government, don't tell me what to do, we have states' rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12050)|
| 3:20:57| and state law, don't tell me what to do, we have local home rule in our lone local charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12057)|
| 3:21:02| are now saying we don't want to have our own decisions, state, tell us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12062)|
| 3:21:08| And the same people that continuously argued all summer long that 94 – 90-some – a majority of other counties don't have a law director –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12068)|
| 3:21:20| that elected a law director, but we should be different, are now saying we shouldn't be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12080)|
| 3:21:25| we should be just like everybody else because it works everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| And it's a totally backwards world, and I just – it's – I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12088)|
| 3:21:33| Commissioner Buffett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12093)|
| 3:21:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| It sounds like that we didn't hear what those people were saying to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12098)|
| 3:21:45| We didn't hear it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12105)|
| 3:21:48| We've got certain things in our mind that we think that we're going to shut down the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12108)|
| 3:21:53| but what the people were telling us, we have three issues, not just one, not just coronavirus, you know, 19, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12113)|
| 3:22:02| we have three issues that we missed altogether that we don't address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12122)|
| 3:22:07| One is the physical health, one is mental health, and one is economic health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| They all three go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| But what the health department is doing, like what Chairman Jay is trying to say, is law, and they're talking about policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12133)|
| 3:22:21| Is that not right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| They're talking about policy, not law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| And the people want something to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| But if you really ask, has we been really given the science and the data to say coronavirus stops at 10 or after 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12151)|
| 3:22:43| whatever it is where they change that, do we have any scientific knowledge that that has happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12163)|
| 3:22:49| They're just making kind of an arbitrary saying to us that that's what they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12169)|
| 3:22:56| that it will stop 60 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent by doing that, but it also hurts the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12176)|
| 3:23:03| And if you really look at it, all three of these things that they were telling us, it's what we've got to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12183)|
| 3:23:09| But we're considering one little piece of it, the virus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12189)|
| 3:23:15| When that goes away, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12195)|
| 3:23:16| We're still an economic problem, and we've still got the mental health issue we've got to deal with that you can't take a drug for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12196)|
| 3:23:25| So let's look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12205)|
| 3:23:26| Let's deal with the issue, the whole issue, not just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12206)|
| 3:23:31| And if we need to add something to this to say we need to deal with all three, let's do that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| It's not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| My goodness, it's just a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12218)|
| 3:23:41| And they want us to enforce a law over a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12221)|
| 3:23:45| And this committee deals with policies and laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12225)|
| 3:23:49| So let's get off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| Let's go back and decide what we're going to do with this whole problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| And it is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| So we're just beating a dead horse to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12238)|
| 3:24:02| I mean, we just keep beating on it, beating on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12242)|
| 3:24:05| And it's never going to improve until we give a policy that the people can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| And they came to us and asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| And look where we're at right now, arguing over a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12253)|
| 3:24:18| My gosh, it's not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12258)|
| 3:24:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| Thank you, Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12262)|
| 3:24:24| Senator Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12266)|
| 3:24:28| I have several, a few concerns regarding the way this resolution is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12268)|
| 3:24:34| One is, you know, I heard, I did listen to what the people were saying today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12274)|
| 3:24:40| And I heard them say that part of their issue is the fact that this is an unelected board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| It's an appointed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| But we have a lot of appointed boards that also make policy, not necessarily laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12287)|
| 3:24:52| but do make policies that we do follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| For example, the Board of Zoning Appeals is an appointed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12295)|
| 3:24:59| Our Surgeon General for the United States is appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12299)|
| 3:25:04| He has a warning label on all cigarettes on the potential effects that they could have if you were to take up smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12304)|
| 3:25:14| So, again, I just wanted to have that on record that it's not every, every policy is made by an elected board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12314)|
| 3:25:25| And I do feel like that to kind of talk about Commissioner Hill's adjustment to number two, have it be approved by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12325)|
| 3:25:35| I don't know that that's the route to go as well because the mayor himself is on the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12335)|
| 3:25:41| So kind of, I don't know if I need to make a substitute on a substitute, but just the thought would be to have it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12341)|
| 3:25:49| If we're going to go that route, my compromise would be to have it approved by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12349)|
| 3:25:55| Since we are more of a representation of Knox County, there's more of us rather than it be one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12355)|
| 3:26:04| Thank you, Ms. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12364)|
| 3:26:05| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| So I was the original requester, and then I found out later that Commissioner Biggs was also working on legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12367)|
| 3:26:14| So my original intent for what this was and what everybody took it and ran in a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12374)|
| 3:26:20| so when I talked to the law director, him and I were discussing the liability of what the county is coming under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12380)|
| 3:26:28| So I want to protect the county and the citizens and the taxpayers to reduce the amount of liability that we have as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12388)|
| 3:26:36| So this way we're not getting sued left and right for decisions that an appointed board has made and that we're living with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12396)|
| 3:26:43| Now the board can still make appointed things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| I have nothing against the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| I was simply having the intent of covering ourself so that we are not going to get sued left and right for decisions that we as an elected body are not making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12407)|
| 3:26:58| So my intent in this whole process was to legally, liability-wise, cover us in some sort of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12418)|
| 3:27:08| And this was the best way that I saw fit to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| It was then taken by several people and ran in a different direction that this is an end-all, be-all thing that's going to get rid of the health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12432)|
| 3:27:20| and do this and do that, and this person's got this authority now and that person's got that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| There's been, I think, a giant misconstruction of the facts and the intent of what this is really supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12444)|
| 3:27:32| And maybe that's my fault for being quiet the last couple of days and not coming out to the public and speaking, and I'll take that on myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12452)|
| 3:27:39| But we need to protect our citizens from the liability that, you know, nothing against the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12459)|
| 3:27:47| but a board that we appointed because they come before us to get appointed to are making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12467)|
| 3:27:53| And I don't want to have to raise taxes or furlough more county employees just to pay off lawsuits going forward the next couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12473)|
| 3:28:04| That was my original intent for this piece of legislation that I requested the law director to draw up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12484)|
| 3:28:14| And I apologize that it went in a different direction than I intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| I would be open to other resolutions going forward about the health board and all the rest of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12498)|
| 3:28:25| I would request that everybody consider leaving this as it is so that we can legally protect ourselves at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12505)|
| 3:28:32| and we can have a further discussion going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12512)|
| 3:28:35| When I originally talked to the law director, I was of the opinion that there was going to be a different resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12515)|
| 3:28:43| or a different piece of legislation dealing with the should the health board exist, not exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12523)|
| 3:28:50| how the law should be directed and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| This was supposed to be a supplemental thing originally for us to protect ourselves liability-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12533)|
| 3:29:00| It was not supposed to be what people have turned it into tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12540)|
| 3:29:04| So I'll take that on myself, but I'm asking the commission to consider this piece of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12544)|
| 3:29:12| for some lack of better terminology, doesn't have the teeth that some people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12552)|
| 3:29:17| But liability-wise, it covers our butts going forward so that we're not out millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12557)|
| 3:29:25| and having to look to our taxpayers and our citizens to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12565)|
| 3:29:29| hey, you need to bail us out because of what we got ourselves into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12569)|
| 3:29:34| So that was my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12574)|
| 3:29:37| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12577)|
| 3:29:38| Mr. Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12578)|
| 3:29:40| I think Commissioner Beeler is before me, if you want to go ahead and recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12580)|
| 3:29:43| He's already spoken once, and you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| I'd like to go at the end, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12585)|
| 3:29:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12586)|
| 3:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12587)|
| 3:29:48| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12590)|
| 3:29:52| I want to cite just some notes that I made from three of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12592)|
| 3:30:01| The first speaker, I believe Ms. Stafford was her name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12601)|
| 3:30:06| I agree with what she said about the fact that the health board is primarily made up of professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12606)|
| 3:30:13| who are at the top of their field, very qualified individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12613)|
| 3:30:17| who really are just doing what they've been tasked with doing and empowered to do by TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12617)|
| 3:30:23| Don't fault them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| However, I do believe that the health boards have been given far too much unilateral authority to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12625)|
| 3:30:35| really almost without restriction, by TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| And I think that definitely needs to be revisited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12639)|
| 3:30:41| I think the legislature will revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12641)|
| 3:30:46| But Ms. Thomas, I believe was the lady's name, who actually spoke in favor of the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12646)|
| 3:30:52| made a very important comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| She said the job of the health board is health, not business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12654)|
| 3:31:00| And yet, my thought that I wrote down was, yet they are passing mandates that profoundly affect business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12660)|
| 3:31:09| And then the attorney, Mr. Fox, made the statement that taking away the right to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12669)|
| 3:31:14| or do business without just compensation is prohibited by the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12674)|
| 3:31:20| And that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| And so, you know, as I think about this, I think our law director has told us that he believes this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12682)|
| 3:31:31| I know it does not dissolve the health board, and I know that's what some folks are wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12691)|
| 3:31:38| But Mr. Book has said he believes this resolution, as it's written, does give us some liability protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12698)|
| 3:31:47| which, as Commissioner Ward said, was his intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12707)|
| 3:31:51| It is my personal belief and conviction that decisions, even those made in the interest of public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12711)|
| 3:31:58| if they have a profound effect on the economy and on business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12718)|
| 3:32:02| I believe those should be executive and legislative decisions with health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12722)|
| 3:32:08| and maybe others acting in an advisory capacity, but not unilaterally making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12728)|
| 3:32:14| And I believe Mr. Book said, and Mr. Book, I don't want to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12734)|
| 3:32:20| but I believe you indicated that because of the language in there that relates to the governor's executive order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12740)|
| 3:32:31| it actually does empower the county to make executive and legislative decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12751)|
| 3:32:36| So I would say that I can support this resolution as it's written, as Commissioner Ward has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12756)|
| 3:32:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| Thank you, Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12764)|
| 3:32:47| Honoring the request for Commissioner Biggs to be the last to speak, I will then go to Commissioner Schoonmaker and then Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12767)|
| 3:32:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| Director Buchanan, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12777)|
| 3:33:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12790)|
| 3:33:11| Like many of us, we've watched the hours and hours of the Board of Health meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12791)|
| 3:33:17| and I seem to recall that back towards the beginning of the summer that the Board adopted the Tennessee Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12797)|
| 3:33:25| Now, was that just that the Board themselves adopted it, or was that an adoption for all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12805)|
| 3:33:32| or was I not hearing that exactly correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| So the Tennessee Pledge is really just a set of guidelines for businesses for reopening safely during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12816)|
| 3:33:44| They are based on the governor's executive orders and change somewhat based on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12824)|
| 3:33:49| They're not totally always in sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| So the Board did recommend that we follow, as a community, we follow the Tennessee Pledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12832)|
| 3:33:59| but also continue to use the benchmarks that we have to make decisions and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12839)|
| 3:34:09| and set policy for more local action as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12849)|
| 3:34:12| So kind of a little bit of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| Follow the Tennessee Pledge unless there's a regulation that is more strict or different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12854)|
| 3:34:20| then follow that one, a local regulation, which the governor's order allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12860)|
| 3:34:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12865)|
| 3:34:26| So we officially never accepted it as a Knox County entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12866)|
| 3:34:31| This resolution would cover that as item number three or four or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12871)|
| 3:34:36| I've not seen the resolution, Commissioner, so I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| Next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12883)|
| 3:34:44| Is a mask a medical device?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12884)|
| 3:34:47| This cloth face covering that I have on is not a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12887)|
| 3:34:51| There are certain masks that are medical devices, but this mask is not a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12891)|
| 3:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12895)|
| 3:34:56| And, you know, we have this deal where 89 counties are controlled by the State Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12896)|
| 3:35:05| and then in turn controlled by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12905)|
| 3:35:10| Is it possible that Knox County could have its Board of Health controlled by the State of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12910)|
| 3:35:17| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12917)|
| 3:35:20| I'm not sure about how the ordinances and charter would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| We're set up as a separate metropolitan health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| and with that comes certain responsibilities, such as the county can choose to have a Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12929)|
| 3:35:35| I believe, if I remember correctly, if the county doesn't choose to have a Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12935)|
| 3:35:39| the commissioner may create what's called an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12939)|
| 3:35:44| I'm not sure what that board would do, so I'm just not sure if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12944)|
| 3:35:50| We work with but do not report up to the Department of Health at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12950)|
| 3:35:55| I report to the mayor and to the Board of Health, and so we don't report directly up to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12955)|
| 3:36:00| so we are not under their jurisdiction per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| But is it possible that you could be transferred back to the state with legislative approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12963)|
| 3:36:10| the mayor, and then the state fund your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12974)|
| 3:36:16| I think the state would have to be willing to fund that, and I'm not sure they're willing to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12976)|
| 3:36:21| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| And then is it your understanding that because the governor always talks about the 89 counties that are under his jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12985)|
| 3:36:34| and then the six counties that are not, is the reason he always makes that designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12994)|
| 3:36:39| because in his executive orders that he is saying, I control 89, I don't control six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=12999)|
| 3:36:46| so it's up to the six to kind of make their own decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13006)|
| 3:36:50| Right, just like we're a self-rule county, we self-govern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13010)|
| 3:36:54| Public health falls under that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13014)|
| 3:36:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| I'm going to go to Commissioner Hill, who has not had a chance to speak before I come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13019)|
| 3:37:03| Commissioner Ward, assuming that you're still in the deferment phase of your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13023)|
| 3:37:09| Just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13029)|
| 3:37:10| Use your microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| Just briefly, Commissioner Schoonmaker, what you are asking relates back, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13031)|
| 3:37:18| to one of the points I had talked about in the fact that I think we should value our autonomy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13038)|
| 3:37:25| and if something like that could even be worked out, then, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13045)|
| 3:37:30| we would be giving up some control of this county back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13050)|
| 3:37:37| We need to keep government as close to home and to the people as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13057)|
| 3:37:42| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13062)|
| 3:37:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13063)|
| 3:37:44| As far as I understand, I guess what I was going by is the governor in his executive orders for his 89 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13064)|
| 3:37:52| which is probably, I'm going to guess, five and a half million people in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13072)|
| 3:37:58| that he's saying, I want you to do A, B, and C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13078)|
| 3:38:04| and that's what our health officials say that's going to protect you from this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13084)|
| 3:38:10| We, in turn, have taken it, and we've taken A, B, and C, but now we've added D and E on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13090)|
| 3:38:17| which now makes us liable because the state is not going to defend us for these extra things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13097)|
| 3:38:24| So I guess my question is when the governor and the state officials say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13104)|
| 3:38:30| this is good for five and a half million people, why is it not good for 470,000 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13110)|
| 3:38:38| We still have the ability to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| I understand that, but we would have to go by the A, B, and C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13121)|
| 3:38:45| but when we're adding D and E, are we doing overreach, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13125)|
| 3:38:49| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| That's a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13131)|
| 3:38:52| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| One of the things I wanted to bring up going forward is I think we're doing the health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13133)|
| 3:38:59| and the commission and the mayor disservice by not creating some kind of advisory board of medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13139)|
| 3:39:06| that specialize in contagious diseases and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13146)|
| 3:39:10| I think that's something that this commission should explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13150)|
| 3:39:13| Going forward next week or next month that we create a five-person board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13153)|
| 3:39:18| then we try to find the best medical physicians that have the expertise in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13158)|
| 3:39:22| and their sole role is to give advice to this commission, to the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13162)|
| 3:39:26| and to the mayor as experts in the contagious disease field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13166)|
| 3:39:30| I know I'm the new guy and I'm making a little bit of waves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| but I think we're kind of playing from behind at this point and we need to catch up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| and we need to give the health board the resources that they need to make good decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13178)|
| 3:39:44| and let's find the five best people that are experts in that field to advise the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13184)|
| 3:39:50| to advise us as commissioners, and to advise the mayor to make appropriate decisions for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13190)|
| 3:39:56| We have the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13196)|
| 3:39:58| I think we're lacking by not taking up something along those lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13198)|
| 3:40:02| and we're not doing our citizens a service by not finding the best of the best that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13202)|
| 3:40:10| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13211)|
| 3:40:12| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13212)|
| 3:40:14| I want to make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13214)|
| 3:40:16| Number one, I did co-sponsor this, and I appreciate everyone looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13216)|
| 3:40:22| but one of the things that we're not talking about is whenever this very first started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13222)|
| 3:40:28| and I'm sure Dr. Buchanan can attest to this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| that we started looking at the Board of Health because some of these surrounding counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13231)|
| 3:40:36| don't have the amount of hospitals that we do here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13236)|
| 3:40:40| So the mandates were originally founded to lessen the burdens of the health facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13240)|
| 3:40:46| if my memory serves me correctly, and we've done so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13246)|
| 3:40:50| and now I don't feel like the burden that is there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13250)|
| 3:40:53| So whenever I started talking to Director Buch, the main thing that I talked about was doing an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13253)|
| 3:41:00| My main concern was the length that the ordinance was going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13260)|
| 3:41:03| You've got a first reading, a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13263)|
| 3:41:04| This could take 65, 70 days before anything goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| and as we saw Wednesday night, last Wednesday night, we don't even have a mass timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13267)|
| 3:41:13| So I can't, as my friend Brad Anders would say, I can read the tea leaves, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13273)|
| 3:41:22| I can't do that tonight, but what I can do is talk to you guys about what I think needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13282)|
| 3:41:28| and I'm going to make a substitute motion to make an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13288)|
| 3:41:33| that after anything that lasts longer than 30 days pertaining to the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13293)|
| 3:41:43| it has to come before a vote for Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13303)|
| 3:41:47| And if we do that tonight, Law Director Buch, does that mean that the first reading would be Monday night, next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13307)|
| 3:41:54| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13314)|
| 3:41:55| Can you make a substitute motion for an ordinance on a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| Is there two different legal, structural, can't do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13319)|
| 3:42:03| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| Let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13326)|
| 3:42:07| It doesn't say you can or you can't, but it's somewhat questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13327)|
| 3:42:12| So would that be something that I would have to wait until the month of October to make an ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13332)|
| 3:42:18| and then we'd have to go through first and second reading, so it would be about the first of next year before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13338)|
| 3:42:23| Either that or you can, the mayor and or the chairman can call a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13343)|
| 3:42:31| An emergency meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13351)|
| 3:42:32| Either emergency or just a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| I'm just trying to see how we can get where we need to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13356)|
| 3:42:39| because I don't know if this body is understanding the impact this resolution would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13359)|
| 3:42:44| And whenever you and I spoke, the resolution would, as Commissioner Ward said, cover our butts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13364)|
| 3:42:51| And I think that stressing that to, like Commissioner Bussler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| the 200 people that filled the top of the auditorium so they can understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13377)|
| 3:43:01| and as well as Commissioner Baylor was talking, is very important at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13381)|
| 3:43:06| So thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13386)|
| 3:43:08| Before I call on Commissioner Daley and Commissioner Schoonmaker again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13388)|
| 3:43:14| I'm going to take a bit of privilege as the seat 10 commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13394)|
| 3:43:20| and offer a substitute motion to just move this forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13400)|
| 3:43:25| I think there is a tremendous amount of discussion still to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| I think there's some question about whether this is legal according to TCA rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13408)|
| 3:43:32| I think there's other opportunities to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| Do we want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13414)|
| 3:43:35| Do we want something separate or amended in a way that might help us tie this to a legislative body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13415)|
| 3:43:41| There are more questions than there are answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13421)|
| 3:43:43| and I think giving it a week of time does not hurt the validity of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13423)|
| 3:43:51| but it gives us time to make sure we get it right because the current motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13431)|
| 3:43:57| So I'm making a substitute motion to just move forward without recommendation to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13437)|
| 3:44:03| and I'll entertain a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13445)|
| 3:44:06| Second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13446)|
| 3:44:08| Is there discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13448)|
| 3:44:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker or Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13452)|
| 3:44:14| I just have one question on our other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| You can still ask that question if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13458)|
| 3:44:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker or Commissioner Daley, which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13460)|
| 3:44:23| I just have a question, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13465)|
| 3:44:26| I've heard three substitute motions, but none of them were seconded except for yours, correct, Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13466)|
| 3:44:33| I'm sorry, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| You talked about a substitute motion, but you never made it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13475)|
| 3:44:41| My thought was to bring that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13485)|
| 3:44:46| So we're good on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13486)|
| 3:44:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13487)|
| 3:44:48| The only substitute motion is to move forward without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13488)|
| 3:44:50| and then if there are other substitute motions, they may be made next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| This just moves it ahead one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13497)|
| 3:44:59| Since we've been talking about the liability question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13499)|
| 3:45:02| I just want to make sure that if our colleagues in the city of Knoxville do something to take enforcement action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13502)|
| 3:45:12| against their businesses, they would be sued and not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13512)|
| 3:45:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| We would be held harmless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| That's the way I feel about it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| We should be harmless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13523)|
| 3:45:24| If they want to do something, arrest a little old lady not wearing a mask, that's up to them, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13524)|
| 3:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13532)|
| 3:45:33| Seeing no other lights, there is a proper substitute motion on the floor with a second to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13533)|
| 3:45:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13542)|
| 3:45:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13543)|
| 3:45:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13545)|
| 3:45:46| This moves forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| I think there is lots of work that may be done, and we will revisit that in a substantive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13548)|
| 3:45:53| Before we move on to our ordinances, yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13553)|
| 3:45:57| I just want to say that I understand what I'm trying to listen to the mayor and Commissioner Ward and Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13557)|
| 3:46:09| and then like so many other things, trying to meld it into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13569)|
| 3:46:12| I don't quite get everything that either of them want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13572)|
| 3:46:17| It was my best effort to try to meld all those into one resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13577)|
| 3:46:21| You did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| Before we move forward, we're at our second two-hour mark, and we have substantive business to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13583)|
| 3:46:29| I'm going to put us into recess until 9.05, 10-minute break for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13589)|
| 3:46:34| We will return at 9.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13594)|
| 3:46:39| I'm going to call this meeting back into order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| A couple of quick housekeeping notes as you look at your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13601)|
| 3:46:45| The next item will be 57, but as we talk about 57, it will also tie to number 64, so we will take those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13605)|
| 3:46:55| Also, items number 69 and 70 have been moved to October at the request of Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13615)|
| 3:47:02| With Commissioner Ward's approval, I believe we had had substantive discussion about what 71 was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13622)|
| 3:47:09| Unless you have additional discussion, I think that we have had our fill for the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13629)|
| 3:47:13| I think I'm good, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13633)|
| 3:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13634)|
| 3:47:15| Okay, so we will not address number 71's discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13635)|
| 3:47:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13639)|
| 3:47:20| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13640)|
| 3:47:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13641)|
| 3:47:22| I just want to ask your and Commissioner Ward's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13642)|
| 3:47:27| I would like to move discussion item to next week since we're getting kind of in the later hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13647)|
| 3:47:32| I spoke with Jim Snowden, and he's okay with that as well, if you're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13652)|
| 3:47:36| Which item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13656)|
| 3:47:37| The discussion item, number 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| 68?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13659)|
| 3:47:40| The discussion item regarding the amendments to the Knox County zoning orders to allow planned development within the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13660)|
| 3:47:47| You want to move that one item to next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| Yes, it could go a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13669)|
| 3:47:52| I've handed out the pamphlets for all the other commissioners to take a look at over this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13672)|
| 3:48:02| I handed out the timeline earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13682)|
| 3:48:04| Do I have a copy of what you're showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13684)|
| 3:48:06| Yes, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13686)|
| 3:48:07| I set it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13687)|
| 3:48:08| Here, I'll come show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13688)|
| 3:48:09| Oh, I got it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13689)|
| 3:48:10| I got it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13690)|
| 3:48:21| I'm okay moving that at your request with the exception that we do have members of the public that are here to talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13701)|
| 3:48:27| and I pushed them out of public forum to stick around Mr. Murphy especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13707)|
| 3:48:34| I'm okay with moving it to next forward, but I want to give him an opportunity to speak before we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13714)|
| 3:48:43| I believe they're going to go find him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13723)|
| 3:48:45| Hey, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13725)|
| 3:48:48| Yes, let us move that item, number 68, to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13728)|
| 3:48:52| Now, I know it's late, and I know we have a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13732)|
| 3:48:55| Please don't start this as a precedent that we are going to move every other discussion item to next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13735)|
| 3:49:00| we are not going to jam like this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13740)|
| 3:49:02| So I'm going to make one exception and one exception only, and that's for 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13742)|
| 3:49:07| But I am going to let Mr. Murphy go ahead and address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| I imagine Mr. Murphy will be back with us next week as he is a diligent discussioner of such things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13750)|
| 3:49:16| So we're moving to discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13756)|
| 3:49:18| We're going to move discussion to next week on number 68,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13758)|
| 3:49:20| but we're going to allow Mr. Murphy to speak this week as well because he is here, and I did give him that courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13760)|
| 3:49:26| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13766)|
| 3:49:27| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| I don't know what Commissioner Biggs has in mind, so I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13770)|
| 3:49:34| Kevin, you might be able to read his mind, so you can go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13774)|
| 3:49:38| You may be speaking something totally that Mr. Snowden and Mr. Biggs and whoever has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13778)|
| 3:49:44| so I kind of like to hear myself what the purpose is behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13784)|
| 3:49:50| I agree, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13790)|
| 3:49:54| I could speak, and I've got about two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13794)|
| 3:49:57| It's a general introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13797)|
| 3:49:58| Go ahead, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13798)|
| 3:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13799)|
| 3:50:00| So Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13800)|
| 3:50:03| I'm here representing the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13803)|
| 3:50:06| We're a coalition of citizens and community groups that advocate for effective planning for the future of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13806)|
| 3:50:12| We support thoughtful planning processes that are easy to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13812)|
| 3:50:17| processes that take into account the concerns of all stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13817)|
| 3:50:20| and that understand the cumulative impacts of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| Plan development, the ordinance that's being discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13825)|
| 3:50:28| it's an optional process to encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13828)|
| 3:50:34| than what's possible under district zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13834)|
| 3:50:37| and it should also provide compensating amenities to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13837)|
| 3:50:42| It was originally introduced in the city of Knoxville during the RECO discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13842)|
| 3:50:47| and it was added with some changes to the Knox County zoning ordinance in January of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13847)|
| 3:50:53| During the drafting process, there was some discussion about where plan development should be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13853)|
| 3:50:58| Should it be only in the planned growth area, or should it also be allowed in the rural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13858)|
| 3:51:03| KCPA's position was and still is that we believe it would be best to test this in the planned growth area first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13863)|
| 3:51:09| work out the kinks, and then the ordinance can later be amended to add to the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13869)|
| 3:51:15| County Commission agreed with us when it adopted this in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13875)|
| 3:51:20| Since the adoption of this ordinance, there haven't been any planned development proposals submitted in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13880)|
| 3:51:26| and it doesn't seem like this optional process is what's being sought by the Development Committee for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13886)|
| 3:51:31| If it was, we'd see some proposals that have come in, but we haven't seen any yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13891)|
| 3:51:39| We're very cautious about more intense development in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13899)|
| 3:51:44| It's usually more expensive to Knox County, a lot more expensive to extend roads, sidewalks, utilities, emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13904)|
| 3:51:51| possibly parks and schools out to the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13911)|
| 3:51:54| So that's why we'd really like to keep this in the planned growth area until we've taken it for a few test drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13914)|
| 3:52:00| So a few suggestions for this discussion are what will happen if we introduce planned development process in the rural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13920)|
| 3:52:07| Ask those questions. What's the impact of the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13927)|
| 3:52:10| Then use that information to ask, does this proposal address issues or problems with planning, zoning and growth in the rural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13930)|
| 3:52:18| In the rural area, we know there are significant issues with sprawl infrastructure and the cost of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13938)|
| 3:52:24| Is planned development in the rural area an answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| I'm here to answer any questions, and if you'd like more to talk about this more, myself, Kim Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13948)|
| 3:52:33| we're happy to meet with you individually and talk about planned development and growth challenges in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13953)|
| 3:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13959)|
| 3:52:40| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13960)|
| 3:52:41| As just previously mentioned, you have been provided a document by Commissioner Biggs called Planning, Growth Policy and Planned Development Zone Timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13961)|
| 3:52:52| As everyone who's been with us for some time knows that planning and development and the planning of the growth for Knox County is a bit like a starfish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13972)|
| 3:53:02| It goes a little bit in every direction, and nobody quite knows what it is until you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13982)|
| 3:53:07| So I encourage everyone between now and next week when we will hold this discussion item to dig in, ask questions, talk to your planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13987)|
| 3:53:18| I know Ms. Amy is in the back there and can help us in any way, shape and form, and we will have a subsidence discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=13998)|
| 3:53:29| Moving on, Madam Clerk, if you would read the next item before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14009)|
| 3:53:36| Item number 57 is in Ordinance 0-20-7-102, submitting Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 2, Section 42-58, entitled Competitive Tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14016)|
| 3:53:51| List of Eligibles, and Section 42-59, entitled Filling the Vacancies to Establish Timeframes for Administering Employment Candidate Examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14031)|
| 3:54:01| This amends Ordinance 0-90-9-111, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14041)|
| 3:54:06| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| And also, item number 64 is a discussion item to create a special committee to study and evaluate the composition and structure of the Knox County Sheriff's Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14048)|
| 3:54:21| I'm going to open this by making a motion to defer item number 57 to January with the ability to read the statement as to why and the steps forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14061)|
| 3:54:31| But I'd like to have a motion before I read it so there's discussion available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14071)|
| 3:54:36| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14076)|
| 3:54:43| Is there a second for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14083)|
| 3:54:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| Second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14085)|
| 3:54:48| If you would allow me, I'm combining the discussion item 64 to this item because I think it's directly related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14088)|
| 3:54:55| Over the past few months, we've had some interesting conversations around the Merit Council that I believe has warranted some additional attention and work as a governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14095)|
| 3:55:04| After this summer's discussion, our new law director confirmed our governing role and responsibilities in a memo dated August 18, where he confirmed the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14104)|
| 3:55:14| Point one, the Sheriff's Merit Council was created by private act in 1970 under Chapter 326.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14114)|
| 3:55:21| It remained in effect until September 1990, at which time County Commission, by ordinance, passed the same private act as Ordinance O-90-9-111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14121)|
| 3:55:33| That ordinance, as amended from time to time by Commission, is the Merit System Ordinance in effect today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14133)|
| 3:55:39| He continues, to that end, the County and its Commission are not constrained by the Sheriff's Civil Service Law of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14139)|
| 3:55:47| The County Commission can alter or amend the present Merit System Ordinance as it deems fit and proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14147)|
| 3:55:53| And finally, he writes, County Commission can appoint a committee, if it deems beneficial, to meet with the Sheriff and Merit System in order to evaluate and make decisions regarding the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14153)|
| 3:56:05| While Item 57 in our agenda is one process change to consider, it has led to a much larger discussion about how the working relationship between the Merit Council and the Sheriff's Office Administration can be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14165)|
| 3:56:17| and how the functional operations of this system that represents the employees can be enhanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14177)|
| 3:56:22| As such, as part of this, separate from the resolution and the motion before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14182)|
| 3:56:27| I am forming, as the Chair, I'm forming a special committee that I will chair with the express purpose of putting all parties together over the next three months in a series of collaborative meetings where we can find working solutions that all parties can agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14187)|
| 3:56:40| I will then gather results of those meetings together into a comprehensive set of suggestions and potential reforms and bring those back to you in a consolidated resolution that can be debated and voted on in a new resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14200)|
| 3:56:53| This item may be part of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14213)|
| 3:56:56| I hope to meet at least a couple times per month over the next three months and bring the results and a resolution to you in January for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14216)|
| 3:57:04| This week, I will be inviting people to join the special committee and providing them the relevant information to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14224)|
| 3:57:10| Committee membership will include two members representing the Sheriff's Office Administration, two members representing the Merit Council, two officers from the rank and file, one independent citizen representative, and two members of the County Commission in addition to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14230)|
| 3:57:27| I would like to ask Commissioners Durrett and Ward if they would be willing to serve on such a special committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14247)|
| 3:57:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14253)|
| 3:57:35| Yes, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14255)|
| 3:57:37| I'll now entertain discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| The motion before you is to defer item number 57 to January in relation to forming the special committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14259)|
| 3:57:47| Ms. Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14267)|
| 3:57:48| Sir, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14268)|
| 3:57:50| What will the hiring practice be between now and January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14270)|
| 3:57:56| It would remain, without passing this ordinance, it would remain as it is now and as it has been for potentially the last decade or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14276)|
| 3:58:05| Operations would continue as they have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14285)|
| 3:58:08| It's my understanding that this ordinance is just putting that into paper, into record, that it's just reinstating the processes that they are following based on my meetings with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14288)|
| 3:58:22| My understanding was that this, and we have had a couple of different legal opinions back and forth, but this changes the, this ordinance, they wouldn't put an ordinance forward unless they were changing something that was currently not in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14302)|
| 3:58:36| So this changes the steps and processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14316)|
| 3:58:39| And I'm simply asking to wait until we really sit down and do it all at once instead of piecing one at a time or two at a time or three at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14319)|
| 3:58:47| I don't think I explained myself very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14327)|
| 3:58:49| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14329)|
| 3:58:50| What I was trying to say is that based on what I've been told that the process is and has been for however long, that this is just, that it was not necessarily specifically word for word everything that they do in the current ordinance that we follow or rules of the Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14330)|
| 3:59:11| and that this ordinance would then make those, make it exactly how it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14351)|
| 3:59:17| If I'm misunderstanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14357)|
| 3:59:19| Perhaps we could ask a member of the Merit Council or Sheriff's Department or both to further clarify, or the Law Department could opine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14359)|
| 3:59:30| If you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14370)|
| 3:59:34| Paula Taylor, Director of Merit Council, 912 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14374)|
| 3:59:37| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14377)|
| 3:59:38| So that is currently the way that we do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14378)|
| 3:59:41| And I was advised by the law director's office, Mr. Armstrong at the time, that the current language would be to just codify our current process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14381)|
| 3:59:55| Do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14395)|
| 3:59:57| If you would just state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14397)|
| 3:59:59| Gina Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14399)|
| 4:00:00| I'm a Merit Council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14400)|
| 4:00:06| We had actually discussed the ordinance request is to simply codify the language to the current practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14406)|
| 4:00:14| This will save Knox County over $90,000 each year in not having to complete these exams prior to the applicant being placed on the eligibility list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14414)|
| 4:00:23| The council would like to ask the commission not to defer, which you've done, this requested change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14423)|
| 4:00:29| Again, this is the fifth time this request has been before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14429)|
| 4:00:34| This is just personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| We've been up here five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14436)|
| 4:00:38| I'm on hour four and a half to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14438)|
| 4:00:43| This should have been taken care of five times ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14443)|
| 4:00:46| The main focus of the council is the men and women of the department, and we're wasting time and resources dealing with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14446)|
| 4:00:53| The council is concerned that if the rules change, they will not be there to protect the employees against the arbitrary sheriff or administration, and the employees will only be the ones to suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14453)|
| 4:01:04| The employees may still be able to come to the council to file grievance, but not for other issues that have concerns about salaries or rank issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14464)|
| 4:01:13| The Merit Council policies and procedures are in line with the ordinance, which were created for fair hiring, promotion, and discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14473)|
| 4:01:21| It seems that if the committee is created to change any of their policies to shift to the control of the sheriff's office, that the policies would then be in the best interest of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14481)|
| 4:01:32| We would like this taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14492)|
| 4:01:34| I understand that you want to put a committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14494)|
| 4:01:36| We have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14496)|
| 4:01:38| I've actually sent on the ethics committee with John Schoomaker, so I'm happy to have these two commissioners come on and explain it, but this is a huge waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14498)|
| 4:01:50| This should have been dealt with months ago, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14510)|
| 4:01:53| So, we would like you to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14513)|
| 4:01:56| I hope, also, I've asked Ms. Taylor at the commission's direction that we would like you all to have policies, procedures, and bylaws for the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14516)|
| 4:02:09| I'm pretty sure that not a lot of people know what we do over there, and this is for the men and women in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14529)|
| 4:02:17| This is to take care of them, protect them, watch out for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14537)|
| 4:02:22| That is the only reason that we sent on this volunteer committee, is for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14542)|
| 4:02:26| Thank you, Ms. Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14546)|
| 4:02:28| Mr. Buch, I'll turn to you, and then I'll ask if the administration from the sheriff's office would like to have any comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14548)|
| 4:02:35| I'm not going to get into policy issues, but the ordinance that's before you, there were some problems after the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14555)|
| 4:02:45| and they were brought up by Chief Rubel, and I agreed with them because what it was was it subjected the potentiality for an ADA lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14565)|
| 4:02:59| So, I drafted some very, just changed two lines in there, submitted that to the sheriff's office for them to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14579)|
| 4:03:06| Chief Rubel went over with his people and said that language is fine, and then I sent it on to the Merit Council for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14586)|
| 4:03:15| I thought that what this was was this one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14595)|
| 4:03:19| It's not the entire thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14599)|
| 4:03:22| It just has to do with what structure is being used so that the sheriff can go out and enlist people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14602)|
| 4:03:29| which he's having a hard time getting in these days and times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14609)|
| 4:03:33| It's for him to get people who want to come in and subject themselves to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14613)|
| 4:03:38| But evidently, I thought it was in agreement with the Merit Council and the sheriff, the one I prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14618)|
| 4:03:44| If that's the one that's before you and they're all in agreement, it could pass on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14624)|
| 4:03:49| But I'm not sure if that's what's before you because I haven't seen the exact thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14629)|
| 4:03:55| Is there anybody from the administration who would like to add any context to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14635)|
| 4:03:58| Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14638)|
| 4:04:02| Well, you're reaching the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14642)|
| 4:04:04| I'm hearing you that before there was an issue and it was not in, quote, legal form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14644)|
| 4:04:10| or the final legal language was not comfortable and now it is in legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14650)|
| 4:04:14| The legal language is everybody agrees is legal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14654)|
| 4:04:17| I thought everybody was in agreement on the slight changes that were made that would keep us out of getting into an ADA lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14657)|
| 4:04:24| Would you state your name for the record, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14664)|
| 4:04:26| Tom Spangler, 400 Main Avenue, Knox County Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14666)|
| 4:04:30| Let me start off by saying, let me repeat it again to make sure that I'm very clear when I say this to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14670)|
| 4:04:37| There is no way, no way in Hades that I want to do away with the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14677)|
| 4:04:43| I've heard that rumor and by God, I'm tired of hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14683)|
| 4:04:47| I'm an advocate of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14689)|
| 4:04:52| When it's said that I'm trying to be arbitrary against our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14692)|
| 4:04:57| why in the daylight would I stand up here and fight for those men and women every time I come to this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14697)|
| 4:05:07| I've been there. I've used the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| I know how important that Merit Council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14709)|
| 4:05:12| So don't try and throw that back at me that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14712)|
| 4:05:16| I'm not going to tolerate it. That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14716)|
| 4:05:20| And I don't mean to get upset about that, but I think, as Mr. Oster said, that we've been here for four and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14720)|
| 4:05:25| So I guess now it's time for me to stew a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14725)|
| 4:05:29| All I ask was that we change some of the administrative portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14729)|
| 4:05:34| Nothing to do, nothing to do with either the dealing with supervisor promotions, dealing with I'm so aggravated now, or any kind of discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14734)|
| 4:05:58| It's funny that I had a meeting with our former law director and was told, you know, the sheriff runs the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14758)|
| 4:06:05| It's funny that that is being that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14765)|
| 4:06:09| I'm not trying to run over anybody, run roughshod, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14769)|
| 4:06:14| I think everybody up here knows that I wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14774)|
| 4:06:17| And if I did, then you hold me to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14777)|
| 4:06:19| You hold my feet to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14779)|
| 4:06:23| But I'm not going to stand up here and let you, I'm sorry, let it be said by rumors and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14783)|
| 4:06:29| And I'm not saying that that's what was said here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14789)|
| 4:06:32| But I'm going to defend not only myself, but I'm going to defend that agency until the day that I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14792)|
| 4:06:39| And the men and women of that agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14799)|
| 4:06:41| They mean as much to me as anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14801)|
| 4:06:44| And I'm going to make sure I take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14804)|
| 4:06:46| And sometimes, just like with everybody else, we have children and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14806)|
| 4:06:51| We have to do take corrective action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| You know, it's not easy to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14813)|
| 4:06:57| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14817)|
| 4:06:58| I took that responsibility on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14818)|
| 4:07:00| And I told this community, that's what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14820)|
| 4:07:03| I'm going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14823)|
| 4:07:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14826)|
| 4:07:07| I didn't mean to get carried away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14827)|
| 4:07:08| It's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14828)|
| 4:07:09| Sheriff Spangler, regarding this particular ordinance that's before that, do you have an issue with it moving forward today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14829)|
| 4:07:16| I don't have an issue with that ordinance changed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14836)|
| 4:07:20| But I want that committee put together so that we can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14840)|
| 4:07:25| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| I'm going to amend my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14847)|
| 4:07:30| Mr. Daley, you have a discussion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14850)|
| 4:07:33| It sounds like you're headed in the same direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14855)|
| 4:07:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14858)|
| 4:07:39| Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| Paula, do you agree with the language that the law department has worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14861)|
| 4:07:47| As long as it's what was attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| I mean, it just is what we're currently doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14869)|
| 4:07:52| And we should pass this ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14872)|
| 4:07:54| Well, same with no recommendation and do it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14874)|
| 4:07:58| But we'd probably be smart to go ahead and approve it tonight so we don't have to discuss it next Saturday or next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14878)|
| 4:08:04| But then set up a committee, as the chairman says, to discuss other aspects of the merit council, set up policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14884)|
| 4:08:14| I'll let you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14894)|
| 4:08:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14898)|
| 4:08:20| I would amend my motion to move forward with no recommendation the next week at the legislative session where we would vote on it in its final form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14900)|
| 4:08:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| He was the original second, so if I'm adjusting, I need to stick with that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14911)|
| 4:08:37| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14917)|
| 4:08:40| So the motion before you is to move forward to next week without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14920)|
| 4:08:43| That would put it to a vote next week in its final form and its second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14923)|
| 4:08:47| And that would, if approved at that point, it would be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14927)|
| 4:08:51| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14931)|

| 4:08:57| We will vote on it next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=14937)|

| 4:11:36| And I will ask Drew Silla to please make sure everyone gets an invitation directly and a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15096)|
| 4:11:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15103)|
| 4:11:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15104)|
| 4:11:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15105)|
| 4:11:46| Also, did we actually hand out those resolutions to them last time or did we still have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15106)|
| 4:11:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15110)|
| 4:11:51| We kept them for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15111)|
| 4:11:52| We did that on Monday because we were on virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15112)|
| 4:11:55| Remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15115)|
| 4:11:56| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15116)|
| 4:11:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15118)|
| 4:11:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15121)|
| 4:12:02| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15122)|
| 4:12:05| We've discussed item 64, so we're on 65, discussion item to create a special committee to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15125)|
| 4:12:11| and evaluate the composition structure in terms of members of all Knox County boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15131)|
| 4:12:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15137)|
| 4:12:18| For several years now, we have often discussed what committees this commission has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15138)|
| 4:12:22| if they are functional or necessary at all, if they are structured correctly, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15142)|
| 4:12:27| and whether we can more effectively structure our local government to better serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15147)|
| 4:12:31| I believe the time to conduct a systematic review is long overdue, and as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15151)|
| 4:12:35| I'm forming a special committee to study and evaluate the composition and structure of our committees as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15155)|
| 4:12:42| To get a fresh set of eyes on our committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15162)|
| 4:12:44| I would like to ask all of our new commissioners, Lundy, Durrett, Ward, and Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15164)|
| 4:12:49| if they would be willing to serve on this special committee alongside Commissioner Smith and Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15169)|
| 4:12:53| who will help provide valuable guidance and commission experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15173)|
| 4:12:57| Are you all willing to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15177)|
| 4:12:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15179)|
| 4:13:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15181)|
| 4:13:02| I'll leave the details of who will chair this committee and when you'll meet to the six of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15182)|
| 4:13:06| I would also like this special committee to complete the scope of work by the end of the calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15186)|
| 4:13:11| and bring recommendations to the Rules Committee in January so changes and improvements can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15191)|
| 4:13:17| To our Rules Committee Chair, Mr. Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15197)|
| 4:13:19| I would like to recommend you schedule something in January so that we can keep on that timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15199)|
| 4:13:25| and then discuss it thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| I'll now entertain additional discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15207)|
| 4:13:32| Say yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15212)|
| 4:13:33| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15213)|
| 4:13:34| Mr. Chair, isn't this what we used to have years ago called committee on committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15214)|
| 4:13:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15219)|
| 4:13:40| We don't have that, so I'm able to form a special committee to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15220)|
| 4:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15224)|
| 4:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15226)|
| 4:13:47| Because I think when we form something, if it has a timeline, it expires and it doesn't exist anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15227)|
| 4:13:52| So at one time it may have existed and then went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15232)|
| 4:13:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| Please just keep in touch with myself and Drisilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| Also, Drisilla has already pulled all the information on all the fact sheets and all the things about all the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15239)|
| 4:14:05| has a giant binder and two little Rolodex boxes of amazing amounts of information that may or may not be relevant to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15245)|
| 4:14:15| and I recommend that you use her as an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| Chair, Chairman, would it be appropriate to ask Drisilla to perhaps communicate with all on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15259)|
| 4:14:28| and throw out some suggested dates so that we'll have a center and that being Drisilla to make this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15268)|
| 4:14:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15278)|
| 4:14:39| I see her nodding, and she will make it so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15279)|
| 4:14:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15282)|
| 4:14:43| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| Item 66 is a discussion item regarding the Knox County Commission Planning and Priorities Retreat for 2020-2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15285)|
| 4:14:55| We are on the homestretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| Stick with us, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15297)|
| 4:14:58| We're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15298)|
| 4:15:00| A little over a year ago we held the first ever planning retreat for the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15300)|
| 4:15:04| This two-day session was held at Johnson University and was facilitated by Dr. Jerry Askew and the team at the Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15304)|
| 4:15:11| The overall purpose of the retreat was to come together as a legislative body to identify key priorities for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15311)|
| 4:15:18| and find areas of consensus to work together on and then convey those to work together on with the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15318)|
| 4:15:25| Attached to the online agenda is a summary document that outlines the work we completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15325)|
| 4:15:30| and the five key priorities we agreed upon for the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15330)|
| 4:15:33| However, we barely got into some of the action items when COVID changed everyone's schedule and priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15333)|
| 4:15:38| and we have not revisited it since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15338)|
| 4:15:40| I brought this up tonight to open the topic to all of you and discuss whether this body wants to hold another retreat at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15340)|
| 4:15:46| make a retreat an annual event, change the format or purpose, or take the entire retreat idea in a completely different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15346)|
| 4:15:53| I personally believe that strategic planning is an important tool for every organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15353)|
| 4:15:57| As our former planning director reminded us, if you don't know where you're going, any road will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15357)|
| 4:16:03| I found our first retreat engaging and helpful, and I believe we should continue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15363)|
| 4:16:07| But what say you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15367)|
| 4:16:08| I'll now entertain discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15368)|
| 4:16:10| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15370)|
| 4:16:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15372)|
| 4:16:13| I'll tell you, in the 20 months I've been on commission, I think the highlight was that retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15373)|
| 4:16:17| I thought it was tremendously productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15377)|
| 4:16:19| If nothing else, I think it was productive in helping us get to know one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15379)|
| 4:16:23| and I would be excited for the four new members of the commission to be able to participate in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15383)|
| 4:16:30| I would hope the chair might offer some suggestions as to the format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15390)|
| 4:16:33| I'm in the office as well as members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15393)|
| 4:16:35| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15395)|
| 4:16:36| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15396)|
| 4:16:37| I just want to say thank you very much for the retreat as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15397)|
| 4:16:40| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15400)|
| 4:16:41| Watch your button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15403)|
| 4:16:44| Very much for the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15404)|
| 4:16:45| I think it would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15405)|
| 4:16:46| I've heard great things about the ones in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15406)|
| 4:16:49| Even expanding it further would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15409)|
| 4:16:51| I just want to make sure that we're fiscally mindful this year of all the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15411)|
| 4:16:55| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| Additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15419)|
| 4:17:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15421)|
| 4:17:02| I sat in on the school part of that retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15422)|
| 4:17:06| and agree that it was productive in the things that I observed that you were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15426)|
| 4:17:13| I would like to agree with what you said about strategic planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15433)|
| 4:17:20| and I think that we have been remiss in not having something more concrete and a timeline for some specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15440)|
| 4:17:33| I think that was the attempt last year, and then, as you said, COVID got everything messed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15453)|
| 4:17:40| So I would love to have that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15460)|
| 4:17:43| and look toward the goal of having something on paper that we can present to our constituents about this is what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15463)|
| 4:17:52| this is where we're going, this is some planning that's where we want to be in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15472)|
| 4:17:58| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15478)|
| 4:17:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15481)|
| 4:18:02| The only comment I would like to have is that possibly we would consider picking a location centrally located for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15482)|
| 4:18:13| and maybe the Knoxville Chamber or something like that that still has media-type equipment to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15493)|
| 4:18:20| Hold your thoughts, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15500)|
| 4:18:24| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15504)|
| 4:18:26| By seeing a majority of the body thinking that this is a good thing, I would like to ask Commissioner Hill if you would spearhead it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15506)|
| 4:18:35| That would be deciding when it would be sometime this winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15515)|
| 4:18:39| I believe we sort of left it saying that we should do it in the January-February range before we get into budget season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15519)|
| 4:18:45| because if we know our priorities, our mayor may adjust his priorities, and that ties to our budgeting priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15525)|
| 4:18:53| Ultimately, if you would find out who would facilitate it, what would the costs or what the structure would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15533)|
| 4:18:58| and basically be the chair of the retreat this year, would you be willing to serve in that capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15538)|
| 4:19:05| So you're asking me to plan this retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15545)|
| 4:19:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15547)|
| 4:19:09| You are so enthusiastic about it, and you have been through, and let me say this, you have been through many another retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15549)|
| 4:19:15| and I believe that experience to be valuable in driving our commission forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15555)|
| 4:19:21| Nonetheless, I have not asked you to serve in any other big capacity, and I think you're pretty welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15561)|
| 4:19:25| Hey, you just put me on the special committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| Yeah, but that's got like eight people on it, so that's small lifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15567)|
| 4:19:31| Additional conversation, Ms. Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15571)|
| 4:19:33| I have event planning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15573)|
| 4:19:36| Would you like to co-chair this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15576)|
| 4:19:38| I will be more than happy to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15578)|
| 4:19:40| Commissioner Hill, would you co-chair this with Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15580)|
| 4:19:43| I would be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15583)|
| 4:19:45| I would appreciate some specific guidance and input from the rest of the board on what you would like to see on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15585)|
| 4:19:54| so that when we do come together for this retreat that we are, in fact, doing things that you would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15594)|
| 4:20:01| So I'll maybe get with Driscilla and ask her to put something out to all of you so that I can gather some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15601)|
| 4:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15611)|
| 4:20:12| Thank you for stepping up and serving the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15612)|
| 4:20:15| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15615)|
| 4:20:16| We are literally on the homestretch, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15616)|
| 4:20:19| It's item number 67, discussion item regarding the Knox County Ethics Committee non-voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15619)|
| 4:20:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you asked for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15625)|
| 4:20:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15628)|
| 4:20:31| As most of you know, I was appointed to the Ethics Committee when I was elected to my first full-year term in August of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15631)|
| 4:20:43| At that point in time, I was told I was going to serve four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15643)|
| 4:20:48| According to the bylaws of the Ethics Committee, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15648)|
| 4:20:53| Members of the Ethics Committee shall serve staggered four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15653)|
| 4:20:57| Members shall be permitted to serve only one full four-year term, regardless of who appoints the member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15657)|
| 4:21:07| What has happened, apparently, is there's been an unofficial opinion from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15667)|
| 4:21:16| excuse me, the law director's office, that says that the appointee from county commission, the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15676)|
| 4:21:22| and the mayor's office are there for the occupancy of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15682)|
| 4:21:28| It doesn't say that anywhere is in the rules for the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15688)|
| 4:21:33| And so I contend that my term of service on the Ethics Committee expired on August 31st of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15693)|
| 4:21:43| and that this body needs to appoint a new four-year term person to serve on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15703)|
| 4:21:50| So I think that needs to be an added item to the agenda for next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15710)|
| 4:21:56| so that that person has the opportunity to be prepared prior to the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15716)|
| 4:22:02| The Ethics Committee meets just four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15722)|
| 4:22:06| And that would have to be a specific resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15726)|
| 4:22:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15730)|
| 4:22:11| So we would need to add a resolution next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15731)|
| 4:22:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15733)|
| 4:22:15| Is there any discussion about this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15735)|
| 4:22:18| So you, just to be clear, you would submit a letter of resignation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15738)|
| 4:22:22| I wouldn't have to because based on this, it expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15742)|
| 4:22:26| And we just didn't add it in on the September 1st because they were thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15746)|
| 4:22:32| they made up a definition, I guess you could say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15752)|
| 4:22:37| So if you would work with the law department to prepare a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15757)|
| 4:22:39| we would be able to add that next week with a two-thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15759)|
| 4:22:42| and then we could appoint the person and they would be the new appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15762)|
| 4:22:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15766)|
| 4:22:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15767)|
| 4:22:49| Madam Clerk, are there any more items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200921?start=15769)|
