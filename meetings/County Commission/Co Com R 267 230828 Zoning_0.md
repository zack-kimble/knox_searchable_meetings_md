| 0:11:21| I'll make it brief as I can. Basically, this is modeled after a concept in North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=681.96)|
| 0:11:28| called Red Bridges Barbecue. And clearly, I don't miss many meals, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=688.52)|
| 0:11:31| So what we're doing is taking a property that's an old house, and it's three acres. It's sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=691.96)|
| 0:11:37| of sandwiched between the industrial park, the creek, and Hardin Valley Animal Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=697.1600000000001)|
| 0:11:42| And we're making this an old-fashioned smokeyard. So what that means, it's a place you go as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=702.6)|
| 0:11:46| family, and you can have a meal that we want, if the parking works out, to have additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=706.44)|
| 0:11:52| food truck parking in the front. I operate a food truck hub in West Knoxville called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=712.2)|
| 0:11:55| the Chef's Workshop. So we're familiar with the food truck world, and we operate in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=715.72)|
| 0:12:00| world already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=720.2)|
| 0:12:01| But the idea is it's something, it's a venue you go to. We're also working with various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=721.72)|
| 0:12:07| aspects with Cardinal Health. And we're on the creek. We've got a little over 1,000 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=727.24)|
| 0:12:11| of frontage on the creek. And we're trying to, with this Knox Waterways Trail, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=731.1600000000001)|
| 0:12:15| on that trail. And so we're trying to figure out how to configure a kayak launch, landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=735.4)|
| 0:12:19| those kind of things. But we're way preliminary at this point to see if that's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=739.72)|
| 0:12:23| But it'd be an added addition if we can get that to work as well. So you could come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=743.4)|
| 0:12:27| us, park your car, get a ride upstream, get dropped off, and float back to us, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=747.24)|
| 0:12:32| you've got dinner, you've got a place to do something with your family. That's the summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=752.28)|
| 0:12:36| of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=756.1999999999999)|

| 0:18:31| and we have just submitted a concept plan that will be heard before Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1111.8000000000002)|

| 0:18:54| So it's primarily trying to provide some housing that is cost-accessible housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1134.8400000000001)|
| 0:19:03| by way of doing townhomes, by doing as much density as we can achieve within the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1143.3200000000002)|

| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1156.28)|

| 0:20:52| So PR-6 will grant us up to nine units, which would be three triplexes or nine townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1252.2800000000002)|
| 0:21:01| which is our intent for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1261.24)|
| 0:21:03| And I respectfully ask approval per Planning Commission's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1263.88)|
| 0:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1267.48)|
| 0:21:08| Commissioners, Commissioner Frazier, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1268.38)|

| 0:21:11| Question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1271.82)|
| 0:21:13| Staff recommended up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1273.1)|
| 0:21:16| Can you just give us some information on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1276.38)|
| 0:21:19| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1279.5)|
| 0:21:22| I think when staff was doing their analysis and the recommendation for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1282.94)|
| 0:21:27| I'm just going to turn on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1287.82)|
| 0:21:33| They were looking at the surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1293.82)|
| 0:21:36| They were looking at the surrounding, the densities of the developments in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1296.14)|
| 0:21:44| And the recommendation was primarily based off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1304.14)|
| 0:21:47| So you'll see a lot of one to four dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1307.42)|
| 0:21:51| Mr. Rackley, have you all reached out to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1311.26)|
| 0:21:53| There were 10 public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1313.8200000000002)|
| 0:21:57| Have you made any attempt to reach out to them, talk about your project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1317.1000000000001)|
| 0:22:00| hopefully just have a good intentional conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1320.5400000000002)|
| 0:22:03| We have had conversations with the adjoining property owners on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1323.5800000000002)|
| 0:22:08| Obviously, until zoning is finalized, we don't have detailed plans or a project to even do yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1328.78)|
| 0:22:15| even though we've already purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1335.8200000000002)|
| 0:22:18| I think at Planning Commission, I made the argument that the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1338.22)|
| 0:22:21| staff recommendations and our request was three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1341.5)|
| 0:22:24| So it's six townhomes at their recommendation or nine townhomes at our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1344.78)|
| 0:22:29| And I think that they agreed that being such a small parcel, it wasn't that big of a leap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1349.98)|
| 0:22:35| Obviously, if this were 20 acres or 30 acres or 40 acres, PR4 to PR6 would be a giant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1355.9)|
| 0:22:43| But we're just trying, again, to find opportunities in the desirable zip codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1363.1)|
| 0:22:51| the area that my clients normally build in, to try to optimize and provide the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1371.42)|
| 0:22:59| and provide the housing at a more accessible price point for that zip code to try to fit the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1379.26)|
| 0:23:06| As you move forward with your project and you learn more about the way that you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1386.54)|
| 0:23:10| develop it, I ask you to please stay in communication with the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1390.86)|
| 0:23:15| and the adjacent property owners and just keep them up to date and answer any questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1395.98)|
| 0:23:21| they might have along the way. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1401.26)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you. Absolutely, we will. And you know I generally do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1403.5)|
| 0:23:27| So once we have a concept plan, which I've not even began yet, but once we submit something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1407.58)|
| 0:23:32| we will absolutely be reaching out with the surrounding communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1412.3799999999999)|
| 0:23:35| property owners to let them know what's coming. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1415.82)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1422.22)|
| 0:23:45| in the documents that you provided to us for tonight's meeting, you have a notation in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1425.26)|
| 0:23:51| that in May of 2019 they tried to rezone this property at six dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1431.5)|
| 0:24:01| and then the application was withdrawn. Is this the same applicant that in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1441.02)|
| 0:24:07| wanted to have the six dwelling units per acre? I'd have to double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1447.9)|
| 0:24:14| I can answer that and tell you no. We're not the same applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1454.38)|
| 0:24:18| Okay. We purchased the property in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1458.78)|
| 0:24:23| Okay. So, and we don't know that why it was withdrawn. Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1463.98)|
| 0:24:31| No, sir, I do not know. Because of the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1471.6599999999999)|
| 0:24:34| I do not know. I can take a look here and see if there's any history specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1474.3799999999999)|
| 0:24:41| on that case that I can find on KJS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1481.58)|
| 0:24:48| Is that going to take a while or is it pretty quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1488.7)|
| 0:24:54| Yes, it'll take a couple minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1494.7)|
| 0:24:56| Okay. I'll see if there's any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1496.7)|
| 0:25:06| Are there any other questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1506.1399999999999)|

| 0:25:28| If I may, I can give you what bit of insight or hearsay I have of the prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1528.54)|

| 0:25:40| couldn't get the funding to buy the property and so that's why they withdrew the application. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1540.1399999999999)|
| 0:25:44| that's, again, what we were told when the property came back available and we got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1544.7)|
| 0:25:50| under contract and subsequently purchased it. Yes, it looks like that the applicant requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1550.94)|
| 0:25:57| a withdrawal on April 22, 2019, which would have been in advance of the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1557.3400000000001)|

| 0:26:27| up the street, there's five. So, I don't have a problem with the density either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1587.74)|
| 0:26:31| considering this is such a small property. So, I'll make a motion to approve PR at six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230828-zoning?start=1591.34)|
