| 0:20:44| his military career. But Ben joined the army when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| he was 16 years old. He was 17 in the invasion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1248)|

| 0:21:03| that stayed with the 1st Infantry Division as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| career and became a command sergeant major. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| just got back from Normandy where the French| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| honored him. He's won the cross to gear but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| French aren't honored him with the French Legion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Honor the highest award that the French bestow on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| military or civilian. And I was there at Lausanne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Belize with with Ben when he got it. And then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| went to the cemetery at Coalville Sommaire where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Ben met with President Obama President Sarkozy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| Prime Minister Gordon Brown Prime Minister Stephen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Harper and Prince Charles. And it's been been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| good southerner told the prince a pretty good story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| where in during the war the some of the army guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| learned that the future queen of England had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| already volunteered to fight in the war and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| were pretty impressed with that. So he told Prince| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Charles that story. And Prince Charles says I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| don't believe my mother's ever heard that. So he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| took it back. He said he was going to tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| queen that he'd met this American soldier who told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| the story. So in my estimation Ben is not only a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| great hero he's a true hero and he's also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| national treasure for the United States and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1347)|

| 0:22:40| has there been another. I hadn't been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| really nail that down but I know that there's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| other but he's not from Knoxville. OK. Or East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| Tennessee. But I think we can say he's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| very few if not the only one. But I haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| able just to prove that beyond a doubt. But that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| puts him in pretty good company. I think we've all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| read that Omaha Beach was the bloodiest of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| battles and to know that your landing ship was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| blown up and you could have. I'm not sure. I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| I would have had the courage to keep swimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| toward the beach instead of away from it. But all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| of us are grateful. We're proud that you're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Knoxvillian and East Tennessean. And we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1398)|

| 0:25:16| to a little bit more mundane than storming the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| beaches of Normandy. But important that we'll let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1518)|

| 0:26:49| can't spend the whole day down here. Farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1609)|

| 0:26:53| Wednesdays and Saturdays. One last thing he's I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| don't think he's here but I do want to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| that because so many of us have worked with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| over time at TDOT that Fred Corum is retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| effective today as the region one director. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| began his career 53 years ago plotting out the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| interstate system and wondering why in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| anybody would need an inner an intersection at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Cedar Bluff Road because it was so far out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| country. But he became region director back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| 1984 and he's been great for us to work with. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| we will miss Fred and just want to publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| recognize him as well now. So that is it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Mayor's report. Any council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Councilman Booker. Mr. Mayor since you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| the activities on the World's Fair site and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| would be free parking and all the good stuff. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| just like to mention that the Austin High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Alumni Association is celebrating the hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| thirtieth anniversary of Austin High School that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| evening at the convention center. And since all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| the parking spaces will be gone by the time we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| there we've rented a garage at the Civic Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| and we will have a fleet of buses taking people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| from there to the convention center from five to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| seven o'clock. And those buses will bring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| back from 10 until midnight. So we need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| that out there too. Thank you. Perfect. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| 130th anniversary of the inauguration of Austin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| High School. That's correct. That's great. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| you. And thanks for your role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Councilman Pelo. Yes I'd like to mention a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| of things. You know Mr. Quorum has meant so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| to so many of us who've had to work through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| construction. So we have many of us have thanked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| him in our own personal ways. But I just thought I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| would mention that Mr. King informed me today. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| believe he went out to the celebration and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| the building there the T-DOT building has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| named for Mr. Quorum which is very exciting. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| then I'd just like to mention Glenn Malone. Glenn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| has been our smart fix guy who has been emailing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| us on all of the updates. And Glenn was in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| of the paper mill construction project. And I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| to know him very well when he was when I first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| went on council. And Glenn this was Glenn's last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| day. So truly there's going to be some turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| at T-DOT and we'll miss those folks that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| so great to work with. Just wanted to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| that. And then I want to invite you Mayor Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and everyone else to the band concert at West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| Hills Park. This has gotten to be a tradition. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| on Sunday July the 12th the the Knoxville what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| it? Community band will be performing for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| us. So bring your blanket bring your chair bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| whatever you want to bring in all your friends and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| come out to West Hills Park and enjoy that band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| concert. It's wonderful in an open atmosphere like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| that. And so we would welcome you there. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| you. Vice Mayor Becker. Thank you Mr. Mayor. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| quick. I guess this is an announcement slash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| question from my fellow council members. At the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| last council meeting we talked. I mentioned I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| not be at the next council meeting. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Flemington school issue is coming up. And I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| to actually request I know we cannot postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| until next Tuesday. But I wanted to check. We can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| postpone it until Tuesday the I guess that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| 14th. But I wanted to ask with four folks both for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| myself and for those folks who would have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| on both sides that issue whether we can get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| agreement now that we are going to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| because it would feel worthwhile on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| controversial issue like this to tell folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| beforehand that we're postponing. I will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| there to vote. So I really have no say. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| would like to ask council's agreement. And let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| me preface that I think from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| standpoint that's fine. So I'll preface a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| conversation that must be. Well I'll just comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| on that because I've been a little concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| how that was going to work out. And I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| I think an agreement that we will not hear it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| that evening would be helpful to everyone. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| would certainly support that when the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| comes to vote on that. Councilman Hall. When are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| you proposing postponing it to. Just till the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| meeting after that. OK. I will not be here at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| next meeting. Oh in the 28th. And I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| be here when that's heard if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| That does go because I don't know. I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| think. I don't I don't think anybody with a 10 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| plan office is here. Actually they are just just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| putting it off an additional two. David or John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| does. I'm not here that July 11th meeting or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| August 11th. What about the second meeting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| John. What about. August 25th. That's the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| That's is that putting you all in. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| might. John David one of y'all could come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| podium to speak. I think Councilman Becker's trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| to see if we can get to a good time when folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| What's your drop dead date for council decide. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| guess that's the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I'm not sure I have one mayor. Our interest would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| be to have it heard as soon as possible. As we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| mentioned before we've got some commitments to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| that the zoning's in place in order to satisfy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| grant awards that we're talking about. One of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| awards the Federal Home Owned Bank. We have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| with them and I think we have some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| with them. Forgive me while I run through some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| dates here. I think our drop dead date would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| probably be sometime in August. We would need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| have it in place. OK. But certainly we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| prefer sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| I'm trying to figure out if there's a date between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| you think it's. August 25th is the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| that all nine of us can be at. And that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| challenge. My sense is if you need it sometime in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| August. That's getting late in August. Let me come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| back over here real quick. Councilman Frost. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| conferred with Mr. Swanson. It'll take two readings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| assuming it passes on the first time. It will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| to be a good point. I can't read until it's thrown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| into December. I mean September. Excuse me. No. Why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| would it. It's a it's a use on review. Is it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| use on review. I thought it was a change. Well if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| it is a use on review then maybe it'll just take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| one reading granting the use on review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| appeal any use on review. I was. It's an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| OK. Well there are a number of appeals that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| actually are on ordinances. But if this is on a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| on review it will only take the one reading. So one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| reading will accomplish what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Councilman Roddy. Perhaps it's worth considering a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| special meeting if there's adequate public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| that all the interested parties could could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| here. You know in the interest of addressing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| for everyone. Maybe we need to look at a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| call meeting. I would. I think we do. I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| is important enough. I know there's a enough views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| I think it is one of those ones that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| don't want to miss. So we'd be one. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Hawkins. Well it sounds like from their standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| they'd like to have it as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| obviously. But they said if we could do it what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| heard is if it could be done in August it'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| OK. So the August 25th meeting may not be too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| late. David you want to comment or. Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2079)|
| 0:34:49| I'm just not quite sure what to say. We'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| to work with the funders and see how. Could we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| maybe do this. We'll let the 10 year plan office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| and Southeast Housing see how far they can push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| this back. If they cannot make it to August 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| we'll make an effort to have a special called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| meeting. Is that. Sometime in August. Well we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| try. I think that the two of you sound like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| ones that have schedules where you're gone. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| try to work around. You could maybe before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| leave tonight leave us the dates when you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| gone and we could work around those. I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| gone for 17 till August the first of July 17th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| the first. OK. Well before you leave we'll try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| get those council record. We're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| this discussion now. Why don't we. I think Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| and I have arranged to be out of town at exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| opposite to make it complicated. OK. We'll do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| that. And then if we can wait till August 25th I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| think that's council's preference. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| I'm hearing. Right. Number one if we can and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| we can't then we'll have a special call. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| David. Mayor I just say and certainly we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| mean inconvenience council but our preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| would be if at all possible to have a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| meeting where all council members could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| present as soon as possible because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| beyond our deadline with the federal home loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| bank. And they've kind of given us some latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| there. But we've got a progress report coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| at the end of this month. So. OK. Well I'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| with Councilman Becker and Councilman Hall and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| to find if there's one day when everybody's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| to be here as soon as we can do that. And we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| give adequate notice to Miss Roddy's point. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| and I guess just a question of notice. And I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| to ask Mr. Holquist. Do you feel well connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| with the neighborhood folks to be able to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| some calls to make sure that they've heard it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| soon as the decision gets made. About when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| going to know if we have a special meeting. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| know as soon as a decision is made to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| that folks have heard that that date. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| good network. Yeah the word will get out. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| counting on you to activate the network I guess. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| don't think that's necessary but I will if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| necessary. OK. Thank you. Thank you. So we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| going to leave that with us trying to find a date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| when Councilman Becker and Councilman Hall are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| both here and then we will circulate that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| council for approval. And then we'll try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| that out to all interested parties. OK. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2227)|

| 0:41:23| in the convenient voting pilot project. I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| two folks signed up to speak and we can hear those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| if that's typically been OK. Charles Frazier first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| and Daniel Brown second. Charles if you give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2493)|

| 0:41:45| one. Indeed a pleasure to be here. Thank the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| for listening today. Convenience voting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| something that I've talked to people in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| about and I find that everybody's in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| because it gives people an opportunity of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| to vote at a time. Maybe it work when it's quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| a distance from where they live. So convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| voting is something I think is for the people. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| as you are sitting here as a governing body the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| most important issue that we all should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| when we're making choices and we do appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| legislature for this proposal. But one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| most important decisions that we should always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| make is for the people. So convenience voting gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| people an opportunity to vote at their convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| Thanks. And I hope you all in support. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| very much. Thank you. Daniel Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| Daniel Brown 23 18 Dillon Street. I'm here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| express my support for the convenience voting. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| think that it is something that could be tried. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| after a period of maybe three years if the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| says that it is not increasing voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| participation you can go back to what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| now. I've been an election worker for the past eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| years. So I have some experience in dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| that. But I think it's something that should at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| least be tried. And if it does not work after a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| certain reasonable period of time then I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| should go back to the present system. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| for listening. Thank you. OK. Comments from members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| of council. Right now there's no motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| floor. Just remind you Ms. Roddy. I'd like to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| up Mr. McKay for a question. And while he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| coming to the podium this is a discussion that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| and I have had previously. But I just like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| for him to confirm it for the other members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| council in talking to various constituents that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| have contacted me about this issue. As we heard the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| last time there is concern from folks about not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| having their neighborhood precincts to vote in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Election Day. And I called Mr. McKay and asked if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| it were possible to do a compromise hybrid type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| system where we would have convenience voting for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| period of days maybe 20 maybe fewer. Mr. McKay has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| gone on record as saying that he feels like 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| might even be too many. And roll into Election Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| where the convenience centers remained open but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| the precincts were also open on that day. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| would allow folks to vote both places and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| eliminate the confusion that we've heard so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| where folks show up at the in our present system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| they sometimes show up at the early voting sites on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Election Day and don't realize they're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| be at their precinct or vice versa or they show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| at the wrong precinct and they don't know where to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| vote in this compromise type system. They could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| to a convenience center if their address had changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| or whatever. And unfortunately it sounds like during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| the day because of the way the state enabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| legislation is written this is not possible. But I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| like Mr. McKay to comment on that. Yes we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| decide so we need your name address first. My name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| is Greg McKay. I live at 504 Bosworth Road and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| the administrator of elections. Still. You heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| something. We looked at the law and the law is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| specific about it. It says that if you're using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| voting centers during the election and the election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| day precincts will not be open. So while that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| be you know a pretty good compromise I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| just not possible. And I understand that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| compromise you know if it were available in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| future does not necessarily save us money because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| are still opening all of the precincts. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| we've also talked in this body that that when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| comes to voter participation that the number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| criterion shouldn't be saving money necessarily. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| should be opening up access to as many citizens as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| possible to participate and vote. So I do plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| support this ordinance or this resolution. I guess it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| is this evening despite the fact that that option is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| not available knowing that it is a pilot project. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| understanding Mr. McKay is that this would approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| only for this cycle of municipal elections in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| 2009. That is correct. And if it would indeed pass I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| would like to revisit it particularly if if we find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| afterward that there is a real void by not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| those precincts in the neighborhoods and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| revisit this and look at a hybrid. I know our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| current system has been called a hybrid system but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| perhaps look at a hybrid system of the nature that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| I've talked about this evening as maybe being a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| to open up voting precinct or election availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| to more citizens. So I do plan on supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| tonight. Thank you. Councilman Bailey. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| mayor. I'm glad we had the extra month to for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| get out among the voters and ask them their opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| and really it's where I left off a month ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| it's I could really flip a coin one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| I haven't heard from anybody who's against it. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| heard from a number of people that are for it. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| think though you know one of my concerns was is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| people that have been voting at the same location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| for 40 50 60 70 years and on election day they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| down to their school or church to vote and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| no place to vote. And so I think our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| is in the awareness making it you know voters aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| that that it's changed. And I know you indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| you were going to send out a mailer which cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| fifty thousand dollars or so. And I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| hear your thoughts on how we can make the public the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| voters aware of the changes. And of course the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| thing is the locations. If you could talk a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| to that. Right. I understand your concern. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| you know we want this to be successful. And if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| story election day is that thousands of people went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| to their polls to try to vote and they didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| what to do then it's not going to work. And we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| a number of plans in mind. You mentioned the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| out by law. We are required to send a mail out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| every registered voter in the city. It's part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| enabling legislation with the pilot project. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| are working going to work very closely with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| schools. The schools are our natural allies in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| where most of the voting takes place now is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| schools and the school personnel is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| ready and able to tell voters when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| No. You know this is where you need to go to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| today. The reason they're the natural allies is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| while they have been most gracious with us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| worked with us and having elections they agree as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| well as a lot of people that we really don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| to be in schools anymore. It's just a it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| security concern having strangers go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| schools. It's just things have changed. It's not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| way it used to be. So they're going to be helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| us in that regard. And I've also I'm going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| to get volunteers to help to literally go for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| example to school elementary and stand there in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| parking lot. And when people pull in to say you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| know they've moved the voting place down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Western Plaza. So I think the combination of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| and I think we'll get a tremendous amount of media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| coverage on this. It is something new. It's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| innovation. It's an attempt to modernize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| system. I think you'll see a lot of a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| on the media. And we may even do like a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| service announcement. What do you put in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| mailers. Is it all going to be the same. We will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| put the specific locations where we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| going. And that's the second part of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| asked me. We're in the process of we listen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| what you said earlier and have changed have got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| more locations in closer to the city. I've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| map up there and I gave you all a map of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| we're looking at. Some of them will be open the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| whole time. Obviously we can't have nine or 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| open the whole time. It would just be too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| cost-prohibitive. Maybe in the future when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| state law changes and we have like election week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| or something we could be open that much. But what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| we're looking at is having five or six open the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| whole time and then another four that open the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| last four or five three or four days. The number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| one issue here is voter participation. But it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| you indicated that we would save money. And you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| know we spend a lot of monies on elections here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Knox County. How much money will this save us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Well I think you're going to see at least a 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| percent savings in payroll. And I've really never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| tried to sell this savings because I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Miss Roddy. And that is I have to be careful how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| to word this. But you know we're not just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| trying to save money. We're about trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| the voter experience better to make it easier and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| less confusing for people to vote. The reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| you'll save is you have more flexibility. You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| open sites for just three or four days with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| election with precinct voting election day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| precinct voting. You're stuck. You have to have at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| least five workers at a precinct and you take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| one precinct that had six voters the other one had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| nine voters for a city race and you have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| amount of fixed cost whether you have 450 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| show up at a place or whether you have six. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| this will give us the flexibility. And in the long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| run. Now this one we will have to pay for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| mailing out of our normal cost. In other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| we'll be able to take that out of the budget. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| if we ever did it again it would save at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| fifty thousand dollars per election. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| there'll be substantial savings. Well I've thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| through it and from every angle and I really can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| find anything wrong with it. So I think I intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| to support it. Thank you. Council Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Becker. Thank you Mr. Mayor. I guess first off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| just to move things along I think I'll make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| motion to approve. Second. Thank you. Second just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| for folks who are watching this now. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| point out that we've already had two long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| discussions about this issue. We had a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| hearing and a workshop already to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| So at some level you just hit it home and say well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| you didn't think about that. It's entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| possible. We already have thought about that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| and wanted folks to know. I guess I wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| one thing and I don't want to ask Mr. McKay a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| question but sort of to toss out a challenge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| this is a pilot project. You know then and part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| what we need to do with the pilot project is be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| clear on how we learn to do better in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| and how other people. I mean the really cool part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| about this is folks from all over the country will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| be learning from what we do if we adopt this. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| some interesting things on Ms. Roddy's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| about what site should be open on election day. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| be wonderful to think out how do we figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| where are those sites where we do have folks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| are are walking to vote are you know are not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| getting in a car and turning right versus left to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| go vote. Because again it is about getting more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| people to vote. And I hope Mr. McKay that prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| the start of this you'll have some good plans on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| how to collect the data to know how to analyze it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| well and be able to do a much better job the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| time out. So. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Councilman Hawkless I think was the next line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| thought. Well I think there's a lot of rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| for trying new things when it looks to me it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| like there's going to be a benefit. Other than some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| potential cost savings I'm still struggling to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| the benefit in this and one of the concerns I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| is that in looking at the effects that early voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| has had has had over the years it doesn't seem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| increase voter turnout or voter response at all. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| to me that's the key issue is whether or not people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| are going to engage more in the political process or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| we're simply trying to make it easier. Somebody at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| one of the meetings prior when we discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| talked about how we're a convenience oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| society and people like to be able to. I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| remember the examples they gave but it was it had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| do with convenient shopping and convenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| activities of other kinds. And I I don't really see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| voting that way is something we should make easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| like pulling through a drive in bank or drive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| restaurant. I think it it's a it's an obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| that a citizenship obligation and people should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| take it seriously. And it's not that I'm against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| innovation I just struggle with the rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| this and I wonder if it's going to further erode the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| connection that people make through their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| communities with the political process and the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| we've been set up in the past with precincts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| wards. And I don't know that it will but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| know that it won't. So I'm just struggling to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| the real rationale and to me saving a few dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| if we're not going to increase voter turnout and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| voter engagement. I have trouble justifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| Thank you. I'm going to go to Councilman Booker next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| You know the term convenience voting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| interesting to me when there will be a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| people who are inconvenienced in the process. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| look at the map you gave and I see that there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| be a number of people who have to struggle to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| to a voting place. I have studied voting patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3296)|
| 0:55:05| in this town. I haven't been there but I've read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| about voting patterns since 1869 to see what people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| do. And in one of those elections a sheriff of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| Knox County won by one vote. A mayor in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| won by 28 votes. In a city council race there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| a tie between two people. So every vote counts. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| I think we ought to bend over backwards to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| sure that everybody in this community has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| right to vote. And I believe this plan will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| curtail limit or prohibit some people from getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| to the polls. And I just can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| Councilman Pillow. Well I should just say ditto and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| stop there. But you know I won't. I just I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| think Councilman Booker has made some extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| good points. And they were points that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| brought up have been discussed by us in these in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| these hearings. I have a problem with the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| convenience relating to this map. And Mr. McCain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| knows that we've had conversations about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| And I had hoped to see some maybe some better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| recommendations and solutions before we came to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| this decision making process. I have to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| with Councilman Roddy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| to me at this point in time given what we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| look at tonight this process is terribly flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| This is a very important election for the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Knoxville. The majority of this council is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| leave office and we will have a new majority. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| I think it is very important to each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| individuals as a candidate to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| to have access to and for the voters to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| access to the opportunity to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| regarding whether or not they will be serving. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| it just troubles me that we're going into a kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| of a funky little pilot that nobody has in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| opinion really considered in terms of access at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| time when we're going to be changing really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| you might say the majority on this council. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| personally would prefer to wait until we are under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| a different state mandate or whatever the word is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| that I should be using there so that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| more input into how this structure is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| work. I agree that we need frankly I think 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| days is too long. I think many things can happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| in the course of an election where a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| one thought one knew well will turn out to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| somebody that doesn't sound so appealing 20 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| later. So I would prefer a shorter time. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| certainly prefer better locations. I think in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| areas that it's difficult to achieve access in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| city that is where we have limited the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| opportunities for a place to vote. So as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| I really struggled with this and I realized that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| lot of thought has evidently gone into this but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| somehow that thought just simply does not does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| allow me to support this. So I cannot support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| this convenience plan that's before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Well when I first heard of convenience voting I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| sort of very skeptical in the beginning and then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| really sort of dawned on me my wife being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| registrar at Ridgedale off and on not the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| elections but before that would always indicate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| me the frustration she had because she would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| one of the people that when somebody came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| wanting to vote that she'd have to tell that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| they're not registered to vote there. They were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| supposed to go somewhere else and sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| depending upon how busy they are and stuff that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| not a real easy thing to tell somebody that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| need to go somewhere else. And depending upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| time of the evening that they do come in that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| can really present a problem if they come in at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| seven thirty and they've got to go from they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| to go 15 miles. A lot of these folks I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| anything to back this up. I'm just assuming do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| go vote. And that concerns me because I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| that every vote is important. And then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| another aspect of it that because I have been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| precinct chairman at Ridgedale and it's been my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| responsibility to try to obtain workers at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| precinct and and over the years that has gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| harder and harder for the simple reason is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| people that we've had that we have used to do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| work the elections are aging at a tremendous rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| and it's hard to get younger people because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| tried to to want to do these jobs. And so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| losing that and it's getting harder and harder to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| get those folks. I'm willing to give this a try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| because I do think in in the concept of it we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| have better trained workers because they will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| more than one day for one thing. And we'll need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| less of them. I'm fairly confident. And it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| just for one election. And I figure that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| probably worth giving it a shot just to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| outcome. Thank you. OK. Seeing no Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Frost. Somebody else had their light on. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| struggled with this a bit. I was you know concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| from our workshop where we had just one location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| south of the river. I still have a little concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| about that but I'm glad to see we've got location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| south of 640 other than at the courthouse where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| we're required to have one open. I'm not concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| about the you know the nomenclature involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| this process. Low voting turnout is not a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| problem that the city of Knoxville has. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| looked at voting records in other Tennessee cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| and you know most recently Chattanooga had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| council race down there. I think the winner got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| something like 750 votes. It's not like I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| it's not specific to Knoxville. I think we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| fair opportunity to see what will happen. Yes. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| know some might call it an experiment and in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| regard it is. But if you're going to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| something that is hopefully going to result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| better turnout there always has to be a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| You know I certainly will miss going to vote where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| I vote. I only early vote if I'm out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| because I like going and you know saying hi to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| folks. I will miss that come this fall. But if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| are able to find a solution that will increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| citizen participation first and foremost and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| the only consideration in my mind I'd support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| maybe if it even costs more money if we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| we'd get more people participating. So I plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| support it. Ms. Roddy. Mr. McKay. What kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| system do you plan to have in place to solicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| citizens satisfaction or dissatisfaction with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| following the election. Would there be a place on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| the Election Commission website where folks could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| could register and leave their comments. The reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| why I ask is I know Mr. Bailey said that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| had not heard from anybody that was against it. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| actually although I plan to support this and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| a very poignant conversation with a gentleman who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| physically limited and enjoys walking to his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| precinct accompanied by a neighbor and felt that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| would not be able to get to these convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| centers and said that he would be he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| reduced to absentee voting. And I know there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| provision for older members of our population or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| those who have limitations to vote by mail. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| was just heartbreaking to me because obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| being in his precinct and being a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| community and it is a precinct where folks walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| to their community is very important to him. So I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| like to know that there's some way to close this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| loop. If this does pass tonight and as this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| trial where we can get some feedback. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| that's a good good question and I'm open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| suggestions on how we would do that. That's that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| a good idea to try to get some input. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| worked with the Baker Center in the past. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| done some polling for us. Maybe they'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| interested in helping us. And also in the law the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| coordinator of elections in Nashville is supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| to report to the state legislature about how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| went. So that'll be another another way to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| that. You know I think anything Internet based is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| probably the simplest way. Not everybody has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Internet access but they can certainly find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| it at the public library or the grandkids do or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| something. Yeah. If there was some way that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| Election Commission website could have a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3890)|

| 1:05:09| to that will indicate to you that the pilot was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| successful. I would think I don't I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| set it up to where you know the turnout is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| relying on so many different factors. Everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| from the weather to the candidates to how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3922)|

| 1:05:27| to run for office all of you I'll bet you all went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| back and looked at election results for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| two elections. That's what you do. That's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| eight year period in order to get an idea how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| many votes am I going to have to have to win this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| race. So I really don't think you just have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| election and base the whole thing on turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| because there are so many different factors. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| I would be looking at is if election day if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| turn on the television or the next day and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| read the paper and there's hundreds of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| saying I went to vote at this place. I didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| anything about it. There was nobody there to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| me where to go. I didn't get to vote. Then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| failed. Then it didn't work. I would think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| the ability of the voter to get across to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3962)|

| 1:06:15| part and try to make sure that they find out about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| this. If we have to call them on the telephone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| tell them you know we could have the early vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=3980)|

| 1:09:47| These have these properties already been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| I don't believe they have. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I noticed the census tracts have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Are they all in the first district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| These are the census tracts that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| that they're hoping to find the property in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| There are limited tracts where these funds can be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| And KHP is targeting those three tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| If they can't find eligible properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| then they can look in other census tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| I mean I would assume one of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| is they're within the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| No this actually is not empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| This is there's a different map for neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| stabilization actually. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Well I mean some of that some of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Maybe I should have phrased it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Are some of the criteria identifying these census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| tracts similar criteria to those that determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| whether or not they were in the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| Not necessarily. It has more to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| If you could come to the microphone Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| Yeah the census tracts are qualified by HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| based on a foreclosure risk and vacancy risk score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| So it's something totally separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| from the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| This is something that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| based on the foreclosure problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| that the country is in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| So some of these census tracts may be in the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| but some of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| I was just I was just wondering why everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| was targeted to one district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| when you have foreclosures and there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| different projects that are funded under neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| stabilization program funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| If you remember at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| you approved a contract with Habitat for Humanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| to do the same type of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| and they're focused in other census tracts in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| Knox Housing Partnership chose these census tracts to work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4303)|

| 1:15:12| Ms. Roddy, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| This is for Mr. Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| and I was fortunate enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| to attend the Healthcare 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| seminar earlier this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| and heard a lot of innovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| and ideas that other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| are doing and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| that came across all our desks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| recently was from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I believe, the Tennessee Municipal League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| and they were singling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| communities that were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| innovative things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4533)|
| 1:15:33| and in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| they have a health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| primary care center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| like we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4538)|
| 1:15:38| in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| but they've recently added a pharmacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| and are able to dispense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| generic drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| at a very competitive price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| and they're saving quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| on their total health care costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| for their employee population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Is that something that's in the hopper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| in terms of looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| as we expand employees acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| and use of the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| as the go to place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| for preventative health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Is that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4565)|
| 1:16:05| that we might be able to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Well, the short answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| It's not on our list today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| but we continuously look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| at various things, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| to improve our wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| and health programs that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| And we will certainly have an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| in how that is working in in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| We think that our health center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| is an integral part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| of our overall health plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| We think what if y'all approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| this extension or expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| of the summit contract tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| will be a step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| because in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| as if you recall, we talked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| in the budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| will allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| through this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4601)|

| 1:16:48| management aspect of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| So we have a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| that we're trying to do today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| that we think are are innovative for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Pharmacy is not one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| that we have tackled yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| but we will watch closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| what happens in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| and the merits of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| And if it has merit for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| we'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4626)|

| 1:17:31| Martin again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I noticed that in the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| on this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| it references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| claims that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| under workers' compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| And I wondered what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| we're doing as an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| to try to address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| in terms of worker safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| so that those claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| well, so we have fewer claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| Good, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| And there actually has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| progress in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Obviously, it starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4678)|

| 1:18:10| And our actual workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| comp claims are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| If you look at 07 and 08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| the number of the claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| and and have shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| some good progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| If you noticed in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| there is an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| in the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| And that's driven by some rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| large, the few in numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| but large claims that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Workers' comp claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| have a long maturity cycle to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| And so it takes a while for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| to reach some of these levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| And we've unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| had some that that have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| They're still in the single digit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| numbers as far as the number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| But they're reaching some large numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| and in total claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| And that's what's driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| that change in the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| number that's moved it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| to the over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| But if you look at the underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| core issues of workers' comp claims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| those are decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| We think we're making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| We have a new person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| in our risk management area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| that will be our safety officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| being focused on those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| continuing those and enhancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| them where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| And when will this history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| so to speak, fall fall off for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| How many years does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Well, no, that's that's a hard question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| because it's unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| to each of those those claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| and how long they they last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| in public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| They're mostly where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| They're driven more by medical claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| If you look at KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| they're not as much medical claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| as they are psychological issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| and those sort of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| which lend themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| more to settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| So medical claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| tend to extend themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| while the others reach settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| So some of these are just going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| to play out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| And it's hard to predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| how long that could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4813)|

| 1:20:44| Ms. McGinnis is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| and she pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| there's a in the heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| there's a Scrivener's error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| where I'd like to move to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| eight hundred thirty thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| one hundred and forty eight dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4856)|

| 1:21:01| one hundred and thirteen dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| And she can address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| It's in the body of the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| the correct dollar figure is in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| and it just didn't translate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| into the heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Eight forty one one three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| should be the correct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| OK. And it's in the body someplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| It's in the attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| Second. OK, bingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| OK, so I guess that literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| that's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4894)|

| 1:21:41| Eight hundred and forty thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| thirteen dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| OK. Oh, eight forty zero one three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4904)|

| 1:21:47| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| We just saved a hundred bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Any other comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| OK, now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4917)|

| 1:22:23| Quick question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Martin, I see that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| is getting involved as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| you know, as part of the quid pro quo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| that it really is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| going to cost the city a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| I might have missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Are there provisions in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| they're going to be tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| people's health care claims of secrecy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| And some things I saw people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| are being identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| you know, potential social security numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| And there's going to be at least two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| white papers issued on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| and other people are going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| employees health information is protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Council member Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| that's a that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| I'm glad you ask it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| because we have given that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| a great deal of attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| both from a HIPAA standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| and total privacy for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| And there they will be subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| to the HIPAA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| They will there will be in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| a business associate agreement here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| which is required in any exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| of this type of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| And it will be part and parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| of our arrangement with Navigator MD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| That's the whole question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Some of the requirements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| Someone has to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5017)|

| 1:24:59| in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| And we're curious as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| what exactly this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5102)|

| 1:25:13| that are in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| And they were wanting to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| if we were banning them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| from putting stuff outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5118)|

| 1:25:24| I know you've already told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| but I'd like to go out to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5125)|

| 1:25:29| Let me back up just one quick second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| before I answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| And so clearly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| the ordinance speaks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| is within the central business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| in the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| It prohibits sitting in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| on public sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5141)|

| 1:25:44| and nine in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| There's also a clause that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| well, it says no person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| shall sit or lie down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5149)|

| 1:25:52| placed on a public sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| You can still place an object out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| but you cannot sit or lie on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| during that period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| is what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| So this does not inhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| placing goods, antiques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| on the sidewalk for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5164)|

| 1:26:10| asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5170)|

| 1:26:12| by the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090630?start=5172)|
