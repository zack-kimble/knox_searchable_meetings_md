| 2:04:01| the end result may actually result in increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| public funds that we can spend in homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| and housing and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| So with that understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| I feel that I will support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| There's always unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| It's still early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| There is gonna be public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| and I will continue to have those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| But at this stage, I just don't see a downside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| in delaying or continuing with this aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7476)|
| 2:04:44| And then also understand that if the stadium is not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7484)|
| 2:04:50| then this possible action of the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| would basically just be null and void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| It would just go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| So with that understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| I'm gonna support this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| but not without a whole lot of thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| and continued scrutiny as we go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7512)|

| 2:09:14| Hey, I do think that this is a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| I did have a couple of questions for Mr. Kellogg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| just on the acquisition of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| And I understand that the city is doing 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| and from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| AMBC is obviously doing the other 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| Fundraising is underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| I didn't know if you could share a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| kind of how far into that that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| And then, just talk about the raising of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| and then, is it gonna be loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| Is it gonna be a cash transaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| I'm just kind of curious, sort of the outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| Matthew Kellogg, who's head of Appalachia Mountain Bike Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| If you could go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7807)|
| 2:10:07| and answer Council Member Testerman's questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Thanks again to everybody, including the mayor and council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| for even considering this addition of green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| Matthew Kellogg with the Appalachia Mountain Bike Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| 6110 Burnett Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| So we are, and my board has tasked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| with fundraising the $100,000 of our portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| to come out of newly raised funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| And we are in process of taking donations right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| We are doing well on that front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| and have raised approximately $70,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| towards our $100,000 commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| And so we are looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| to making it to our closing date with the cash on hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| to bring up our side of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| We will be doing that through a number of avenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| but you'll notice in the month of April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| a social media campaign that will allow the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| to donate towards this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| of which they can already do on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| ambcnox.org forward slash donate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7884)|
| 2:11:25| And then just, if for some reason you aren't able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| to raise the full amount by the closing date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| then what is, just out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| do you plan to finance or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| We have the sufficient cash on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7895)|
| 2:11:38| It would be an executive board and a board vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| to allocate those funds from our general account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| But as I mentioned, we plan to do all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| out of a new fundraising effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| This property and project was not on our radar at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| with the 2021 budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| And so we wanted to make sure to keep this separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| from our standard maintenance budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| and our other park projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| that we have on the rolls already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| I just want to applaud AMBC and Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| and those other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| There's all types of those types of nonprofits in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| that move in and either secure land through purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| or through easement or through gift and donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| And then this is the model that built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| the urban wilderness we love now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| which is where those organizations move first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| and the city comes in with support in a secondary manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| So I'm really thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Also, I want to give a shout out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| to a lot of the South Knoxville neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| have already started contributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| So kudos for AMBC for leading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| but also engaging the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| right there near William Hasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=7985)|

| 2:13:33| 11 D is a resolution respectfully requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| the Knoxville Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| to consider and make a recommendation to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| regarding the possible addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| of architectural design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| to CG one zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| and the reinstitution of planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| Motion made to approve by Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| Seconded by Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| We've had several items come up recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| where architectural design standards and CG one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| have, I think, been a part of our discussion together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8051)|
| 2:14:16| It certainly seemed like having some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| architectural standards there would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| To put this in context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| what we're really talking about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| not having the back of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| facing the front of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| So that's, I don't think, what anyone's intention was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| I would, however, like to make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| And I'd like to make a motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| to remove the request regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| I'm supportive of looking into planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8086)|
| 2:14:52| But in conversation with Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| I think there's a plan for a more thorough review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| of land use and a future council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| I think that that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| that discussion in that workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| will probably be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| in kind of thinking about the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| of what this might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| So I would make that motion to remove that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| but go ahead and approve the design standards for CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| Okay, motion made to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| as Council Member Roberto described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| Is there a second by Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| Any questions or discussion about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| Seeing none, I'll call the roll call vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| Does everyone understand the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| Okay, seeing no questions or discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| please conduct a roll call vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8144)|

| 2:18:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Just one note, and that is one of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| that you passed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Excuse me, tonight, my consent was 11U.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| And in glance at your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| that is to approve the pension for Robin Tipton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| This time next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| Robin will be retiring from the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| One of the things that is fun to bring to you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8314)|
| 2:18:39| and some of the things that you don't get to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| we say when there's contract increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| but you rarely get to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| when it comes in well below the budget anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| And that happens a lot more than most of us realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8330)|
| 2:18:53| Robin has been a phenomenal gatekeeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| of the city's resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| and a professional and respected engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| interacting with the construction community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| who has the respect of many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| And so much of what you see in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| yes, it is an amendment to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| I hope you notice that the overall price of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| is less than originally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| And a lot of credit has to go to Robin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| And so publicly, I say thanks to her on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| And if you get to say that personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| I encourage you to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| because she makes a lot of the projects happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| in your districts that have been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8371)|

| 2:21:35| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| Absolutely, my name is Megan Murphy-Boutwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| My address is 4426 Aylesbury Drive, right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| I'm in the Wingate subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| right off of Washington Pike, just past Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| Excited to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| speaking in favor of Resolution 10-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| I have lived in Wingate for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| celebrating my 15th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| I'm a small business owner, as well as a homeowner out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| And we've heard talk of the Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| widening project for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| And when we were invited as a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| to participate in the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| Office of Neighborhood Empowerment Zoom call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| it was really exciting to hear the collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| the information, the feedback that was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| from the homeowners that are out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| It was really great to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| I've also had the privilege of serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| on our Homeowners Association Board for the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| which has given us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| to talk to other homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| We've brought it up at our most recent annual meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| to get their feedback and anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| of these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| We just wanna pass on that there's a lot of excitement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| and desire to work with the groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8568)|
| 2:22:55| that are looking for feedback on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| because of what the potential is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| For traffic flow down Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| like I said, having lived out here for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| I've seen the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| I've seen the increased traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| My husband and I also owned a small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| over at Knoxville Center Mall for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| So we've seen the growth and the development out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| As a mom driving a child to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| I also know what it's like to try to turn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| on a Washington Pike in the morning or in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| We're excited about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| of just the improvement out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| especially the feedback that we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| on the mixed-use path, the mixed-use trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| all the way down to New Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| I mean, our 148 homes in here, a lot of them have families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8616)|
| 2:23:41| a lot of them have kids that use New Harvest Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| and that area and the amenities that are over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| and are excited about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| of what this improvement could offer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| and their families out here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| So thank you again for letting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| be part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| We wanna continue as an HOA board, as neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| as good stewards of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| we wanna continue to be part of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| and we appreciate you giving us the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| And with that, I say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| and I will yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| Thank you so much, Ms. Murphy-Batwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| We have two people signed up in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| First person is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Mr. Murphy, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8663)|
| 2:24:28| I am, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| Okay, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8669)|
| 2:24:32| and address for the record and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| Certainly, Madam Mayor, and actually here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| generally in favor of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8677)|
| 2:24:40| I believe Daniel Anderson is also on the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| to speak after me, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| Yes, he signed up to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8687)|
| 2:24:47| He and I will probably switch off once or twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| We generally just let one person go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| You can take up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| and then the next person can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| It's not really a tag team type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| All right, Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| I'm out here along with Dan Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| a representative of the neighbors out on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| We'd like to thank a number of the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| that have been able to meet individually with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| over the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| This project's purpose, need, and the build option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| was set back in 2009, and some things have changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| All of us, the engineers working on the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| neighbors, passers-through, we all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| there are problems that need to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| There's congestion, a high crash rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| and a lack of pedestrian connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| But 12 years after 2009, some things have changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| and plans do need a bit of an update and tweak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| We've learned that we can't build our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| out of congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| We understand that new road projects induce changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| in land use farther out in rural areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| The city has set some important climate goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| and we're much more aware of the impact of these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| on minority and low-income communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| We must identify these and other potential issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| assess their impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| and explore some solution alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| The early phases of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| weren't really aware of all this context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| but we have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| to do a little bit of course correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| So we greatly have improved our project awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| amongst the residents out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| and we really want to thank City Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| for communicating more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| and being very committed to public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| We do still have more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| We have some more residents to reach out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| and there's more public involvement to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| One of the positive things of this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| communication, is I'm personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| getting to know some of my neighbors better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| especially the ones in Oak Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| That community has a remarkable history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| and getting to know them better has enriched my own life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| during this period of isolation of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| and I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| There are some tough issues to work through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| but our general ask is for the project design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| to be updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| leveraging some robust public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| We know that Director Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| is committed to involving the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| and our ask for you on Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| is to be concerned and involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| We'd like you to have a workshop in several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| after some additional design work is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| maybe after we spread an updated plan out on a big table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| for the public to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| We also, our understanding also is that Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| will have another opportunity to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| because the funding to actually acquire the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| will come to you separately later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| This in front of you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| is simply the engineering funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| The letter that Dan, Ronnie, and I sent you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| has been signed by another 70 supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| in a change.org petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| and as soon as that website sends me the copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| I'll send it out to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| We are comfortable moving forward tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| with Council's concern and oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| and with the commitment for communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| provided by Director Cannon and Deputies Welch and Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| Next person signed up to speak is Daniel Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| Mr. Anderson, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8871)|
| 2:27:59| Daniel Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Mr. Johnson, is he on the call, to your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| I see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| Yes, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| Okay, Mr. Anderson, it's nice to hear your voice again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| Yours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| My name is Daniel Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| I live at 3319 Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| and I am the Chairman of the Trustee Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| for Oak Grove Church that sits at 5667 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| I wanna start out first just saying a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| about Oak Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| Oak Grove community started about 160 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| Some freed slaves got land, set up house, and here we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| most of which were my family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| We take great pride in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| although over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| it's slowly been chopped from both ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| and has shrank dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| One issue that I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| and let me make a statement to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| I, too, am, I guess, a fence walker on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| I am for the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| because we really need to do something about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| It's not in the scale that it sits on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| This morning, when I was trying to cross the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| my driveway comes out on Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| at a rising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| legends of Oak Grove Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| I forget the name of the road, but anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| it sits directly across from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| When I got ready to come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| I had a car in the turning lane on my left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| a car straight across from me trying to turn left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| traffic moving in both directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| and the thought that came to my mind is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| as the plan sets, if they add two more lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8989)|
| 2:29:54| and two 10-foot sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| how in the world am I ever gonna get to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| I ended up backing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| going down the hill and going out the other end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| down at Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| around by East Town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9009)|
| 2:30:10| then back up by Mall Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| just to get to 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| We do have a serious problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| but I am all about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| Our community's been here, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9021)|
| 2:30:22| 150, 160 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9022)|
| 2:30:25| What we have, we wanna keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| I mean, I do realize that to progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| there's things that have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| We would just like this council to take it slow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| just rethink it, maybe not as big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| We're on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9042)|
| 2:30:42| We just don't wanna see our community go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| any more than it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| The last two times that they've come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| and widened the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| they have taken the property on the church side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| And every time they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| they take more property, take more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| Just looking at the map and figuring out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| after this one is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| we're probably gonna be within 40 or 50 feet of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9064)|
| 2:31:11| be it three lanes or be it five lanes there at Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| And I just don't know how we're gonna deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| but we really wanna work with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| because we really need this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| We just don't want you to take our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| And quite frankly speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| I just hope that we can work it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| so that everybody comes out at least somewhat happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| Because I mean, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| I can't get out in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| I can't get in in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9102)|
| 2:31:46| Cars are zooming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9106)|
| 2:31:47| One of the fatalities that happened up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| was right at my driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| that same road across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| And it used to be one of our neighbor's wives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9115)|
| 2:31:58| They were in a car wreck trying to pull out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| cross traffic, got broadsided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| and she died a couple of years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| I mean, a couple of weeks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| So it is something that we really need to get taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9126)|
| 2:32:11| We have a lot of elderly that have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| maneuvering across the street now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| And I'm 59, I guess I'm one of those elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| because I just don't like sticking my nose out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| and just gunning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| But that's pretty much what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| So anything that you guys can do to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| without making it a super highway would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| I mean, we need some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| and we're willing to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| We just don't wanna get squished out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| One last thing that I wanna say in 38 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9160)|
| 2:32:44| Something that was brought up last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| the last meeting we had was about these drainage pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| I am a fisherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| I'm an environmentalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| I couldn't sleep because I stayed awake all night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| thinking about those sewage pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9175)|
| 2:32:58| I would say sewage, those runoff pools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| running back into our creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| If it runs back into Babel Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| it runs into Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| If it runs into Love's Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| it runs into Spring Place Park down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| where the artesian well is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| How many times have you come by there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9191)|
| 2:33:14| and see all those kids in that creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| just about to leave you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| Thank you very much, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| Council members, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| Director Harold Cannon's here to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| any further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| Yeah, I just wanted to thank the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| I want to start with thanking city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9223)|
| 2:33:46| and Director Cannon and my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| for allowing me six weeks ago to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| to be able to have these community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| This community mix, but actually overwhelmingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9234)|
| 2:33:59| was in support of road improvements several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| when plans were changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| and the road improvements didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| This is really needed for them and their safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| as Mr. Anderson described the woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| who lost her life out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Mr. Cannon has lots of stats on the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| and I myself have been stuck in traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| trying to go different directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| trying to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| So I'm excited for the neighbors to finally have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| a plan forward and a commitment from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| to address the traffic concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| that they have to deal with every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| And Mr. Anderson, we don't want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| to pull out your nose and have to gun it to get across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| And I really, that was some serious bravery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| talking about trying to cross the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| So I look forward to us all working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| with staff and Director Cannon and CDM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| to try and address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| I want to say I really appreciate all the community's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| and it's very exciting to be able to engage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| And the biggest reason for the pause to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| was to just clarify what it is we're voting on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9306)|
| 2:35:09| And it's basically to revise and revisit the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| that got started a long time ago and shelved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| Time has changed and needs have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| And so it's time to look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| And so the community members, everybody, most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| I think I've got one phone call to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| to somebody who didn't get to ask their question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| the other day, but everybody was excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| to be able to speak on it and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| And I know that staff and CDM are going to spend time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| talking to the different community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| about their concerns and how it's going to impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| And I appreciate that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| I'll let Director Cannon fill in anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| he wants to say specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| I will say one of the reasons that we needed the six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| to meet was to talk about the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| and the traffic numbers on the different components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| and sections on the road and clarify any misunderstandings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9361)|
| 2:36:05| of different numbers because there are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| calculations and so we weeded through all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| And it's just been a good time to pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| and be able to make these connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| And I really appreciate the Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| setting up these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| And what I really look forward to is us being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| to have a meeting maybe around a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| in an open air environment, like the park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| because I think that will be really beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| to have some one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9394)|
| 2:36:35| So I'm hoping that as time goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| we're gonna have the ability to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| even if we have to do it in small individual groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| and spread it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| And the only other thing I'll say is I'm excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| to hear the enthusiasm like the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| and from one of the speakers today about the multi-use path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| that is so exciting to be able to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| all these neighborhoods to the park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| to the groceries, restaurants, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| so they don't have to get in their cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| and or cross the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| So it's an exciting project and I'm glad to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| that you guys have waited patiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| to resolve your traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9431)|
| 2:37:19| Thank you, Council Member Ryder, Council Member Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| and Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| Yes, I enjoyed the discussion that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| with the residents this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| And just for clarification, it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| that us taking this next step as far as funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| doesn't commit to any particular design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| that those discussions will continue to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| And so it's somewhat open-ended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| about what the final design will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| So at this stage, I feel comfortable going ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| I'm not sure what the final design is yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| if it's funding it, but the neighbors and Mr. Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| will continue to have conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| that they've already began to try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| what's the best solution to these problems out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| Thank you, Council Member Thomas, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| If moving forward, following public discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| if there is a decision made to scale back this project a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| that could have a significant impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| on the budget of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| what would that mean since we had already approved it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9512)|
| 2:38:39| Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| Yes, ma'am, Harold Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9521)|
| 2:38:42| Director of Engineering, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| Council Member Parker, when I came on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| with the city in June, about a month later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| is when I started going through the list of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| that seemed to be stalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| This is one of them, as you've heard earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| This goes back to 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| and basically went into a stall pattern in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| One of the first charges that I asked CDM to undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| is do we need everything that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9550)|
| 2:39:14| on those plans that were completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| Generally speaking, the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| Five lanes is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| We have refined that here lately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| to where unfortunately today's traffic counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9566)|
| 2:39:32| excuse me, necessitate five lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| from Mill Road to Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| It's just that's the volumes that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| And that's not even our counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| because we have been, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| back checking it through TPO and TDOT counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| There's also a fixed number of lanes that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9587)|
| 2:39:51| as you get in front of target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| trying to work towards the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| But in between, we've been able to adjust this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| That has translated into significant dollar savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| If we went forward with the 2015 plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| you would be looking at well over $21 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| in construction costs, construction and right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9608)|
| 2:40:13| Under this plan, we're looking at just north of 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| And that may be refined more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| So, but I'm, if we can refine it, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9621)|
| 2:40:26| Because quite frankly, that allows us and you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| to reallocate dollars to other places in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| that have the needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| I think we're closing in on about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| what the budget will have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| given that we have to address traffic concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| but we also have to address the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| and bicycling public needs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| I hope I'm answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| It does to some degree, but it tells me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| further action would need to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| to reallocate those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| Please correct me if that's not what you're meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| No, it's, and here's the reality part, Councilwoman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| and that is this project was approved way back when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| when it had a $12 million overall project budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| So we're well above what Council's proceeding you all needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| and we've just been trying to trim it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| as much as possible and still be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| The only thing, other thing I wanted to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| is I really appreciated the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| members of the neighborhood coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| and meeting with me and sharing this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| and sharing the history of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| And I just wanted to stress the importance of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9706)|
| 2:41:51| you know, listening to those community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| who are very concerned with how their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| will be impacted and what will be left for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| to pass on to, you know, future generations of their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9723)|
| 2:42:09| I would hate for us in implementing this road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| to recreate past mistakes and past harms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| that result in an historic African-American community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| in our city being severely negatively impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| and having their, you know, their potential future wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| for future generations reduced through this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| We should be very careful as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| to limit the project to meet the needs of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| while also taking in consideration the value of their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| that they're trying to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9773)|

| 2:43:09| knows that that's pretty much been Anderson country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| out there in that area for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| as Mr. Anderson stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| And I do appreciate the delay in order for community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| to be able to express their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9802)|

| 2:43:26| And I actually appreciate also that they are willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| to have more conversation around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| And I also want to thank, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| Reverend Dixon as well for helping to lead the charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| and community members who were just out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| and just expressing their thoughts and opinions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| So I want to also recognize Council Member Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9824)|
| 2:43:49| for her efforts as well and helping to pull all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| of these meetings together in opposite neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9832)|
| 2:43:55| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| Deputy Mayor McKenzie, you know the respect I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9838)|

| 2:44:05| Quite frankly, there's a bigger club hanging over my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| And that is my understanding is Sam Anderson's mom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| joins the roadway and goes to church out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9854)|

| 2:44:37| you can state the number that what we are approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9877)|

| 2:44:45| So that's part of what we're approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| And that is a commitment to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9890)|

| 2:44:54| We're not one and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| My hope is that you all will see this as a benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| for how we can involve the community in projects like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=9902)|

| 2:46:49| I just wanted to ask a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| to Deputy of the Mayor Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| What is the anticipated completion date for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10014)|
| 2:47:01| Thank you very much for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| And good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| because it's been out there a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| So we would hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| we're actually starting to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| with the selected playground contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| And so we hope to have that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| before Council here soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| hopefully by this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10037)|
| 2:47:21| and have a new Fort Kidd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| and obviously the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| with the ADA connection this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| So that's the anticipated time schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10048)|

| 2:57:02| As was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| one of the other measures put forward tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| is going to have some more marketing associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| And I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| And I hope that that is a focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| And also I would request that as eviction dockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| are put forward in the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| that the city would make resources available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| to the individuals named and reach out to those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10640)|
| 2:57:24| and let them know that rental assistance is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| This is good for our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| and it's good for the landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| And it saves effort and time with our court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| if people can just pay their bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| and move on with their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| So this measure and the funding, it needs to go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10656)|
| 2:57:43| I'm sorry, I thought I had another paragraph here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| but I think I've reached the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| So please vote in favor of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10666)|
| 2:57:49| and please pass more like it and provide more funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| as even with the additional 50 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| that may be covered under this measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| we're not nearly fulfilling the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| of the citizens of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10680)|
| 2:58:01| Thank you, and I yield back the remainder of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| Council members, no one else has signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| You have any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| Becky Wade is here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| Council member Smith, and then Cal Parker, and then Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10693)|
| 2:58:17| Just gonna ask Director Wade if she could explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| how outreach works for this particular item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| and other related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| Yeah, thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| This is Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10711)|
| 2:58:32| Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| When we rolled out our housing assistance program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| we used 211 as the central contact agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10718)|
| 2:58:44| or number call center where people could access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| potential assistance with their housing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| We did that so that they could be directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| to the appropriate agency that is serving that population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| because some agencies are serving homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| with mortgage assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| some agencies are serving seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| and others are serving families like CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10747)|
| 2:59:13| So we hoped that the general public would understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| that that was the place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| They tracked all the calls that came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| and from there, they were provided a warm handoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10762)|
| 2:59:26| basically a hold on, we'll transfer the call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| to the agency that can assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| Okay, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10773)|
| 2:59:38| I also wanted to just add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| I spent some time with some of the CAC outreach workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10779)|
| 2:59:46| over the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| And to the extent there's some still folks watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10787)|
| 2:59:51| there was a discussion earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| about our asks of state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| And one of those I think should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| that we could all unite behind is related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| mental health and addiction treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| We don't have enough facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| or treatment centers in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| So that's an area where the state can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| So just want to make that plug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| that that is something that we've asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| of the state representatives and senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| So it's something really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| and something that CAC sees firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| And it's a way that the state can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10826)|
| 3:00:29| So just wanted to add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10832)|
| 3:00:33| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10833)|
| 3:00:34| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| Wanted to help understanding the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10836)|
| 3:00:42| that was made about the request for assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| being lower than anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| I thought based on the calls into 211,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10847)|
| 3:00:51| there was a long list of thousands of folks in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| but not the funding for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| When we had an issue come before us previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| The Leadership Foundation or another group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| who is providing rental assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| and needed additional money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| and had projected that they would serve 200 clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| but it was lower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| I thought they had reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10879)|
| 3:01:22| that there were thousands on a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| So I'm just trying to better understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| do we have folks on a waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| waiting for assistance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| Director Wade, if you could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| And I know Misty Goodwin from CAC is also available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| to try to answer our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Right, Misty Goodwin could probably provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| detailed information about their waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| but I can tell you one thing that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| And that was the amount of assistance per household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| that was allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10910)|
| 3:01:51| And so initially it was at a lower amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| and then we were able to go up to $3,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| and extend that for more months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| which most households needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| And so that decreased the number of households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| we were able to serve with our funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| I can say that with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| receiving the treasury funds of 14 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| we will be able to serve households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| across the city and the county with rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| And that can pay for rearages as well as going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| So I know there's still need out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| but I feel like with the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| that has come to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| we will be able to meet most of that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| Misty, do you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| Yeah, I was actually gonna say the same thing, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| So right now we do not have a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| We are trying to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10966)|
| 3:02:47| If you could just remind us everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| for the record of your position with CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| Sure, this is Misty Goodwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| social services director at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| And right now we do not have a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10976)|
| 3:02:59| We are working through the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10979)|
| 3:03:00| for the housing assistance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| And we did come back to ask for additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10982)|
| 3:03:07| just to be able to serve the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10987)|
| 3:03:08| that we had pending that needed payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10988)|
| 3:03:12| But Becky is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| We originally started out with an amount of 1500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| thinking that would help those that were in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=10997)|
| 3:03:23| And what we found is that we really needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| to up that amount to 3000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11005)|
| 3:03:26| And so that did then yield in less families being served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| but with more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| And so I will say, even though this is extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| through the end of March of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| we are likely to spend the additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| by the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11023)|
| 3:03:44| And there is a new program kicking off Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| through Knox County and the treasury funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| And it will be able to help a lot more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| with a lot more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| So at this point, if folks need rental assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11036)|
| 3:04:00| there is funding available and they can call 211| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| to access that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| And they will either get immediate support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| and go on a waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| but they should not be turned down for rental assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11053)|
| 3:04:16| if they qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11056)|
| 3:04:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| Okay, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11059)|

| 3:04:25| Ms. Wade, so part of this agenda item is a case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11065)|
| 3:04:30| Is that funding for an existing or is it an additional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11070)|
| 3:04:37| That's an existing position that will be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| Okay, is that one at CAC then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11080)|
| 3:04:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11084)|

| 3:04:48| And one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| Is CAC distributing all the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| or does CAC have member agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| that they distribute through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| For this particular contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| CAC is distributing those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| Now, when we get into the treasury money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| there will be several agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| that will be distributing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| and CAC will be handling the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11110)|
| 3:05:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11115)|

| 3:10:48| If you could start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11448)|
| 3:10:50| for the record, and then you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| Yes, Brady Watson, I live at 229 Haywood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| I appreciate Council and Mayor taking time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11457)|
| 3:11:00| to hear from me this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11460)|
| 3:11:02| Yeah, I definitely wanted to speak in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11464)|
| 3:11:06| I think, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11466)|
| 3:11:08| it's a pretty serious issue in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| We see folks without houses all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11471)|
| 3:11:16| and frankly, it seems to be a growing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| So I think this is certainly something that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| and it could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11481)|
| 3:11:22| And as was mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11482)|
| 3:11:23| it's something that we have historically not invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| on the state level in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11487)|
| 3:11:29| So I'm glad to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| You know, and I'd like to also speak to the larger issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| of the houseless folks in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| As Tyler mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| I've also knocked doors on homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| that people have faced eviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11503)|
| 3:11:44| and many of them, some of them didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| they were being evicted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11507)|
| 3:11:48| They didn't know there were resources available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| Some of them faced language barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| And so I think, it seems to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| the city can certainly do more to do outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11518)|
| 3:11:59| And for the folks that aren't able to get housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| for whatever issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| I really hate to see folks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| having their belongings and tents bulldozed, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| I know it's happened several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11531)|
| 3:12:12| and it seems to be we can do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| I know as a city, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11535)|
| 3:12:16| it's not something I don't think represents our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| as Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11539)|
| 3:12:20| And I think, you know, regardless of the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| that doesn't seem like an appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11543)|
| 3:12:24| you know, course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| You know, most Americans can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11547)|
| 3:12:28| an unexpected $500 bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| Many Americans are living in a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| Many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11554)|
| 3:12:36| And I know, you know, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11556)|
| 3:12:39| I would be really, really struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| if I missed a paycheck for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11561)|
| 3:12:42| So there are many reasons folks wind up without housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11562)|
| 3:12:46| And I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| we as a city should do better by those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| I know it's not an easy problem to solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| but I think that, again, we can do better by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| And yeah, but I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11577)|
| 3:13:00| I think this is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| I think there's underlying issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| that folks, you know, need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| And in the meantime, I would just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| that we try to work out some sort of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| to treat these folks a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| You know, they are human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| and I don't think anyone should be treated like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11596)|
| 3:13:17| So I will yield the rest of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11597)|
| 3:13:20| and thank you for taking time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11600)|
| 3:13:23| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| Our next person signed up to speak is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11605)|
| 3:13:29| Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| Hello again, my name is Tyler Givens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| and I reside at 1823 Explorer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| Thank you for allowing me to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11618)|
| 3:13:39| on so many issues this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| I'm glad that issues affecting the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| keep being brought forward in the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| With as large and as persistent a homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11625)|
| 3:13:48| as we have here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11628)|
| 3:13:49| and with a number of predictions waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11629)|
| 3:13:50| for processing in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| it is important that the city continue to consider measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| to serve this population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11635)|
| 3:13:56| and mitigate the impact of this ongoing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| I only wish this ordinance would go further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| and allow inpatient and overnight services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11642)|

| 3:14:06| The mayor likes to say that CARM is only 80% full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11646)|
| 3:14:09| but she doesn't mention that the foyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| the low barrier shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11651)|
| 3:14:12| has been full every night since it opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| Nor does she mention that our last point in time count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| indicated about 800 homeless people every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| with less than 400 total emergency beds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| If 400 people are sleeping rough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| and 20% of a shelter's beds are empty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11665)|
| 3:14:28| I would think that indicates something is wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| with the shelter, not something wrong with 400 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| In the past few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11675)|
| 3:14:36| I've spent a lot of time in a few homeless encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11676)|
| 3:14:38| trying to help as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11678)|
| 3:14:40| but mostly learning about the people trying to survive there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| and the issues they face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11682)|
| 3:14:45| I've been bringing just water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| for folks to fill whatever containers they already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11687)|
| 3:14:52| It's hard to describe the feeling I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| when a couple living in a tent thanked me so profusely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11694)|
| 3:14:57| for filling the old soda bottles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| so they could wash their only pan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| and have some water for cooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| Or when a person told me the tap water from my garden hose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| was the most refreshing drink they had had in days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| Or when a person who had just had surgery on their wrist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| was so excited to have clean water to wash their wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| Or when a mobility challenge person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11716)|
| 3:15:18| scrambled around their tent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| to try to find a few more bottles to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| Or that sinking feeling when someone told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| they had missed the meals at the shelter that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| and asked if I had anything to eat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| and all I had to offer was garden hose water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11730)|
| 3:15:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| There's definitely a lot of trash in the camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| and that's what I see people complain about the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11741)|
| 3:15:42| Trash is just about the only resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| that many of these people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| Trash can become a water bottle to fill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11746)|
| 3:15:47| because dirty water is better than no water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| Trash can become fuel for a fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11750)|
| 3:15:52| in near freezing temperatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| for the folks that car won't take in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11754)|
| 3:15:55| because it's not quite cold enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| Despite the fact that the city's waste contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| won't pick up trash, even when it's bagged at the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11760)|
| 3:16:04| folks still bag and pile their trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| But eventually they run out of bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| And when homeless services provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| only disposable plates and utensils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| they don't run out of trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| The city created this problem with unjust housing policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11775)|
| 3:16:19| that benefit developers and property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| and real estate agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| You know, the kind of people who support baseball stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| After 2008, the city bought up so much distressed property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| it could have built affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11790)|
| 3:16:32| instead of selling it at a discount to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11792)|
| 3:16:34| for market rate apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| Market rate just seems to be a euphemism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| for overpriced in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| My own mortgage payment is about $500 less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| than what my house would rent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| And I have certainly not done $6,000 of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| in maintenance every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| In conclusion, please vote in favor of this measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| to provide services to people in need in more city zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| Please go further to save money and lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| by targeting the causes of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| and getting these people in homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| Thank you, and I yield back my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| Thank you, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| Just a reminder to council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| that you are having a workshop next Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| on issues related to homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| where we're expecting to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11833)|
| 3:17:14| from all the people doing this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11834)|
| 3:17:17| and looking forward to getting good information at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11837)|
| 3:17:21| Next person who signed up to speak is Erin Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| Ms. Sweeney, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11843)|
| 3:17:28| Hi, yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11848)|
| 3:17:29| I just wanted to say a couple of words about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11849)|
| 3:17:34| Yeah, I support this, but I think-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| You could just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| I know you've already spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| but it helps us just to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11859)|
| 3:17:42| Erin Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11862)|
| 3:17:43| I live at 114 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11863)|
| 3:17:48| Yeah, just to reiterate what Tyler was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| is there's very few actual material resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11871)|
| 3:17:59| that these people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| I don't know if you all have spent a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| down at the camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11884)|
| 3:18:05| but they're very grateful for anything that they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| And they don't like the shelters for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11889)|
| 3:18:12| And I think that this should all be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11892)|
| 3:18:15| so that we can provide them more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| I mean, the solution to housing issues is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11897)|
| 3:18:20| I'm not really sure why that's so difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| but anyway, please stop the sweeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11904)|
| 3:18:25| I yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| Thank you, Ms. Sweeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| That's all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11909)|
| 3:18:30| That's three, and that is council's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| There's one more person signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11912)|
| 3:18:35| Do you all wish to allow this fourth person to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| I'm not seeing any responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11922)|
| 3:18:43| I'll make a motion that we-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11925)|
| 3:18:46| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| Is there any opposition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11928)|
| 3:18:50| Okay, we'll let the, by acclamation, fourth speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| Mr. Adam Hughes, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| Okay, Mr. Hughes, if you start with his name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11939)|
| 3:19:02| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11942)|
| 3:19:03| Sure thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11943)|
| 3:19:04| Adam Hughes, 1119 Alexander Street, Apartment B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| I'll try to make this worth your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11947)|
| 3:19:10| I'm speaking in support of item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11950)|
| 3:19:13| I'm encouraging you to accept the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| of the zoning code to allow for social service centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| in general commercial, regional commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| and downtown Knoxville Edge districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| This is a positive step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| to treating homelessness like a public health issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| and treating our homeless neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| as people who need support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| much like many of us often do, though it may look different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11972)|
| 3:19:36| I encourage the city to do whatever possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| to expand access to social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11978)|
| 3:19:42| This is the time to radically expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| the services we can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| On March 15th, the session courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| that oversee evictions will reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| They've been closed since late December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| And at the end of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11992)|
| 3:19:53| the CDC eviction moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| that's kept people in their homes will expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| This will trigger a veritable flood of evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| According to the Tennessee Housing Development Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12002)|
| 3:20:05| it could be upwards of 250,000 throughout our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12005)|
| 3:20:09| Without any hyperbole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| this could be the greatest housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| our city has seen in decades, if not ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| While I dearly hope that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| can find alternate arrangements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| the sad truth is that many people will also become homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12021)|
| 3:20:25| and many for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| I really appreciate the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12027)|
| 3:20:28| and the work you've done to make sure additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12028)|
| 3:20:31| is gonna be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12031)|
| 3:20:32| And I hope many can stay in their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| but I also know that many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| are gonna fall through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| With members of SOCUM and allied groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12038)|
| 3:20:40| I've been observing housing court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12040)|
| 3:20:42| and trying to meet and support people facing evictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| since early summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12044)|
| 3:20:46| The dockets for housing court are massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| There's sometimes hundreds of cases every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12049)|
| 3:20:52| So many people I've met have been unaware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| of both the applicability of the eviction moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| and of the existence of city funds until we spoke to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12058)|
| 3:21:01| and let them know what would make them eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| I've seen judges scold tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| for presenting declarations at the last minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12066)|
| 3:21:08| when the tenants themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| weren't aware of the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12070)|
| 3:21:11| until literally minutes before their hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| And the vast majority of tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| don't even show up for their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12076)|
| 3:21:19| They receive a default judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12079)|
| 3:21:20| they likely already consider themselves evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12080)|
| 3:21:24| While some landlords work with tenants through mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| to keep them in their houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| many won't and in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| often try to tack on minor damage or other complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12089)|
| 3:21:33| to proceed with the eviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| even when it seems the tenant may get funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| if they consider that tenant a long-term risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12097)|
| 3:21:40| So the crisis of homelessness will only become more acute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| in the coming weeks as the courts reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12103)|
| 3:21:47| So I really encourage the city to go beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| what's listed in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| We really know how hard it is for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| to get back into stable housing once they lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| And we know how important a housing first model is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12116)|
| 3:21:59| to help people deal with the compounding problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12119)|
| 3:22:02| that homelessness causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| This ordinance limits new service centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12124)|
| 3:22:07| from offering living quarters in these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| And I'd really encourage council to come up with ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| that housing options can be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| in every single part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| I'd also direct attention to the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12136)|
| 3:22:18| that SACIM signed on with the ACLU of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| and many local groups requesting an end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| to the clearance of encampments during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| I've attended many of these sweeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| to help people move their possessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| and learned a lot about why the current services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| the city provides are insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12153)|
| 3:22:37| People cannot bring all their possessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12157)|
| 3:22:38| and secure their safety in these shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| And many people feel unwelcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| under current shelter policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| I can also confirm that these sweeps are highly disruptive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| even traumatic to the residents of these camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| and that they frequently lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| what few important possessions they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12173)|
| 3:22:56| I understand some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12176)|
| 3:22:57| that the city sees in these camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| but that's all the more reason to continue this pivot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12179)|
| 3:23:02| to expanding social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12182)|
| 3:23:04| Remember, problems never disappear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12184)|
| 3:23:07| just by being displaced or pushed out of sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| and out of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12189)|
| 3:23:10| These encampments become de facto communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12190)|
| 3:23:13| possibly the only communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| that some of our neighbors in Knoxville feel accepted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| And this ordinance is a promising step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| toward supporting our neighbors in these communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12201)|
| 3:23:24| not compounding their problems in times of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12204)|
| 3:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| Thank you, Mr. Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| That concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| People have signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| Council members, do you have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12215)|
| 3:23:40| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| I am in support of this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12223)|
| 3:23:46| but I agree with the speakers that we need to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12226)|
| 3:23:49| Many cities have removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12229)|
| 3:23:58| a special use requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| for social service centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12243)|
| 3:24:06| And instead, trying to remove barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| so more grassroots groups can begin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| they're already providing these services, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12254)|
| 3:24:18| We have grassroots groups working throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12258)|
| 3:24:23| in every, probably, I can't say definitively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12263)|
| 3:24:26| but probably in every zone that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| providing social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| And so I think that this is progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12273)|
| 3:24:37| because we're taking a step forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12277)|
| 3:24:38| but we're so far away from what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| And because we don't have the courage to do it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12281)|
| 3:24:46| there are members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| who are providing a vital service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| that's keeping people alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| and they're doing it illegally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12292)|
| 3:24:56| because we are not providing on the books, in our laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12296)|
| 3:25:02| the support that they need to provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| to community members who need it outside of these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| So I think it's a positive step forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| but it's so far away from where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12313)|
| 3:25:18| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| Any other questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12321)|
| 3:25:26| Okay, seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12326)|

| 3:28:36| I pulled the permit as a contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| knocked the house down in the latter part of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12518)|

| 3:29:16| or go to a mental asylum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12556)|

| 3:31:51| That's a hollow, hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12711)|
| 3:31:54| I mean, that's something Donald Trump would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12714)|

| 3:32:03| And it's not give away, give away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| It's not turn your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| It's not roll your eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| It is get out in the street and roll your hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| There's only one city council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| that's accepted my offer to come walk the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12734)|
| 3:32:17| and walk the camp that's same as same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12737)|
| 3:32:20| Now, I extend my invitation to the rest of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| come out and let's walk down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| Let's talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12745)|
| 3:32:26| Let's meet, let's get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12746)|
| 3:32:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12748)|
| 3:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12750)|
| 3:32:30| Thank you, Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12750)|
| 3:32:36| Mr. Johnson, the next person signed up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12756)|
| 3:32:41| is Erin Bicknees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| I'm sorry, I was gonna say, I don't believe she's with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12763)|
| 3:32:46| Erin Bicknees is not with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12766)|
| 3:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| Next person after that is Gauri Thamkar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12769)|
| 3:32:54| She is also not with us, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12777)|
| 3:32:58| Next person is William Waring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| He's here, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12782)|
| 3:33:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12783)|
| 3:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12784)|
| 3:33:05| Mr. Waring, if you are on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12788)|
| 3:33:09| Can you hear me, mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12789)|
| 3:33:09| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12791)|
| 3:33:12| Let's start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12792)|
| 3:33:13| All right, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12793)|
| 3:33:14| My name is William Waring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12794)|
| 3:33:16| I live at 5800 Central Avenue Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12796)|
| 3:33:21| Now, as far as this all goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| I've lived in Knoxville for about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12803)|
| 3:33:27| I consider myself a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12807)|
| 3:33:28| This is one of my favorite places I've lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12808)|
| 3:33:30| I'm very, I love this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| which is why I'm so disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12812)|
| 3:33:35| with the way that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| people like Mr. Marlow have been treating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| the homeless people in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| especially with the sweeps around the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12823)|
| 3:33:48| not around the shelters, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12828)|
| 3:33:50| with the sweeps around the camps that have been occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12830)|
| 3:33:53| If this is how we treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12833)|
| 3:33:54| some of our most vulnerable citizens during a crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12834)|
| 3:33:57| then I think that speaks volumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| about the way the city just behaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12839)|
| 3:34:03| These people may not have houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| but Knoxville is their home as much as it is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| Further, all of this is in violation of CDC guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| which, I mean, they're guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| It's not like you're breaking any laws, but it is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12854)|
| 3:34:17| And this has been outlined in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| in an open email you received last month from the ACLU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| But they have stated that if you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12864)|
| 3:34:27| to disperse these camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| you need to be able to provide somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12869)|
| 3:34:30| for these people to go, individual housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| and if it's not available, it's a greater risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| Not only to these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| but to the general public to disperse them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| because it can increase the spread of the coronavirus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12879)|
| 3:34:42| and not to mention that these people are at greater risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12882)|
| 3:34:45| of severe infection, hospitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12885)|
| 3:34:48| and death from this illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| As past December, the White House did rate Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12891)|
| 3:34:54| and the surrounding area as the worst place in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12894)|
| 3:34:56| for coronavirus transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12896)|
| 3:34:58| Now, as American Canon did mention earlier this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12898)|
| 3:35:00| we have seen improvement in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12900)|
| 3:35:02| and I'm not saying that no one's happier than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12902)|
| 3:35:04| but while this is great news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12904)|
| 3:35:06| if we're going to continue rating these encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| and dispersing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| I feel like that's antithetical to our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| of trying to keep COVID infection rates down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12912)|
| 3:35:16| As far as short-term solutions go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12916)|
| 3:35:18| and potentially more long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12918)|
| 3:35:20| as was also outlined in the email you received last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12920)|
| 3:35:23| February 16th, I believe it was dated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12923)|
| 3:35:26| FEMA's providing 100% reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12926)|
| 3:35:28| for communities that do provide individual housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12928)|
| 3:35:31| to houseless individuals and families during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12931)|
| 3:35:35| Those resources are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12935)|
| 3:35:36| and they would be a huge step forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12936)|
| 3:35:39| for all of our houseless neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12939)|
| 3:35:40| and for the city's long-term goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12940)|
| 3:35:41| of finding some systemic solutions to homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12941)|
| 3:35:45| I also would like to say that I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12945)|
| 3:35:48| I would like to echo what Tyler, Adam, and Erin said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| I am very much in support of resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12951)|
| 3:35:55| item 12B that you just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| I thank you for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12958)|
| 3:35:59| and I do think you need to go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| but I do think that is an excellent step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| In short, I don't want to take too much more of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12966)|
| 3:36:09| Please stop the sweeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12969)|
| 3:36:10| Please use the resources you were trying to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12970)|
| 3:36:12| on this sort of thing to start taking steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12972)|
| 3:36:14| towards more constructive solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12974)|
| 3:36:16| that put the needs, human rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12976)|
| 3:36:17| and the dignity of our neighbors first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12979)|
| 3:36:20| I yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12980)|
| 3:36:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12982)|
| 3:36:23| Mr. Wang, final person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| is Carolyn Roecliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| Ms. Roecliff, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| Mayor, Ms. Bicknes is logged into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12991)|
| 3:36:34| If you want to go back to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12994)|
| 3:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| Ms. Bicknes, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| Yes, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13002)|
| 3:36:43| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13003)|
| 3:36:44| If you could start by stating your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13004)|
| 3:36:46| for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13006)|
| 3:36:49| Yes, this is Erin Bicknes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| and I live at 2121 Price Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13011)|
| 3:36:55| Thank you all for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13015)|
| 3:36:58| I'll try not to repeat everything you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13018)|
| 3:36:59| but I'm also one more person calling with my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13019)|
| 3:37:03| about the houseless people and the sweeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| that have been happening in the camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| It's just incredibly concerning to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| that our approach to this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| is to try to make them go away, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13032)|
| 3:37:17| The idea that destroying their possessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13037)|
| 3:37:21| bulldozing their temporary homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| would also just make the problem go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13044)|
| 3:37:26| It clearly won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13046)|
| 3:37:29| It's just pushing people out to the margins further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| into less and less safe conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13051)|
| 3:37:34| I know we opened this meeting tonight with a prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| and I heard that prayer include blessings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| for our houseless neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13059)|
| 3:37:42| It's a little bit offensive to me, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13062)|
| 3:37:43| that we would just offer prayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13063)|
| 3:37:45| without fully putting our actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13065)|
| 3:37:48| right alongside those prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| The CDC, as you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13070)|
| 3:37:51| has very clear guidelines for communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13071)|
| 3:37:54| and how we can safely support houseless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| during this time of global pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| The guidelines state that temporary shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| should be left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| They're very clear about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13082)|
| 3:38:04| unless people have places to safely self-isolate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| and stay home when they're sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13088)|
| 3:38:10| just like the rest of us need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13090)|
| 3:38:12| We know that the most dangerous and deadly places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13092)|
| 3:38:14| during COVID are congregate housing situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| like nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13097)|
| 3:38:17| and of course that includes homeless shelters as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| That's where 50% of the deaths are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13100)|
| 3:38:23| for 1% of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| It seems incredibly unethical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| that we would push more people into a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| that we know causes death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13109)|
| 3:38:33| Right now, we have this great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| that FEMA has made available funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| to reimburse communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| who are providing this kind of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| That is what's recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13121)|
| 3:38:42| and it could really be a great win-win opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13122)|
| 3:38:45| for us to help the struggling hospitality industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13125)|
| 3:38:48| at the same time that we support our houseless neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13128)|
| 3:38:52| I'm just thinking about where our hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| and our values are on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13133)|
| 3:38:56| I personally study and try my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13136)|
| 3:38:58| to follow the teachings of Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13138)|
| 3:39:00| but I don't think there are any faith traditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| that think it's okay to bulldoze people's homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13142)|
| 3:39:04| and trash their possessions, with or without notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13144)|
| 3:39:07| And I know the city is saying that there's been notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| and enough time for people to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13151)|
| 3:39:12| but really not enough solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13152)|
| 3:39:14| about where and how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13154)|
| 3:39:16| These are people's grandmothers, brothers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13156)|
| 3:39:19| sisters, and sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| children, nieces, and nephews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| Houselessness is not a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13163)|
| 3:39:24| It's not the fault of these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13164)|
| 3:39:26| It's the failing of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| And I'd like us to stop punishing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13168)|
| 3:39:30| for the care and support that we've failed to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13170)|
| 3:39:33| So as someone in this city, I would just like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13173)|
| 3:39:36| we have to stop the sweeps and do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| Thank you, Ms. Bickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13181)|
| 3:39:42| Is Gauri Tumkur on, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13182)|
| 3:39:48| Ms. Rowcliffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| She's with us, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| Okay, Ms. Rowcliffe, if you could start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| by stating your name and address as a record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| Okay, my name's Caroline Rowcliffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13197)|
| 3:39:58| I'm at 1216 Raintree Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13198)|
| 3:40:03| First, I'd really like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13203)|
| 3:40:04| all of your undivided attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13204)|
| 3:40:06| I've been watching council members while others have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| and I can't help but notice something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| taking up your attention below or beside your camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13211)|
| 3:40:14| And I know you probably can't see me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13214)|
| 3:40:17| and I know some topics are uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13217)|
| 3:40:18| but I'm asking you to do this simple job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| you're paid to do by taxpayers, by me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13221)|
| 3:40:24| and please give me your undivided attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| So I'm here to raise my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13228)|
| 3:40:29| as a lifelong Knoxvillian of almost 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13229)|
| 3:40:32| This is my home, not just the place, but the people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13232)|
| 3:40:37| And I think a lot of people can reside with that message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13237)|
| 3:40:40| that the people are what make your home your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13240)|
| 3:40:45| And some of those people might not have a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13245)|
| 3:40:48| but they are still people, and they are part of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13248)|
| 3:40:54| And I'm really tired of watching the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13254)|
| 3:41:00| that I have called home for 24 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13260)|
| 3:41:04| destroy other people's homes in constant sweeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| and criminalize them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13267)|
| 3:41:12| and say that they need to go to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13272)|
| 3:41:13| and say that we need law and order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13273)|
| 3:41:17| When that is not the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| the point is we need services and we need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13279)|
| 3:41:26| When people need to use the bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13286)|
| 3:41:28| and they have no other place to go to the bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13288)|
| 3:41:30| except the street, you know we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13290)|
| 3:41:34| And you can't criminalize someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13294)|
| 3:41:36| for needing to use the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13296)|
| 3:41:44| Now you can look at this in a humanitarian perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13304)|
| 3:41:48| and I truly hope you look at it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13308)|
| 3:41:50| because these are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13310)|
| 3:41:52| and they should be treated as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13312)|
| 3:41:53| And the most productive way to help our houseless neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| is get to the root cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13316)|
| 3:41:58| And I know I have seen plenty of Facebook posts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| from council members residing over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13321)|
| 3:42:04| The root cause is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| And it has me deeply disappointed as a humanitarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| and as an avid mutual aid volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13329)|
| 3:42:13| that council members, the people voted for and pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| make social media posts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13336)|
| 3:42:18| talking about getting to the root problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13338)|
| 3:42:20| but do not follow through with any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13340)|
| 3:42:23| Enough performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| These are people we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| and we have a solution literally on our doorstep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| The solution being in a letter from the ACLU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| and the National Homeless Law Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| that was signed by dozens of boots on the ground collectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13354)|
| 3:42:38| that Councilwoman Parker has spoken of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| that have had to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13360)|
| 3:42:41| and do what the city has not done for houseless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13361)|
| 3:42:45| And this letter was sent to you all last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13365)|
| 3:42:50| Now, if you wanna look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13370)|
| 3:42:51| from a cost-effective business perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13371)|
| 3:42:53| like Erin Bickney said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| FEMA is providing 100% reimbursement for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| There is no fiscal constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| There is no need for any budgeting conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| There is no excuse as to why we cannot get into these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13384)|
| 3:43:08| and provide it to houseless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13388)|
| 3:43:10| to get emergency housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13390)|
| 3:43:16| For the past year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13396)|
| 3:43:17| I have been volunteering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13397)|
| 3:43:18| with a local boots on the ground collective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| and we've had to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13401)|
| 3:43:22| and fill in the gaps that the city has left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13402)|
| 3:43:24| And I'm not interested today to speak about the collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13404)|
| 3:43:27| I'm not interested to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| how much money we've raised from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| and put back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| I'm here to tell you about the 100 plus people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13412)|
| 3:43:35| I have talked to personally on the phone while volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13415)|
| 3:43:41| A single mom that has a newborn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13421)|
| 3:43:45| and needed help affording a hotel room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| because her tent was destroyed in a sweep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13427)|
| 3:43:54| And she can't afford a hotel because she can't get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13434)|
| 3:43:59| She can't get a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13439)|
| 3:44:00| because she doesn't have a simple ID that she can pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13440)|
| 3:44:11| And I'm talking about people that have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13451)|
| 3:44:15| they've been sent to us by the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13455)|
| 3:44:19| because 2-1-1 could not figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| how to qualify them for funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13461)|
| 3:44:24| These are the gaps that we need to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13464)|
| 3:44:27| People need emergency housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| and the answer is right on your doorstep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| in a letter that was sent to you one week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13471)|
| 3:44:36| I'm asking you as a Knoxvillian and as a humanitarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13476)|
| 3:44:39| and I know so many council people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13479)|
| 3:44:41| that say that they're humanitarians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| So if you're gonna say it, live by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13484)|
| 3:44:47| and live by this and stop sweeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13487)|
| 3:44:49| because they are traumatic for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13489)|
| 3:44:53| and people are losing the only thing that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13493)|
| 3:44:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13496)|
| 3:44:59| Thank you, Ms. Roecliffe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13499)|
| 3:45:00| Council members, just to correct a few things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13500)|
| 3:45:04| I just wanted to first recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| that you guys all are aware of these challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13506)|
| 3:45:09| and we are having a workshop next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| and I encourage members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| to tune in and listen to the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13513)|
| 3:45:17| we're gonna share next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13517)|
| 3:45:19| and the discussion that you all are gonna have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| Just so you know, we get notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| when shelters are at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| The FOIA has not notified us that they're at capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13527)|
| 3:45:31| and neither have any of the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| There is room at the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13532)|
| 3:45:34| Also, just a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| we are very much aware of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13536)|
| 3:45:38| and the CDC guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13538)|
| 3:45:40| and that's why we as a city and you as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| supported the change where we allowed tent encampment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13542)|
| 3:45:46| under blackstock for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| at the beginning of the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13548)|
| 3:45:50| and gave money to our service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13550)|
| 3:45:53| who serve the homeless to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13553)|
| 3:45:55| and make physical changes and cleaning regimen changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13555)|
| 3:45:58| to make the shelters COVID compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13558)|
| 3:46:01| and safe for people to stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13561)|
| 3:46:02| even though it is congregate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| And they did those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13564)|
| 3:46:06| And as you know, the tent encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13566)|
| 3:46:08| are not humane place for people to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13568)|
| 3:46:11| That's not housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| I support the housing first approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| as I know you all do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13575)|
| 3:46:18| So the answer is more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13578)|
| 3:46:19| and I'm encouraged by some of the actions we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13579)|
| 3:46:22| And I look forward to discussing further solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13582)|
| 3:46:25| next week, including the FEMA thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| which sounds like it'd be just a matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13587)|
| 3:46:30| of going to, you know, getting the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13590)|
| 3:46:33| and going to a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13593)|
| 3:46:34| But as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13594)|
| 3:46:35| it's a little more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| So I look forward to sharing more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| and having a fuller discussion on these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13599)|
| 3:46:41| next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| And that concludes-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13603)|
| 3:46:44| And I would like to see the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13604)|
| 3:46:46| that spoke tonight to join us at our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13606)|
| 3:46:49| I think it would be good for their voices to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13609)|
| 3:46:52| And we'll see, we'll talk to vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13612)|
| 3:46:55| about the plans for that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13615)|
| 3:46:56| That's something that she is organizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13616)|
| 3:47:00| and we can work on that in the weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| and the days to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| Council members, there's no more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13624)|
| 3:47:05| signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13625)|
| 3:47:08| I'm gonna, without any further ado, adjourn this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13628)|
| 3:47:11| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210309?start=13631)|
