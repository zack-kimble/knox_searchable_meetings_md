| 0:05:03| and until recently we haven't had any violations. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| met with our employees gone over the procedures of how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| are supposed to look at an ID information they're supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| get off of it. And in addition to that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| purchased a. I.D. scanner and I.D. vision Z. twenty two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| counter top scanner. This is a digital scanner that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| read forty eight states license the magnetic strip on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| back of it. And the. Military IDs. We have trained our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| employees to look at the IDs. Check the dates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| visual of the face. And then to scan the card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| the cross check it with. Then pick the number on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| the driver's license. And the picture. Councilman Becker. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=348)|
| 0:05:56| on Mr. Smith we have a a law. It says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| you have to see an I.D. from everybody you sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| beer to you you're familiar with that law yes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| are. Now I can see you've got two offenses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| one of those you didn't ask even as a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| for their I.D. right now. While the systems you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| are really good they all require somebody to take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| step and get the I.D. and the cards are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| I'm always worried I will eventually make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| send you to administrative hearing I was do that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| when people have not been checking your I.D.'s. Because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| doesn't it doesn't work if you don't check the I.D.'s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| We have we also have a security system we've told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| our employees that we will be regularly going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| video and anyone selling beer without scanning the I.D. will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| be terminated immediately. Customer with. In the I.D. scanner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=404)|
| 0:06:53| a new element of your system. Yes it is after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| the two underage sales. Yes the second violation we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| an employee that just calculated wrong in their head. Did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| the age and we bought that to try to layer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| technology on top to try to cover inaccuracies and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| human error. What did you do after the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| After the first we met with everybody had them come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| to two or three meetings and showed them how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| read an I.D. Thanks. Customer people. My question was how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=441)|
| 0:07:32| were the employees who were responsible for the citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| How were they dealt with. Are they still employed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| you. Well the first one was suspended for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| The second one was actually one of the owners she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| an elderly lady. I'm sorry. And and so. You can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=465)|
| 0:07:56| fire the owner. I'm sorry I did I didn't understand you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| one of the owners. Right. That's my fault. He just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=480)|
| 0:08:11| answered my question. OK. Is she still. She doesn't run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| the cash register anymore. Just mentally. Councilman Bailey. Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| I think we heard at one point that sometimes rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| to terminate the employee it's sometimes better to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| around because they've learned their lesson and so forth. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| that's just a little something I remember. I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| things you've done since this since the last incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| councilman Woodhull asked you about the timing of the I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| scanner and we purchased it within a week after the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| violation. Right. When did you implement these other processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=531)|
| 0:09:02| Besides buying the scanner. After the first violation we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| a meeting within seven days and we had two meetings after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| that and we have had no new employees since then and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| remind them we have signs everywhere and we have told told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| our employees that if you do not card everybody that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| in scan their I.D. cross check the scan with the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| I.D. If we catch them on videotape not doing that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| time they are terminated. And so you have videotape as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| Yes we do. When how long have you had that. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| had that for about 10 years. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Councilman Becker. I'll go ahead and make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| send to a suspension revocation hearing. Did we get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=584)|
| 0:09:56| second. Although any discussion. Councilman Roddy. Yes. Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=596)|
| 0:10:05| Mayor Becker explain to me more about your rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| sending this this business I know one of the things we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| look for is a beer board is a very proactive stance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| addressing the issue and purchasing this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| technology is something that we have asked businesses to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| in the past. So it would appear if all the employees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| using this with regularity that they have have taken a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| strong stand to address this problem. Is it the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| frequency of the violations or what. Tell me your thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| process. Well I think when a business is not even getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| an I.D. that's a sign to me that there's a problem. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| clearly that their first violation they didn't ask for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| I.D. And that wonderful piece of technology doesn't work if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| you don't ask for an I.D. So I also I sort of I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| always do that and I do trust the wisdom of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| council to make the right decision. This is this is I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| be honest this is not one that I'm going to lose any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| sleep over if this gets voted down. So I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| are making some steps. But it feels to me like when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| we have businesses that can't on a routine basis ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| an I.D. we have a problem. Right. But my history says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| on the second violation they did ask for I.D. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| correct. OK. So that that showed up. I'm sorry. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| that was after they got the scanner. That correct. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| that was the second violation was before we got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| scanner. She did ask for the I.D. She misread it. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| then my understanding from your remedial plan is that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| for some reason the scanner is inoperable then two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| have to look at the exactly. Have you had a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| like that. It has not gone down yet. And you just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| one cash register. So you just need one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| machines. It's not tied to the cash register. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| two cash registers and one machine. OK. And everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| knows how to use it. Everybody's been fully trained in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| how to use it. It's pretty simple technology to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| I think that technology could could make a big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| and I'm impressed that the business has been willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| to invest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| That's a pretty low. I would agree with the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| since Councilman Roddy has made. But I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| ask you about the videotape. Apparently you've had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| for a long period of time. But. Obviously maybe we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| not checking it or viewing it frequently. Correct. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| the past we had only reviewed the videotape when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| had had money missing or a crime had been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| So now I'm interested in what your practice is regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| viewing or reviewing the tape. We'll sit down and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| at several shifts a week. Just go through them quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| and when somebody brings beer up watch to see if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| scan and go through the process. Well that seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| me to be very important if you're going to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| really sustain your your rules and your policies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| you've put in place. Because if the employees are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| aware that they are being checked they probably will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| become less concerned about being responsible. I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| you've made some extremely good moves toward complying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| and congratulate you for that and just hope that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| will keep your record clean in the future. We've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| in business 26 years inside a community and to us this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| is a failure on our part. I'm very familiar with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| establishment and I know it's important to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| community. So I wish you well on the practices you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| put in place. Thank you. Councilman Bailey. One last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| question. How long have you had the mandatory mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| dismissal when they don't check? Since we got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| scanner. OK well I appreciate Councilman Roddy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| Pilo's comments and I agree with them and I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| support you and I hope I don't see you back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| OK are we ready to vote? This vote is to send him to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| a suspension revocation hearing. Yes. Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| No. Vice Mayor Becker. Aye. Councilman Booker. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| Councilman Frost. No. Councilman Hall. No. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Hultquist. No. Councilman Pilo. No. Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| No. Councilman Woodhull. No. Well that motion failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| eight to one. Significant margin. Significant margin. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=892)|

| 0:15:32| Lane in Maryville, Tennessee. You're here tonight because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| you've had several underage sales to minors and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| present us with a plan of what you intend on doing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| prevent that from happening in the future. Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Easy Stop Food Marts operates 22 stores of which 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| have beer licenses in East Tennessee. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| training program which Sandy Kirkpatrick administers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| All of our cashiers are trained on alcohol and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| tobacco sales prior to resuming responsibilities in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| the store for the sales before they're ever taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| to take duty. We use Sandy's act as the National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Association of Convenience Stores alcohol and tobacco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=973)|

| 0:16:20| trainer and renews that training every year. All of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| our employees of course go through the city required and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| county required training here in Knox City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| and Knox County. We have a alcohol and tobacco policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| review session with all employees at all stores and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| they're required to sign that. We have records of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| for all the stores for the prior 12 months. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| hire an outside company that does mystery shops at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| various times during the month so they catches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| different shifts at different times. If a cashier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| fails one of our mystery shops he goes back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| this recertification program with new hires. If he or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| she fails the second time they're terminated. If an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| employee is convicted of the offense they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| immediately terminated. State law requires a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| holder not to employ anyone convicted of that. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| first offense at Easy Stop 14, approximately 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| months ago, was a new product that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| contained tomato juice that our cashier had never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| seen before and thought it was a tomato juice product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| didn't realize it was alcohol. It was not in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| price book even. The beer wholesaler had stocked it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| prior to us prior to us even having it in the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| book and she inadvertently thought it was a tomato| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| juice product and sold it. She was not convicted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| that citation. Second citation the clerk overrode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| the prompt from the computer system which required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| her to put the ID in and made the sale after three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| attempts. So we have gone through with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| cashiers at that store as well as the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| required that new training. We also have a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| software system that we're installing and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| as you can imagine going all the way from retail to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| accounting that will alert us to error corrects and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| no date entries on alcohol and tobacco sales. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| can see if a cashier actually look at the cashier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| performance and revisit with them if they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| making sales from the prior day's reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| Councilman Roddick. Mr. Hunt I understand that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| the new system that you're implementing from retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| through accounting is is recent. How many of the of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| the other controls that you discussed have they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| been after your second violation. These are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| ongoing things we've been doing for five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| years. So asking the employees to sign the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| confirmation of your policy monthly and the mystery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| shoppers all that has been on at least five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| years. I have copies for this store for the prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| 12 months of all of those. So the only change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| you have made after the second violation was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| purchasing of this new software. That software is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| ongoing but it gives us some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| capabilities for control of permitted products. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| you've had that software but you haven't used the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| control aspect of it. Software is just newly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| installed in the stores. OK. And so you plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| analyze the data results. It gives us it allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| to actually pull the information from the cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| register to a database and then scan the database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| by cashier by day and by product and let us have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| that information. And I understand that that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| be helpful to you as an employer to ascertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| employee compliance. However it doesn't seem to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| to address in any other kind of proactive way beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| sales and tobacco sales as you mentioned. But our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| concern is beer sales at the register. Our existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| software required an age verification. The cashier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| overrode that age verification after the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| request on this last sale. So on your first sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| there was no check of ID at all. No it was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| unknown UPC because the beer the beer wholesaler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| put the product. Right. She didn't know the tomato| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| juice product. So there was no check of ID. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| second time there was check of ID. But she overrode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| the system. Overrode the system. So you have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| started any new policies, any new training with your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| employees, anything else. Other than if it's if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| don't override the system. Thank you. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| Woodhull. When when when you said in the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| instance that she overrode the system. What do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| what exactly are you saying that she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| disregarding what it was asking for ID and she put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| the ID in and told her it was not legal but she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| thought she put it in incorrectly and made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| sale. She thought she had put it in incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| OK. Now my impression is that you think that your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| system is is just fine the way it is. Is that true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| We're not perfect. But the we have passed 15 beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| stings from other municipalities in the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| and a half. We have passed them with three other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| stores in the city of Knoxville. Just passed one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| in Alcoa last week with three stores. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Becker. Yeah. Two things. Just following up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Councilman Woodhull's question. Tell me about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| system for your cash register beer scans. Cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| register says give me an ID. Give me an ID. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| is you type a date in. Correct. And this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| typed it in three times and then thought all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| times she had typed it wrong. Yes. All right. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| right. And what do you do in the future to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| that. Training issues as far as following up if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| know if you're uncertain of the age don't make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| sale. We've always told our cashiers that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| wanted to refuse a sale for alcohol that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| stand behind them if they thought a person was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| inebriated if they were uncertain as to the ID. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| you've worked in the field with retail our cashiers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| have been assaulted slapped and call all sorts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| things for asking for IDs. That's one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| why our company worked with the cities of Alcoa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Maryville and Blount County to enact the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| after Oak Ridge initially did that where we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| that Big Brother wants the ID not me thinking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| you're you know under 30 or whatever. We find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| that's helped a lot in the community acceptance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| having the ID presented. But we have always told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| them if you've got a question about it do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| make the sale because you ultimately are the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| that could serve a jail sentence as well as us as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| well. I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| send to a suspension revocation. Again I do trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| the wisdom of the council to make the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| decision on it. But it ought to be on our plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| So I'm making that motion. I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Councilman Frost. Thank you. See a little difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| between this one and the previous one. First the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| first triggering offense was in January of last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| year. And then the second one was 14 months and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| days afterwards. And the first one was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| dismissed. You know you can. They do have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| procedures in place. But if people are bound and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| determined to think that they're doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| wrong and they're going to go ahead and make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| sale. I mean technology is going to be pretty hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| hard thing to catch. Even if the sale to the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| in January of 08 had not been dismissed. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| a pretty long gap. I mean it's within the window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| where you can send somebody to a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| revocation hearing. But I'm not sure I can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| supportive of it in this case. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Councilman Bailey. Yeah Chairman. I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Councilman Frost on his remarks. But I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| you what is the status of the employee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| overrode the system. She's terminated. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| terminated. And I agree. I don't know how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| you deal with an employee that wants to override| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| technology like that. And the the beer tomato juice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| incident I guess is the one that was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Yes sir. And then 14 months since then. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| tend to agree with Councilman Frost. The name of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| that product was what was it? Clamata. And it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| a it didn't look like a bud product. It looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| like a tomato juice blend. And it was a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| product that the wholesaler was not supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| put into the next week so that we could go around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| and make education that this is something you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| going to be checking for ID and get it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| price book. Well here again I'm going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| you and I hope I don't see you back. But I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| want to say that anything you keep you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| keep trying to find new innovative ways to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| prevent this. That's why we're spending three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| hundred fifty thousand dollars on this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| software. Thank you. Councilman Hocus. Yeah I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| tend to find myself in agreement with Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Frost and Councilman Bailey. One of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| that we look for is the frequency and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| repetition of these. How far apart the violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| are. And as was pointed out these are pretty far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| apart. But the fact that the first offense was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| dismissed and that I take Mr. Hunt at his word I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| believe him to be an honest man. And the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| that it was just a freak situation where you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| they had a new product that wasn't even supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| to be on their shelves or in their coolers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| And no one knew how to deal with at least not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| people on the front line retail wise. And so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| tend to be fairly strict on these things but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| not going to vote to send it on. Councilman Hocus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| that you may be careful about my honesty because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| I'm a city councilman at Maryville as well. Well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| do note that but I'm going to give you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| benefit of the doubt. How do you feel about guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| in parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Councilman Pelo. Well of course the fact that he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| a city councilman and I guess we all noted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| would indicate that we think your integrity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| honesty is as pure as the driven snow because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| ours is. But no I was a bit concerned initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| just feeling that your comments were fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| blase regarding the matter. And you can see we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| don't take it casually at all. And we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| because we have a tremendous responsibility. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| ma'am. But I have to agree that with the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| time frame and just the peculiar nature of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| first offense. So your honesty is critically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| important based on the fact that you know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| going to go along with that. I was curious though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| to ask you the the firing if you will of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| employee. When did that come? Immediately or was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| there some time? Yes same day. Same day. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| We've got a motion and a second to send them to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| suspension revocation hearing. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| further discussion on that? Ms. Mitchell will you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| call the roll? Vice Mayor Becker? Aye. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Booker? No. Councilman Frost? No. Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| No. Councilman Hultquist? No. Councilman Pelo? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| Councilman Roddy? No. Councilman Woodhull? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Councilman Bailey? No. That motion fails eight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| one. You're on a roll Vice Mayor. Thank you sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| Magnolia Minimart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| My theory is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1694)|
| 0:28:23| I'm sorry but could you speak up just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| Magnolia Minimart 2400 is Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| Councilman Becker? I'm going to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| postpone this for our next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Apparently KPD has some other issues with this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| that we should probably be aware of and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| there's some legal reasons to not consider this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| So I'm going to make a motion to postpone and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| how that flies. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Councilman Frost? Thank you. I was going to substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| motion to the next beer board meeting where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| regularly scheduled beer board meeting where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| administrative hearings. That's I will accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| That's very wise. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Councilman Hultquist? Do you need to elaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| anymore? It hasn't done me any good so far tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| We have Officer Husky here. I was just going to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Officer Husky if you wanted to comment for our benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Yes ma'am. Just as early as today we've come across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| some additional violations and we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| investigating. We will be asking for a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| through the law department in front of a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| officer in the very near future. So we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| that we hear all the violations at that time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| we'll be serving them in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you. Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Mr. Swanson, is what we've heard relevant to what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| before us? It's not relevant to what's before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| but it makes sense if they're going to go to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| suspension or revocation hearing anyway based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| additional charges that have occurred since this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| last event that you not take the time with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| administrative hearing here but postpone it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| allow the law department to file those charges. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| they don't then it should come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Okay any further discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Opposed no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Do you understand? Thank you sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| Smoky's Sports Pub and Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1837)|
| 0:30:53| Good evening. Michelle Mapstone, Smoky's Sports Pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| and Bar, 2613 West Adair, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| You're here tonight because you've had 200 sales to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| minors and to present us with a plan of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| intend to do to prevent that from happening in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Well, I've had a policy in place since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| It's rather simple. If in doubt, throw them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| This means if they walk through the door and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| look unsavory, intoxicated, or suspicious in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| manner, do not allow them in the pub or serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| This means do not check their ID, just ask them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| leave. As we have a policy in the pub that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| that we have a right free service to anyone, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| reason required. All individuals, regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| age, are to be carded. A current valid ID is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| required. Not only are you to check the date, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| year of birth, you are to check the month and date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| If it is someone's 21st birthday, you do have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| right to tell him or her to come back tomorrow as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| we do not know the time of their birth. One of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| these days, the state of Tennessee will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| be asking the question since I wonder about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| myself. There will be no grace. Anyone serving an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| individual under 21 will be terminated. This issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| should never have to be addressed because the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| number one will not allow for this situation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| occur. Individuals coming into the pub wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| sell items to customers, this is not related, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| not relevant. It was on meat days and stuff like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| that. Additionally, we normally have signs that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| posted 21 and up, no exceptions. The window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| cleaners have a tendency to take them down and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| keep putting them up. I have a new one that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| thank you management and the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| There is no one that enters that pub that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| not be carded. The incident on July 2nd with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| Gidget Lamar, she has been terminated and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| know how to phrase this. I guess she wasn't the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| brightest light bulb in the world. The person's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| birth date was either 10-28 or 10-23 and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| license was 2009 and when she looked at it, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| she neglected to look at the date of birth and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| month of birth. The young man was 20 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| instead of 21. I have not had that much turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| in the pub. There are three individuals that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| been there for quite a while. I have a new person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| in staff who is very good at what she does. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2011)|
| 0:33:43| like me, she checks the ID and the thing about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| is if in doubt, you throw them out. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| make any difference. If I look at you and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| whatever reason, I don't feel like it's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| you've got to go. That's all there is to it. Like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| someone said earlier, you sure can get cussed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| not serving someone a beer. What transpired should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| have never happened but it did and I love my pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| I don't want us to tell this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Councilman Becker, tell me, do you ID people at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| the door? No, we ID people when they enter the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| When they come in, they have entered the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| they come into the pub, they step up to the bar and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| that is when they are ID'd or if you look up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| it looks like someone is too young, you just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| them to leave, period, before they walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| So, you are asked to ID when you enter, so everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| who comes in is going to be asked for an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Yes, regardless of age. It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And how long has that been the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Since 2003. I've had the pub a little over six and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| And you got two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| Yes, I did. It was the first day of summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I got busted that day and they didn't last very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| What's different between what you were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| before? The first one was on April 21st of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| What's different from April 20th of 2008 before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| that first violation and now? What are you doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Well, the first one was on April 21st of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| Oh, Lord. I have looked at some systems like other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| people and right now I'm trying to decide which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| one is the best way to go and not put the pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| out of business. Purchasing technology and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| putting the pub out of business by someone not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| knowing how to subtract or add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| The only thing I can tell you is that I've met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| with my employees and told them, guys, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| We have to be very cognizant in what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| We have to make sure that we can add and subtract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| We have to make sure that someone is 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I am in the process of looking at technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| and it is very pricey and I understand that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| have to spend money to make money and to stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| business. But same token, sometimes these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| are so huge that if you do it, you put yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| in harm's way in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| Um, all I can say is that I am looking at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| options, but right now, I'm on their feathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| all the time. Guys, check their ID, make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| they're doing, you know, just keep doing what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And it just takes one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| Adam's in already for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| It just takes one moment of memory lapse for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| wrong thing to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And both times, this is transfer, which is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| good. It's been with the with the city. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| because I get IDs all the time where they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| expired in 2006 or whatever, and I refuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| service to those individuals because state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| requires that has the current valid ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2243)|
| 0:37:32| Ma'am. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| I'm just a little bit confused and I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| that you are concerned about your pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2260)|
| 0:37:40| And I know you don't want to have to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| separation, but I'm a little bit concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| that everyone really understands your policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| because I really don't. Now, at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| someone is watching at the door and they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| ID and people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| That's what I understood you to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| And then a moment later, you stated that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| ID them at the bar. But in between, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| stated that they are asked to leave before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| get to the bar if they don't look. Is it? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I'm not sure if I were one of your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| that I would understand where my responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| OK, the responsibility. I'm sorry if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Use anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Say street people who will come to the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| door and open the door to see who's in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| and they will ask people for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| I understand the question. So as soon as that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| person walks in the door, we already know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| that is someone we do not want in the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| I do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| So we ask them to leave before they ever ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| for a beer or anything else. They're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| I mean, that's the end of the story. You're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| gone. It doesn't make any difference. Or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| you bring in what looks like stolen merchandise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| they're gone. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| That's it. And if someone walks in and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| look like they're 16 years old, I don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| how old you just need to go. But if you walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| into the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Up to the bar or if you're sitting at a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Each person that works their cards, each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| who is sitting and ordering. If there is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| person that walks into that pub that is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| age, they are all asked to leave. If they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| if there is one person who has an ID that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| not current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| They have the options of leaving as a group or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| that one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Is not served. Understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I'm just don't believe I do understand your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| hesitancy to employ some technology to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| your your employee. There is no actual hesitancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| in that. It's just I am looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| At probably not what you guys would consider a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| whole lot of money, but it is a lot of money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| the pub. And I have looked at several systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| that we could purchase as well as a new cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| as well as a new cash register that has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| capability of swiping. Well, I'll just make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| ID. I'll just make one observation. Okay. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| believe that the second sale to a minor was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| July. Yes, it was. We are just about to end the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| year. So that is just about five and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| months ago. And it concerns me that decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| haven't been made and something has not occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| that is going to change the way in which you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| able to operate the pub. So you can keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| going. That's just my personal. Okay. Well, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| thing I was not aware of when this happened in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| July, I called and asked what the ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| were. And either I'm sadly mistaken or grossly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| misunderstood. I was not aware that I was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| to be fined, nor would I have to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| something else. So when I got the letter that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| hand-delivered on the 2nd of December saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| this was my second offense and that I needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| write you guys a check for $500 and send you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| letter, I sent the check that day and wrote this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| letter. And that is why nothing else has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| because I wasn't aware that I needed to put a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| plan in action. Because otherwise I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| already done something because I really hate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| stand here feeling like two cents waiting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| Councilman Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| Ms. Mapstan, I'm looking at the letter that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| sent to you that you received on the 2nd of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| December. And it does indicate in the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| paragraph here that the permit holder is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| by ordinance to file with the city a revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| remedial plan designed to prevent future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| violations. And we have in front of us both your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| letter of December 2nd of this year and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| letter of April 2008. And after the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| violation, you are to submit a plan as to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| you're going to address that. And then as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| letter said, in November of this year, after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| second violation, you are to submit a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| indicating your revised plan. In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| whatever plan A was didn't work, so what's plan B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| And I understand how much you care for your pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| and your patrons that visit you there. But this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| afternoon, in reviewing these documents, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| couldn't find anything that changed in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| policy between your plan A and your plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| And we have store owners, business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| restaurant owners who come in front of us who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| not utilizing technology, but they have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| with policies for their employees which tighten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| up the ship a little bit in some respect. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| it's a buddy check system where more than one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| person checks an ID. Maybe it's the use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| flashlights, you know, in a darker restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| Maybe it's a monthly employee meeting where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| everyone's pulled together and the rules are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| reviewed one more time. Maybe the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| voluntarily goes through the task certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| again. There's some elevation of effort noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| after the second violation. And my concern here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| is that I don't see in your second letter, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| second remedial plan, or in your remarks tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| anything that has changed in your ongoing plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| that you've had since 2003. Well, what I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| realize is that I should have said that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| have meetings. And the guys, they will double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| check. I did not realize that that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| that I should have stated. And I will have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| admit, when I read this letter, I was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| like in outer space and I did miss the remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| line. Well, obviously, that remedial plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| very important to us in ascertaining our sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| of comfort level with the safety of patrons in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| any establishment, and particularly underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| patrons. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you. Ms. Mapstone, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| If you were given some, I've heard clearly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| you misunderstood or just something didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| connect. If you were given additional time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| come up with a remedial plan, do you think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| could do so? Yes, I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Okay. Well, based on that, I'll ask to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| this to the next regularly scheduled beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| meeting where there are administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| Councilman Boehler, you have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| You know, I'm just over here listening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| sometimes we get a very professional presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| and sometimes we don't. And, you know, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| you hear some emotion and some, the tone of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| voice of the owner and you get a sense of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| they are on it. And, you know, we, Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Husky, we talked about this preventative measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| list, which I know you provided us, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| think is very good. And I had a question. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| did the owners or potential owners receive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| preventative measures list? And because what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| I'm talking about is Councilman Roddy just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| talked about the buddy check. You know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| wonder about the lighting. We've heard certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| owners come in and talk about the lighting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| bad and so forth. But there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| inexpensive things, proactive things that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| can do. And I just wanted to know, when do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| provide that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| I was going to say, I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Unless the Metropolitan Drug Commission, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| might have something to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I'm just wondering if at the task force, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| know, you know, the task certification meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| or, you know, at some point in time, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| some of these owners, if they had the foresight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| they would, you know, come and present us with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| And they are taught in the alcohol class to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| flashlights, take the ID, physically hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| But as far as us presenting them the list I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| gave you, that is something that we worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Metropolitan Drug Commission and just come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| with for you all to give them bits and pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| But they do learn that in the alcohol class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| All right. Well, I seconded Councilman Frost's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2813)|
| 0:46:53| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Councilman Prelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Well, I hate to take a hard line on this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| very honestly, I feel after that first letter in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| 2008, I would have been asking a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| questions if I had been in your shoes and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| been as concerned about my business as I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| And it's, you know, sometimes I think it's we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| have to learn hard lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| And very frankly, I don't feel comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| a postponement of this for a month because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| frankly, I just see, I don't see someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| really understands the seriousness of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| were faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| And I, this is, in eight years, this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| first time that I have ever seen someone who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| appeared just not to be particularly concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| I'm terribly sorry, but I'm about to fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2877)|
| 0:47:57| My heart is about to jump out of my chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Well, I'm sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| And you're in a very difficult position, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| we are too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| And I want to be sure that everyone who comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| into your establishment is safe, is treated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| the same manner that they would be in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| So I simply, I'm not going to go along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| the motion to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| But I would like to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| When the first offense occurred last year, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| went back to working 120 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| So I did not have to worry about someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| screwing up because I care about that pub more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| I didn't realize you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2913)|
| 0:48:33| That's my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| I care about that pub more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| And I'm sorry that you feel that I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| negligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| No, I think this is going to be a very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| defining moment in the life of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| And unfortunately, we're put in a position of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| having to perhaps make a decision that is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| to require you to do some work in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| direction where you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| And I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Councilor Morales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| One of the things that the Spear Board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| talked about extensively on numerous occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| is trying to be consistent with various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| businesses that we have addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| And as we all know, there's always some kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| of extenuating circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| It is a subjective decision, but we have tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| very hard to be consistent in our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| And I guess from where I sit, I feel like it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| not consistent or fair to some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| businesses that we have heard, not tonight, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| on other nights who have presented remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| plans that we have felt were deficient and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| were not allowed a chance to go back for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| do-over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| The letters that are sent out from over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Chairman Hall's signature are very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| There's two letters after the first offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| and after the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| And I don't recall us ever giving an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| establishment a chance for a do-over on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Certainly that chance occurs at the suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| But I do think it's incumbent upon us to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Councilman Moorehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| I actually agree with everything that you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| said, Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Officer Husky, when somebody is required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| prepare a remedial plan, can they come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| and ask for suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| They certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| I mean, you said a lot of the ideas that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| have gone into this one were taught in the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Occasionally I'll get a call when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| preparing the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3044)|
| 0:50:44| And then do you give advice about whether that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| remedial plan would be accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Well, they talk like flashlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And we bring up ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Sometimes they don't think of what they do to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| put in that plan to let you know that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| already doing those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| But I get very few calls on it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| But you'd be open to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I never occurred to me the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| would assist me in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| I am terribly sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Can you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| The motion is to defer to the next regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| scheduled beer board meeting that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3093)|

| 0:51:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| We'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3099)|

| 0:51:54| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3116)|

| 0:51:58| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| So it's tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Now what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| But you guys, I think I need to sit down and pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I'll make a motion to send to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3163)|

| 0:52:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3178)|

| 0:53:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3188)|
| 0:53:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| Ma'am, they'll be notifying you of where to appear for a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I'm terribly sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| What did you just say to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| They will be notifying you of a suspension revocation hearing for you to come to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3211)|
| 0:53:41| Chairman Hall, could you address what happens at those hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Typically, the suspension revocation is not permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| And really, it's up to an administrative judge, I guess is what they call them, to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3230)|
| 0:53:58| decision to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| It'll be something like this, except more formal, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| I work, apparently, I need to work on a real remedial plan and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3252)|
| 0:54:24| new form of technology in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| And what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| You'll be contacted from the law department, from the city council, from the beer board office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3275)|
| 0:54:45| which is the city council office, with the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| When is your next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| Oh, it's not the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| They'll notify you as to when to come and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| It won't be here, in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Councilman Bailey, do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| This is an item of new business, Chairman Hall, but relative to our last permittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| I'm wondering, would this beer board feel it would be appropriate to ask Officer Husky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| and his compliance department, or maybe Ms. Mitchell and the recorder's office, to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| out that list of suggestions with the letter following the noncompliance, I guess at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| first, to give businesses ideas where to start in terms of putting together their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| Would that be considered helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| Yes, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3356)|
| 0:55:56| Sounds like a good idea to me, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Well, maybe in addition to that, it would be important to just indicate to the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| or the business that your assistance is available, if they would like to request it, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| allow them to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| I don't want to request anything that's going to be onerous or burdensome on anybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| office, but I thought at least the list of suggestions might be a place for them to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| After the first sale, we hand deliver, personally, a notice, and that wouldn't be an issue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| put that along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Yeah, I guess I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I sort of have a worry, and I guess this is for Mr. Swanson or Mr. Frost, about a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| If we have given somebody a list of suggestions and then turn around and they do some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| suggestions and we still find them, I mean, is that — and I don't want to — I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| want to, you know, ask the lawyers too much here, because I know lawyers can say no to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| anything, but just — I'd sort of like some thought on how to do that the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| Bob, it just wasn't the lawyers saying no to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| It was eight people that have said no to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| I really don't think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| If you just present them with some list of suggestions of things that can be done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| make their business practices better business practices, that does not in any way imply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| that City Council is going to accept that all by itself as being sufficient to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| going to a suspension or revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| It's just simply an opportunity for them to have additional information that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| source of information for them to utilize in doing a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| But there's certainly no guarantee associated with it that it would be adequate to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| every concern that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| So as long as it doesn't contain such a representation, I think you'd be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3476)|
| 0:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Wait a minute, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| It's my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3485)|
| 0:58:05| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| I was just going to thank you for your role as chairman of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| You've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| You've been steady and a pillar in a very important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3492)|
| 0:58:26| And I would like to thank Officer Husky because he has certainly been very beneficial to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3517)|
