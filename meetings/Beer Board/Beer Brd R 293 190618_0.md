| 0:05:37| Will Cheek Legal Counsel to Main Event. I'm from Nashville, Tennessee. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Mr. John King here also. Mr. A.J. Underwood, our general manager. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| Sergeant Cowher. No record. The file is complete. Chairman, just because my firm's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| involved in this, I'm going to recuse myself on this vote. Okay, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=356)|
| 0:06:05| You're good. And I know the record is complete, but wanted to, you know, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| past we've had some difficulties at this location. I know we've got new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| management now, but just wanted to, I noticed your plan for server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| compliance was very thorough, so I appreciate that. You want to maybe let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| know a little bit about, you know, how you're going to correct some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| things that had been dealt with in the past? Sure. If it would, if I could indulge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| the members of the board, we've got like a five-minute presentation. Will that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| address? Okay, so I'm going to call down Mr. Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=399)|
| 0:06:47| So why don't you explain who recorded? Yeah, so we have really started. Please state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| your name for the record. Sorry, Adam Underwood. Okay. It might be A.J. on y'all's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| paperwork. Okay. And I'm the general manager now there. Took that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| over about eight weeks ago. Okay. And so as far as IDing goes, we've just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| tightened down on our IDing restrictions, and so anyone with a red box ID or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| vertical ID, which is an under 21-year-old ID, or anyone born after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| date 1995, all of those things now require manager approval to even sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| them any type of alcohol whatsoever. And two of the main reason for that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| obviously, you know, that's an under 21 ID. We want to make sure that that's, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| know, that their birth date is over 21. But the second reason for that is making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| sure that we know if a 21, 22, or 23-year-old is drinking in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| establishment, just because we understand that those people might not, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| need to make sure that as managers we have an eye on them and know what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| are doing, just based upon experience of drinking and the likelihood that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| have someone under the age of 21. And so we want to make sure that we're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| proactive in that part of it. We also verbally require every person that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| drinks with us to confirm they were over the age of 21, and we are IDing everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| So I tell the bartenders and servers, if your ma'am all comes in, you ask them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| their ID. So those are a couple of the things we are doing. We have also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| instilled the IntelliCheck system, which some of you may know. I think it's used...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| We'd like to show you. It's kind of neat to see it in operation. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| could come up and demonstrate? Why don't we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| First of all, we're referring to the red box IDs. These are driver's licenses, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| it's got a red box on the picture. This indicates the person used to be under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| We have our rule, like this, also a red box. The secret of this is, if you're a man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| you turn it sideways, it says the date of the person who is 21. So we've re-educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| everybody so they know what they have. But, when you see a red box ID, which we also have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| this is a red box ID, so this person actually turns 21 Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| So a likely scenario for someone to come in and try and get past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| So we have three of these, one that's mobile around the center, and two that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| affixed to the granite, one on our bar above, on our bowling lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| So we have one that can be carried around, two that are affixed for everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| that should be scanned through. You merely hit the scan ID button there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| And you do that, it pulls up this camera, and then you just, boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=562)|
| 0:09:30| And this person, as you can see, is not okay. You get an alert that they cannot be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| So I will say that we don't do this for every single ID, it's only the ones that have a red box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=574)|
| 0:09:44| that look like they have some issue on them, 95 or older, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| And the reason why is we don't want to get them in the habit of scanning IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| we want to get them in the habit of checking. And so we check for those specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| So if you hit the scan ID button again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| and then that's mine, which says it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| I didn't pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| You're more attentive than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Very quickly, so it doesn't really affect too much as far as service goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| but yes, for both purposes, and this one is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| So this person turned 21 on Saturday, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| They turned 21 on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Turned, I thought you said. Okay, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Thank you very much, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| And that's why it shows red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| So since you've been there, you've changed the culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| How have you done that with managers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Yeah, so three of the five, what we would consider front of house managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| that were there during our issues that we have had, are no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| One of which obviously being the general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| So what we're doing for us is trying to change from a culture of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| to a culture of caring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| We were just checking boxes and doing what we were told to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| to not get in trouble before, and I'll be the first one to admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Now we are making sure that we are emphasizing the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| that some of the things that we do in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| can affect people's lives far more than just having fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| while they're there in our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| And so emphasizing that with all of our team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| as well as just our management being present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| We are not email and office managers anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| which was a bit of how it was done previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| We are on the floor, we are present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| we are watching that they are doing the things that we're asking them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| and just making sure that we are there policing the situation as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| which is not how it was previously done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Well, thank you very much for that presentation of your technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| and what you walked through with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| All right, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Thank you, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Mama Kays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=723)|
| 0:12:13| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| We'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Nalon Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| Members of the board, Will Cheek again from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| I can just briefly explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| We have four applications, if that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Just to give you an overview of what we're applying for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| because it's a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| I know when you just see it on the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| I want to first say that I've got Dave Levins standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| He is the general manager for Aramark Sports and Entertainment, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| I also have Dennis Deal, Mr. Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Mr. Deal is the GM for Aramark Higher Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| We call it Higher Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| It's Aramark Educational Services, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| We've also got some guests from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| if you want to stand up and introduce yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| Brian Brown is the executive director of auxiliary services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Janine Lyle, I'm the senior associate AD in the athletic department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| I'm Tim Reese. I'm the director of Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| So, we have four applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| And the reason we have four is we have two facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| but each facility has two different Aramark companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| In the bowl, so in Nalon Stadium, that's the part of the general admission area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| that's operated by Sports and Entertainment, Aramark Sports and Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| That's Mr. Levins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Upstairs, at the club level, that's operated by Aramark Educational Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| That's Mr. Deal, the GM up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| So, we have two separate applications, because there's two separate operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Same concept at Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| In the bowl, we have Aramark Sports and Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| And then in the suites, we have Aramark Educational Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| So, those are the four applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Has the university made a decision if they'll be selling alcohol this season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| And if so, what's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| So, the university has. We don't have specific plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| So, the first event is August 3rd at Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| It is an Alice Cooper concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| I'm told it will be a little bit like an AARP reunion, all over 50 crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| But, in any event, yes, we're planning on serving at the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| The plan right now is there will be beer only in the bowl at Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| At the club level, there's two club levels that are operated by Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| There will be beer, plus there will be wine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Thompson Bowling, I believe it's beer only in the bowl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| in the general admission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| And then the suites would be full bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| And that's operated by higher education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Of course, the suites are not open to college students or the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| Mortals like me can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| And sales, would they end at a certain time, the third quarter or fourth quarter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| Sure. So, we have a comprehensive, responsible alcohol service policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| We're in the process of, we filed a very skeletal version of what we intend to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| We're working with the university to have a state-of-the-art program in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| before our first event on August 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| To hit some highlights, everyone is trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| People that are serving beer are all team trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| It's a training program that is specific for Aramark and that venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| One of the things we do is we go over Red Box ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Remember, I showed you the Red Box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| It's a very simple way to identify somebody who's underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| We also will card everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| There's no exceptions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| We have a two drink maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| You can't get more than two drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| We will be using cups that are distinctive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| So, for example, at Neyland Stadium, we're currently looking at using a black cup for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| And right now, in the bowl, if you get any other beverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| it's served in a clear cup that says UT on it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Correct, or a souvenir cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Or a souvenir cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| So if you are one of the 70 or so t-shirt people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| and you see someone with a black cup, you know that they have a beer in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| If you see them with a clear cup with UT on it or a souvenir cup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| they've got Coca-Cola or something else in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| We plan on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| The SEC has a policy where our cutoff time is at the end of the third quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| We will have cutoff times for each event that depend on how long the event is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| If Alice Cooper is two hours, we'll probably cut off 30 minutes before the end of the concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| So that's just sort of a big picture of what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| We are working carefully with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| We understand we have a lot of people that are underage at the Games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| And avoiding any of those people having an alcoholic beverage, a beer, wine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| at the Games is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And we're very focused on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| We want to make sure that by the time the first game rolls out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| we'll have a good policy and people will be properly trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| Sure. Ms. Wilder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| So I appreciate that you're working so closely with the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| to make sure that the policies that are adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| are sort of tailored to our local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Does Aramark have experience with serving alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| I mean, you're a national organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Are some of these policies and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| corporate policies and practices that are being adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| or are we starting from scratch here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| So they have corporate policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| There's a corporate policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| They're slightly different for the two different Aramark companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| But there's a very comprehensive corporate policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| And then there are specific things that are going to happen at each facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| that are specific to the facilities, tailor the local requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| as well as things that the university wants us to do as far as service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| So Aramark, for example, has a chief compliance officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| whose sole job is the responsible service of alcohol, Julian Deuce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| I was just on the phone with her this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| They have another person that works under her in corporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| So they're working with us on these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| So we will have an addendum to the Aramark sports and entertainment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| that will be specific for Neyland and for Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| I have a question that may seem unrelated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| but is this Aramark the same as the food service Aramark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Do you have any contracts with the Knox County Sheriff's Department here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| for the jail system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| They're not aware of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| We're not serving alcohol there, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| I just wanted to see all the different relationships that we have with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| So you're going to card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| We have a wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Is that part of y'all's plan for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| We've discussed wristbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| The issue with wristbands is a matter of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| So we're working with the university to decide whether or not it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Obviously, the more we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| the better it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| But on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| we have to balance that with the fact that we do need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| that people can get through a line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| So that's one of the things we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I mean, at other pro stadiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| I see that being pretty prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| in the wristbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| I don't know how that would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| And I've seen it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| For example, in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| in a Titans game, you do not get wristbanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| At a Sounds baseball game, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I've seen that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Sergeant Keller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| You've mentioned quite a lot about training your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| to look out for under-21-year-old IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| What sort of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| are you going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| for false IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Because the overwhelming majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| the under-21-year-olds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| a fake ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| from a different number of websites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| And they're actually quite good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| So good, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| that they can beat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| an ID scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And the quite good ones are very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| in particular the ones that beat the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| I will say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| So our training will include...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| There's an ID book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| You've probably seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| The beer wholesalers give them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| to the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Our folks will be trained...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| If you or I present an ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| it's going to be a Tennessee driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| It's not a red box ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| And those are ones where they're going to check them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| and they're just going to confirm that it's you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| in the photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| The ones that they pay more attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| are out-of-state IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| and the ones with the red boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| And so they'll be trained to focus on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| because those are the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| that we're most concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| So let me give you a bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Each...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| So there's an alcohol-compliant supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| At Thompson Bowling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| there's one for higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| and one for sports and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| That person's sole job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| is to walk around and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| people, the servers, are doing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| that they're carding everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| that they're actually looking at the IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| they're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| At Neyland Stadium, sports and entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| will have one alcohol-compliant supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| on each single floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| where they serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| So there'll be someone who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| at a higher training level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| that's available to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| If we see a fake ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| we've got a way to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| There are also managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| that can come over and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| And so our system won't be perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| any more than anyone else's is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| but they will be trained to look for IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| that are suspicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| But most importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| I hope it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Mr. Cheek, thank you for speaking with me earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| let's just use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Mr. Reese's facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So there's going to be suites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| and it's going to have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| and then the educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| will have the other permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| You all understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| that those are considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| two separate premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| and the beer from one can't be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| to the beer other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| That's correct. In fact, there will be no beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| that can be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| That way we don't have any question at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| is that a beer, is that a Jack and Coke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| what it is. There will be no beverages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| that go from the suites at Thompson Bowling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| down into the bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Likewise, the elevator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| security at Neyland Stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| has the same marching orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| We understand that we're responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| It's just like somebody walks out the front door of a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| If they go from one premise to the other premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| then Aramark Higher Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| knows they're responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| to make sure that their customers don't leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| with an alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Realizing that we talked late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| this morning and there hadn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| enough time, when do you all think you might be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| submit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| enhanced plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| for server compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| next week or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| I think a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Because Aramark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| does have in-house compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I have to get everything cleared through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| them. We also have to work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| university. From Aramark's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| perspective, the university is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| their client. They're there to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| the client. We have to run everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| through the university as well as Aramark Corporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I think a couple of weeks would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| reasonable. Easily before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Let's run through the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Sergeant Cowher, where are we on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Neyland Stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| So we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| for fire prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| No, you guys can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| We'll come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| For the stadium, both permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| lack the fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| So my question was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Mr. Cheat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| I assume you'd be the one to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| So I'm going to make the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| or the Aramark managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| that you guys have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| do things differ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| when the employees are under 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| They are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| to serve as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| I don't know if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Coliseum, or not the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| but Thompson Bowling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| or Neyland is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| than maybe a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Some restaurants you go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| the policy is that under 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| servers. I didn't know if you guys would have a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| propensity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| working the concessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| that would be under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| and if that has any impact in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I don't think we'll have more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| under 21, but the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| service age is 18 in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| and so we were intending to have some people that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| between the age of 18 and 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| I'm just thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| because you guys are serving a very high volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| and a very condensed window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Restaurants are busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| but you guys are serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| tens of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| at a small window of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Yeah, to put it in perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| we, Aramark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Sports and Entertainment in the bowl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| expects to have 900 to 1200 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| that will be front line serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| 200 to 300 of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| will be serving beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Is there like a separate line for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| For the most part, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| We will have some stands that are serving beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| but for the most part, we'll have beer only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| I was just trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| in the time frames that you're working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| if you have to switch off staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| because they're not 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| they're 17 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| There will be no 17-year-olds selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| That's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I didn't know if there were 17-year-olds selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| popcorn and soda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| at the same place that a beer would also be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| That was all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| I'm just trying to figure out how that's managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| We will not have anyone under the age of 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| anywhere that beer is being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| If that window sells beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| there's no one under 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| You're doing a great job answering these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I definitely feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| you've put a lot of thought into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| I think you're hearing from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| the questions that you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| that we're very interested in making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| that you have a compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| that is really well buttoned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| What I'm also hearing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| your first event isn't until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| I'm sure that it would be wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| if you could get your beer permit approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| However, we have one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| beer board meeting prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| your August event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| at which you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| plan on selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| I'm leaning towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| making a motion for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| postponement until the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| beer board meeting to give you time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| to finalize your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| I think that would still give you time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| be ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| to serve in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Just based on the questions I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| from my colleagues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| I would at least feel more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| knowing that we're not leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| some dangling loose ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| and just assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| that you'll have everything buttoned up by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Councilman Singh has a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| I would agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| I think having a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I think your word was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| skeletal server compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| plan that you were going to have a more robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| one for us in the next several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| I'd be more comfortable with seeing a more robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| one. The question that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| up to my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| in your presentation just a moment ago was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| when you mentioned the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| multiple parts in the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| where you'd be serving beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| and I was curious how you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| to make sure you only have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| beer transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| when you have multiple different places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| where somebody could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I mean, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Someone could game the system. They could wait in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| and get two beers in some place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| I guess drink them and then go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| get two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Well, no, I appreciate that you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| hey, we want to have this two drink minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| or two drink maximum, but I'm curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| about how you're going to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| You're going to serve two at a time to the same person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Is that what you meant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Yes, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| So if you were to come up and you were to ask for three beers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| we'd say I'm sorry, sir, we can only give you two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| And if you got two beers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I think if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| went to the back of the line and wanted to get two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| the server would say I'm sorry, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I can only give you two beers at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Okay, I guess I just misread that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| because I was thinking you were saying there was a two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| drink maximum for your stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| but it's a two drink maximum per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| time you come up in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Thank you, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| That's what I had questions about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| I was under the same misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| that it was a two drink maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| per evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| but it's just per visit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| the concession stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| That's correct, and that's a rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| that's enforced in a lot of sports venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1822)|

| 0:30:26| about the baseball stadium here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| but I do know that in most sports venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| that I visit there's a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1830)|

| 0:30:34| a responsible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| That way I can get a drink for someone I'm with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| but I can't grab three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1838)|

| 0:30:42| or hand one to somebody who might be underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1842)|

| 0:30:54| about this with volume, with the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=1854)|

| 0:35:50| No food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| made out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I guess I'm hungry today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Popcorn sounds pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| I'm going to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| We've got three to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Chapman Food Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Hi. I'm Preeti Patel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| 7405 Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Okay. You approved pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| in March 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Just kind of get an update and if you need an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Yeah. I need a four-week extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| A one-month extension? Four-week extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I need a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| until the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Aye. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| So she needs to return to the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| No. If she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| all her documentation, she would bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| it to the office for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Extend is the word that I meant to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Sorry. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Will knew what you meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Will could read your mind. I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you, Will. That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Will's got a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Slogers, a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| American restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| That's in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| district, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Yeah. I mean, I know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Well, what are they missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I guess is the question. They still need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| So they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| were approved pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| documentation in the February meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| and then extended in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| May and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| so here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Were they present in the May meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Were they present in the May meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| They were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| They were notified to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| come to that one and to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Yes, ma'am. Yeah. I've spoken with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Mr. Rivez, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| representing the client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| since that last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| as recently as last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Email and a phone message today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| there was some question on their part whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| had been approved by building. I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| verify that with building and so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| two parties were trying to reconcile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| that to get the information to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| So without a motion to extend, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| they would have to reapply, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| They'd have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Without a motion to extend, they'd have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| so when you spoke with them, it seemed like they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| confused about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I don't think, to be fair, they were confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| about the need to appear. At least I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| think so. I think the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| was they understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| that their final building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| inspection had also covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| the beer approval because of the timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| of the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| but that was not the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| I got from building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| So those two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| the applicant and the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| were trying to reconcile that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| give me one unified answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| So can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| clarify with you? So they think they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| had a final building inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Yes, ma'am. But they haven't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Well, the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| had a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| building inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| but the building inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| department, as I understood it from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| had not entered the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| beer permit inspection approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| which kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| flows through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| So they could, even though they may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| have to return to the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| they've adequately inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| it. They don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| request to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| yet. And that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| the information I communicated to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| because that's really confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| I guess the bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| were they aware that they needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| present today? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Yes or no? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Okay. Thank you. That part you weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| confused about. Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you. There is a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| the applicants were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| told by someone in building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| inspections, you're going to be entered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| you'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| There's a chance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| The applicant thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| so. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| My suggestion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| to consider extending it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| 30 days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| see if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| is sitting at their desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| right now, maybe entering it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| these people potentially go through the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| process. Mr. Frost, if they did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| they wouldn't have to appear again. They just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| need to turn in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| notice that they had successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| had this inspection. It could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| on somebody's desk in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| maybe waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| to hit enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| We did clarify, Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| did clarify with them what the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| was. It's not unknown to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| He clarified with them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| building inspection was waiting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| them to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| a beer inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| approval last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Sounds like they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| haven't abandoned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Their intention is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| finish it. Most of these cases it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| seems like it's sort of abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| It seems like they're going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| process. They're waiting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| I'd be willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| give them 30 days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| get it figured out. If they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| appear, then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| we've done all we can do. Motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| extend 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| No. I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| Is someone going to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| up with them? I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| I know what a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| building inspection is. I think if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| opening a new restaurant, there might be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| confusion as to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| needing to make some additional request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Like when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| you call in and do the inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| request on the telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| and you have to, for anybody who hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| done that before, you have to punch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| the button for what you want. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| that where they should have made that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| That's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| There's a specific flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| to the process in building inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and regardless of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| the inspector had been present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| if that beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| permit request had not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| then they wouldn't be able to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| approval later, even if they had done on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| site what's necessary for them to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| the approval. So the inspectors have to revisit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| They may just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| to revisit the paperwork, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| they don't actually have to necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Mark, will you follow up with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| tomorrow and just tell them what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| and where we are and the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| and hopefully get it worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Chairman Wallace, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| to rescind and change my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| to no, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| you have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| very clear that your answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| was yes, they were aware that they needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| here today, regardless of any confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| When there's confusion and uncertainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| you show up and you ask the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| and you get clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Not that I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| to be mean or harsh or anything, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| is very serious and I understand this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| their business and as it being your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| you have a responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| and you did say yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| you told them that they needed to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| today, so I would like to rescind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| and make that a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| True by Hilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Knoxville North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| Good evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2635)|

| 0:44:01| 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| We were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| pending final documentation in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| and extended in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| and here we are, so what's the update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| had some construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| We are doing a new build from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| plan was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| inspections for a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| of occupancy, which would cover all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| paperwork needed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| the beer permit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| June the 28th, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| feel confident that we're going to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| date for a certificate of occupancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| and would like to request a 60 day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| 60 day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| 60 day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| You asked for it, you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| The final thing on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| agenda tonight is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| established in the rate of compensation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| a beer board hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| Mr. Frollis, you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| There's an ordinance that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| the compensation to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| It was last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| done two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| and I don't know when before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| it had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Without telling them why I was asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| I contacted each of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| hearing officers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| independently asked them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| how much time were you putting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| reviewing a file, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| as Councilmember Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| knows, you get a phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| you have to do conflict check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| to make sure there's not some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| issue. Councilmember Starr knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| There's some administrative things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| that go behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| This would, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| proposal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| the uncontested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| ones, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| increases it, I think, $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Some of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| were spending three or four hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| with an individual file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I think, honestly, what they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| earning before was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| a pittance. This makes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| Do you have a comment to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Mr. Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| why I have a comment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| He used your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| as a reference and we were just following up on that reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| You mentioned Mr. Starr as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| So they were making $50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2793)|

| 0:46:37| $225.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| We haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| had an uncontested matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2804)|

| 0:46:52| in over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| These attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| the attorney with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| least experience has probably been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| practicing 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| years. The attorney with the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| experience has been practicing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| around 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I guess since everyone is looking at me, I'll move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| approve. I was going to ask Mr. Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| first. You said the rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| was $225 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| what? Per case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Per week? Per month? Per case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Okay. And it's rotated around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Mr. Johnson spreads them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| out equitably among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| the hearing officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| so that's how it's distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| and each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| has an average of what? Four to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| maybe a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| That sounds about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| And the motion is to up it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| $100 to $325?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Yes. So will this come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| council, Mr. Frost, as a vote or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| is this a vote tonight? This is the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| This is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Okay. So motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| and a second. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| You good? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Was that a no vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| No. It was all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2890)|

| 0:48:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| One of my attorneys has this application. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| four of us in the office and I wasn't aware that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| wanted to push this one tonight. We wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| the board to consider it this night. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2912)|

| 0:49:49| I had understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| from Mr. Cheek's colleague, Mr. Eltonda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| that a local manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| was going to be hired who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=2995)|

| 0:50:09| Can we approve that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| The local manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| would have to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| the background and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3017)|

| 0:50:21| a background on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3021)|

| 0:50:29| What would be the other option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Well, you do have managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| that change out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3033)|

| 0:50:53| to finish the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| That's a requirement of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Does the local contact have to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3057)|

| 0:52:03| delivering beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| And we're not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| if we need to ask this board for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| In Nashville, for example, the GoPuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| store there delivers beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| and the Metro Nashville Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| made a conclusion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| that was a right that was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| under the wine delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| statute. There's a delivery statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| that was passed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| So, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| But it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| retail outlet as well? You sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| on premise? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Who's district is this? Lawrence or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Ms. McKenzie's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| 9th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Which agenda item is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| It's 4E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| That's 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Sorry, I made notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Well, it's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| up to Gwen's lead as far as Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| McKenzie's lead, but I mean there's so many questions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| it seems like a postponement would be prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| But, again, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| would like to hear from my colleagues on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Can I ask what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| pending and what has already been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| So, what is pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| is sales tax registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| certificate of zoning, health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| approval, building inspection approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| fire prevention approval, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| information regarding a local contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| And what has been taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| care of? So, all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| owners and managers that have been listed to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| have had their background checks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| haven't completed tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| They have not had a task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| We have their application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| and their business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| and all the other things that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Thank you. It seems premature for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| go ahead and act when they've just barely begun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| So, I'm going to move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| postpone this one to the next Bear Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| meeting and hopefully we'll have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| of those items completed for further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| review at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| So, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| approved tonight pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Others, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| I mean, we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| for the local contact, but for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| the other inspections, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| I jumped in front of other people, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| I got excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| I may have the same question as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I don't know. We don't always think alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| That's true. I think now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| understanding their business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| I feel like I need some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| time to look at their server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| That is a very different type of model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| So, I could use some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| additional time to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| how they've structured their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| to go along with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| delivery service type of business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Would you also like to know before they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| get here whether they're going to deliver beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I mean, that's a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| We kind of need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| My question was different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| I hear what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| you're saying, that we approve things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Is it common for an application to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| pending in the blanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| on the form, on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| When I look at the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| item 4EA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| in our packet, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| pending, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| Is that part of the issue here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| We don't know who the contact is because they filled out the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| with the actual words pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| It wasn't filled out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I may have misconveyed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| They filled out the notice of contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| and it should be in the packet, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| reflects an address not local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| for the person listed to receive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| So, they need to replace that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| with a person who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| residing within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| So, these parts in the packet, are they typed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| up by you? Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| They didn't put this stuff here that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| pending. You guys do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| I don't know what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Actually, it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| packet page 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| That's the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| The applicant does the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| It says pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| seeing that, yeah, I don't have the actual form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| to see what page, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| the application would be completed by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| It just says list the name of the managers that are on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| List the name of the managers pending, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| The manager, they've not named one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Is that normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| It's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| You know, sometimes an owner will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| fulfill that function, and then later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| a manager, but in this case, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| no one's fulfilled that function yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| All right, so you have a motion. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| No, Mr. Frost. Thank you. Mr. Sheik,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| are you going to be open before July 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Okay, so your shorts wouldn't be in a knot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| postponed a month? Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you. So we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Second. All those in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Nice catch on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| getting a new client there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| I've waited long enough. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| No other business, so you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3435)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293190618?start=3445)|
