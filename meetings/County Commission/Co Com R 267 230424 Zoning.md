|     703 |   708 | Ms. Clark, did you say you don't have any plans to build any more?                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=703.0)  |
|     708 |   709 | No, I don't currently.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=708.0)  |
|     709 |   715 | What I had originally wanted to do was to, you know, when I had a tenant turnover, to                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=709.0)  |
|     715 |   721 | be able to turn the existing structure into four units that would be more affordable rentals.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=715.0)  |
|     722 |   725 | But I don't believe this zoning allows that.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=722.0)  |
|     726 |   731 | You know, if I were to add any additional units, I would have to build additional structures                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=726.0)  |
|     731 |   736 | on the property, you know, within the setback lines and so forth.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=731.0)  |
|     736 |   737 | And it is a large lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=736.0)  |
|     737 |   739 | It's almost two acres.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=737.0)  |
|     739 |   742 | So, you know, that might be something that I would do in the future.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=739.0)  |
|     743 |   748 | I'm not going to do it right now, but I would like to have this zoning approved.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=743.0)  |
|     748 |   756 | I think this zoning is more in line with the existing structure than the agricultural also.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=748.0)  |
|     757 |   758 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=757.0)  |
|     758 |   761 | Yeah, I would agree with the RA as well.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=758.0)  |
|     761 |   767 | So, Madam Chair, I'd like to make a motion to approve this rezoning per the Planning                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=761.0)  |

|    1418 |  1423 | You really gave me great information of what you're going to do and then told me where                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1418.0) |
|    1423 |  1427 | to go to see the projects that you've done over on Dean Hill and they're beautiful.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1423.0) |

|    1440 |  1444 | put the condition in there because it is already in the planning condition.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1440.0) |
|    1445 |  1449 | And you're already aware of that and you've already made that commitment.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=1445.0) |

|    2141 |  2143 | I sent you an email today for that request.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2141.0) |
|    2144 |  2145 | I think this is the second time.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2144.0) |
|    2146 |  2151 | Do we need to suspend the rules, Law Director, to do this, or are we okay with it since I'm requesting it?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2146.0) |
|    2152 |  2153 | The deferral?                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2152.0) |
|    2154 |  2155 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2154.0) |
|    2156 |  2157 | If you're requesting it, it doesn't require suspension of the rules.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2156.0) |

|    2167 |  2168 | Second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2167.0) |

|    2192 |  2193 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2192.0) |
|    2194 |  2198 | So an applicant can keep deferring and deferring and deferring,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2194.0) |
|    2199 |  2202 | but if he came here under our rules, he'd get one deferral,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2199.0) |
|    2203 |  2209 | and then the second time, if he wanted to defer it, it would be withdrawn at that point.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2203.0) |
|    2210 |  2215 | But if he comes to a commissioner, the commissioner can keep going on and on and on and on and on.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2210.0) |
|    2216 |  2217 | Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2216.0) |
|    2218 |  2219 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2218.0) |
|    2219 |  2224 | What our rules say is if an applicant has a right to a single deferral,                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2219.0) |
|    2225 |  2228 | okay, so if he's here the first time or she and says,                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2225.0) |
|    2229 |  2230 | I'd like a deferral, they have a right to that.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2229.0) |
|    2231 |  2232 | The second time, they can't do it.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2231.0) |
|    2233 |  2235 | But commission controls its own agenda,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2233.0) |
|    2236 |  2241 | and the commission can defer as many matters or a matter as many times as it likes.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2236.0) |
|    2242 |  2247 | And as I recall, if I'm not mistaken, this was deferred by the commission the first time.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2242.0) |

|    2253 |  2255 | there's an issue with the title insurance,                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2253.0) |
|    2256 |  2261 | and that title has to be solved before the zoning needs to be taken place.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230424-zoning?start=2256.0) |
