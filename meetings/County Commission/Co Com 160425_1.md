| 2:26:25| Suboxone will not be written out of this clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| It will only be family practice and an immediate care clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| I am a third-generation physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| I wanted to be a physician since I was eight, and I have worked tirelessly to achieve that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| My dad has always taught me to listen to my patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| and continually learn and further my education as it makes me a better doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| I came to a crossroads a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| After moving here from Florida, I was shocked and dismayed to find a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| completely riddled with horrible opiate addiction problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| I spent most of my days in the ER fighting with patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| as to why I would not prescribe pain medications for their ailments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| If I wasn't arguing, I was taking care of the same people over and over again for overdoses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| and having to tell family members that I was not able to save their loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| It was frustrating and sad and, honestly, shook my faith in medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| I was approached by two colleagues at that time that had worked in the ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| as they had started up a facility to medically help people regain their lives drug-free and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| At first, I said, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| I had the same perception that everybody else does about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| Also, my husband happens to be an FBI agent and has worked tirelessly on his career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| and wanted nothing that would tarnish or put his job into danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| They asked me to come and shadow for a day to see if it was anything that I would be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| This is exactly what I did and opened my eyes to a life that I knew nothing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| The more I saw, the more I wanted to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| After long conversations with my father and also my husband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| I decided I would try it out on a part-time basis and continue to work in the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| The more I realized I was doing more good and truly helping people in the clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| than I ever could in the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| I was allowing them to regain family relations and live the lives everybody deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| I became board-certified in addiction medicine and continued to work in the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| Over time, I realized that I was still missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| I missed taking care of the patient and their families and seeing them follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| and knowing what they were doing well and that they had gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| I had gone into Danny's store one day, as we've been longtime clients and friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| and he happened to ask when we were going into business together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| and that's when the light bulb kind of went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| I knew then that all I wanted to do was to be what my father is and what my grandfather was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| and that was a local doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| It's that plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| This statement is not meant to try and convince you of the need for addiction medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| and I won't apologize for the knowledge and experience that it has taught me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| It's to let you know that it was in these crossroads that I realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8933)|
| 2:28:56| that all I had wanted to do was to have my own office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| That chapter in my career is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| and the patients that I have helped will not be part of this new venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8942)|
| 2:29:08| I want to treat patients the way that they should be treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| to have conversations, to help them, and to spend time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| I can't do that if I'm constantly working for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| I can do it if it's my clinic and I set the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| The time in addiction medicine has been valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| and honestly has made me a better physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8965)|
| 2:29:28| but it's not what I want to be doing anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8968)|
| 2:29:31| All I want to do is to be the local doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| I think all my years of training and all the years spent in the ER qualifies me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| for the family issues that occur in medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| I want to take care of the young to the old in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| It's that plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| Good old-fashioned primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| I thank you for your time and taking the time to make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| Counselor Seymour, do you wish to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| If we may, Mr. Overby has a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| and I have an affidavit that I would like to file on behalf of Dr. McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| Please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9005)|
| 2:30:18| Danny Overby, Post Office Box 5174437950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9018)|
| 2:30:25| As you know, I've reached out to each and every one of you trying to express the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9025)|
| 2:30:30| I'm a humble servant in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| I'm in the jewelry business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| The reason I wanted to partner with Carrie is because I know her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| Her husband is a second-generation FBI employee of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9039)|
| 2:30:46| She's a third-generation doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| I have three generations of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9048)|
| 2:30:51| My 83-year-old dad works with me three days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| and my 22-year-old son has just joined our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| There is no way on God's green earth that I would ever be involved with anything like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| for two major reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| One, I took an oath with J.J. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| In return, he made me something that I cherish very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| and I spoke with him today in Hilton Head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| and asked for permission to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9077)|
| 2:31:21| Two, I would never do that to our family business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| because I'm only the steward of this business for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| Kimball's was Hope Brothers before the Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| For 83 years, they have been one of the most prestigious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| and trusted jewelers with your grandmother's belongings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| your mother's belongings, your engagement ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| Arthur's wedding band came from our store many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| I'm going to read a statement for someone relating to the man who said it to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| who is a resident of Shoto Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| What you're seeing here are a few people who were misinformed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| and I apologize that all these horrible things have gone on to each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9116)|
| 2:32:01| and the people behind me as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| because telling the truth is what I'm about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| It's how I've made my living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| It's how I'm trusted with the most precious physical possessions that people have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| and it's how I advise them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9132)|
| 2:32:17| I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars promoting myself as an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| and the fact that I tell the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| Many of you have heard and seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| I give back to this community as often and as much as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| I believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| I'm from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| I choose to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| I love this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| I would like to read an email from one of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| As you know, John suggested that we meet with everybody at the rural metro hall, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| We explained the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| I gave out my business card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| I think I answered many questions from some of you and some of the folks behind me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| But as I was coming down here, I got an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| and I thought maybe I should read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| Maybe you should hear someone else's voice coming from my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| It's from a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| Her name is Jo Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| She offered to let me read this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9193)|
| 2:33:16| It says, Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9196)|
| 2:33:21| My name is Jo Davis, and I am one of the original residents of the mill at Choteau since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9201)|
| 2:33:28| My husband and I are definitely for the proposed family clinic to be located on the corner of Choteau and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9208)|
| 2:33:34| I personally have known Danny Overby and his father, Jim, for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9214)|
| 2:33:38| I grew up visiting Kimball's as a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| and I am proud of Danny's professionalism and how Kimball's has become a mainstay in our Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| I do not believe that the president of Choteau Mill HOA, along with other troublesome residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| should be espousing gossip and indiguous against the doctor or to Mr. Overby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9233)|
| 2:34:01| Fear causes a mentality reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9241)|
| 2:34:04| and their fears have unleashed a tirade of irrational concerns that have no grounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| Once again, I fully support the medical clinic and hope the family medical clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| and hope that the plan for this particular piece of property comes to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| Thank you for your time this evening, Jo Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9258)|
| 2:34:26| I can tell you once again, because this is our only chance to tell the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| we were excluded from all the other HOA meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| We asked if we could come when the folks from Choteau Mills went to the various other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9274)|
| 2:34:40| We were told we were not allowed to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| Not sure that's appropriate, but that's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| It is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| What we have here is it's a family medicine practice, and it's immediate care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| She signed an affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| There are not going to be any drugs on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| Any major thing requiring narcotics is rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| We're going to give you stitches or take care of your kid when he falls at the baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| You guys read that in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| I would like to ask if any of you have questions of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9309)|
| 2:35:13| because I stand here in front of you with absolutely nothing to hide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| and I'm here to answer any and all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| So, please, if you have any, ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| Seeing no further discussion, Counselor Seymour, are you – have you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| We rest, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| Counselor Long, are you representing the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| A portion of the opposition, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9339)|

| 2:35:58| 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2102, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| I'm here to speak in opposition to the application to the amendment of the Southwest Knox County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9363)|
| 2:36:08| and the proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| I'm holding, and would be glad to have our people pass up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9370)|
| 2:36:14| petitions signed by over 450 residents of the neighborhoods of the Millett-Chodo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| Turning Leaf Trails, Chodo Fields, Greystone Court, Bayou Bend, Cabot Ridge, Falcon Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9380)|
| 2:36:29| and Montgomery Cove who support this opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9389)|
| 2:36:35| Our goal is to have a fair debate on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| I think, at least in that, both sides can agree that there's been a great deal of unfortunate misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9398)|
| 2:36:46| There's been a good bit of misinformation circulating around concerning the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9406)|
| 2:36:51| her proposed intentions for the property, and her background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| That's unfortunate because it's made it difficult for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| The applicant has had to correct rumors that have spread about her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| My clients have been threatened personally with legal action for statements they did not make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9423)|
| 2:37:09| And I do take exception at alleging that the president of the HOA or other members within the HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9429)|
| 2:37:17| have spread false rumors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| They have worked diligently and tirelessly to educate people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| and the commission can look back to the MPC minutes on this very issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| when their representative was educating MPC that their concern was not about a pain clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| but was about the potential for treatment for addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9455)|
| 2:37:43| So let me set the record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| The opposition to this rezoning is not about a pain clinic and has never been about a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9465)|
| 2:37:51| The applicant has no history of working in pain clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| does not propose to open a pain clinic at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| and under the proposed zoning could not open a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| The residents of the mill at Choteau know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| and to the extent that that unfortunate term has been used by some people online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| and even by the applicant's attorney at the MPC hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| it has obfuscated the real issues and put everyone in a more difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| I hope that we begin this debate by understanding that no one is here voicing a concern as to a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9497)|
| 2:38:24| My clients have two concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| First, this property is located within their subdivision, not near the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| not next to it, but actually within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| It is recorded on the plat map as lot 19 of the mill at Choteau, which is comprised of 19 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| As a result, the lot is subject to the covenants and restrictions recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| when the subdivision was developed and accepted by each person who purchased a lot within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| Those restrictions state that lots 1 through 18 are to be used exclusively for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| It then goes on to state that no lot shall be used for any commercial, business, or professional purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| It doesn't say lots 1 through 18 won't be used for those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| That would be superfluous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| The only way for the sentence to make sense is to interpret it to mean what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| No lot, including lot 19, will be used for those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| If this commission votes to amend the sector plan and rezone this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| it will almost invariably lead to litigation for the homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| to defend the rights of property owners who rely upon those covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| That's a bad precedent to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| The better rule is that if a zoning decision directly conflicts with the covenants and restrictions for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| by definition, that zoning request is in direct conflict with the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| which requires that new development not impact existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| The second concern is the potential adverse impact this zoning will have upon the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| The proposed rezoning would prevent the creation of a family medical practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| which is what the applicant proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9605)|
| 2:40:08| However, and here's where the problem lies, once that zoning is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9608)|
| 2:40:12| there will be no ability to curtail the use of this property for the treatment of addiction patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| through the prescription of the drug Suboxone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| Dr. McFarland has told you and has submitted an affidavit indicating that that is not her intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| Unfortunately, that's not going to be enforceable once this zoning change gets passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9628)|
| 2:40:34| There are a number of reasons why my clients are particularly concerned about this potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9634)|
| 2:40:40| First, the applicant currently practices at two locations, to our knowledge, in Harriman and Jacksboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9640)|
| 2:40:46| where addiction treatment is a primary part of the practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| which are otherwise designated as family care practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| The practice is called Express Healthcare Clinic and EHC Medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| I see I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| I have about five minutes more worth to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| You have to build your record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| Continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9665)|
| 2:41:06| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| They advertise physicians board certified in addiction medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9669)|
| 2:41:13| I believe that the applicant is one of those board certified physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| but honestly it can be difficult to tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| and I'll defer to the commission to ask her that question if it deems relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| Second, we believe that the site will have difficulty operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| as a traditional family medical practice in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| We have been told that in excess of $3 million will be spent preparing the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9691)|
| 2:41:36| That's a significant debt to carry for the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| Moreover, it will be in direct competition with Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9700)|
| 2:41:44| which is opening a facility directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| There will be a tremendous pressure and incentive to operate a high-volume business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| There is a high probability that current patients will seek, whether she intends or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| to continue treatment with Dr. McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| Third, the description to the facility as a family practice gives no assurance to local residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| that it will not engage primarily in addiction treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| The applicant's partner in EHC recently attempted to open a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| as a family practice in La Follette that specialized in addiction treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| That was denied by the planning commission there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| Further, there are concerns that the operating hours proposed by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| are not in accord with the traditional family practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| but more in line with a high-volume business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| Further, there are credibility issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| I have no doubt that everyone who has stood before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| and everyone involved in this matter is of good intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| However, in making application, the applicant naturally gave her married name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9769)|
| 2:42:54| although she practices medicine under a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| Further, in initial information concerning the project, the doctor's name was misspelled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| making it difficult for the neighborhood to perform any due diligence in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9783)|
| 2:43:09| While these may be honest mistakes, they lend to credibility questions with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9789)|
| 2:43:16| Further, the applicant has stated that months of meetings with the community occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9796)|
| 2:43:20| when in reality it was one meeting, less than a week's notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| and within two weeks of the MPC hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| While the applicant was in no way obligated to have that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| it is incorrect to represent the multiple efforts over months have occurred to vet this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| My clients have no problem and no issue with addiction treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| It's a good thing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| However, it does not belong near or, in this case, within a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| It's a high-volume business bringing in people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| who are going through very difficult times in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| Adding this traffic to the neighborhood is out of character with the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| and will have a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| It seems to me that it's difficult to know exactly what will happen at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9848)|
| 2:44:15| Certainly, Dr. McFarlane has stood before you today and has told you of her intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| Certainly, I believe that my clients have a reasonable belief to think otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9860)|
| 2:44:27| In a situation of uncertainty like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| we would suggest that the better practice is not to allow the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9870)|
| 2:44:35| for this type of operation in or near a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9875)|
| 2:44:40| Concerning traffic, it's worth pointing out that the proposed entrance to this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9880)|
| 2:44:45| is very close to the entrance to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| It will cause difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| We often talk about property rights when discussing these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| The owner of this property is not without use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| MPC has said that it's unsuitable for residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| but there are residences on two of the other three corners of this roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9903)|
| 2:45:09| The lot could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| There's even been some discussion among West Knoxville residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| about purchasing the lot themselves and turning it into a green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| I'd suggest that it's equally important to consider the property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| of those in the subdivision who bought their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| with a secure knowledge of the covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| It's important to consider the property rights of all the neighborhoods in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| which may be impacted by a development which could negatively affect their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| For these reasons, we're asking that this commission vote no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9942)|
| 2:45:48| to the recommendation of MPC in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9948)|
| 2:45:51| I should point out that it's our position that MPC did not have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| to fully examine or investigate the issue of where this property is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| with respect to the covenants and restrictions of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| It's further our position that at MPC it was represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| that suboxone treatment could not occur at this facility under the proposed zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| which is in fact not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| The treatment through the use of suboxone is specifically excluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| from pain management restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| For those reasons, this body is in no way obligated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| to adopt the recommendations of MPC in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9986)|
| 2:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=9994)|
| 2:46:44| Councillor Long said he represented some homeowners associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10004)|
| 2:46:53| Are there other representatives of other groups here in opposition that wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10013)|
| 2:47:04| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10024)|
| 2:47:12| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10032)|
| 2:47:16| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10036)|
| 2:47:17| I'm Lolita Cresson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| I live at 12619 Bridge Path Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| I've been a resident in Cabot Ridge for almost 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10042)|
| 2:47:27| I would like to tell you that our subdivision residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| are adamantly opposed to this because MPC process is inherently flawed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10051)|
| 2:47:39| in how they came about with this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10059)|
| 2:47:42| I'm going to reference the application for this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10062)|
| 2:47:49| and also the MPC Southwest County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10069)|
| 2:47:53| that was adopted in October 2005 by the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| and then also adopted by the Knox County Commission on November 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| At that time, for the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10085)|
| 2:48:09| absolutely no area along North Shore, South North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| was deemed to be planned to have any kind of commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10095)|
| 2:48:21| Then came 2009 and the southeast corner of Choteau and South North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10101)|
| 2:48:31| was deemed commercial and we have the Choteau markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| Now you want to grow this business node with a transitional node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10115)|
| 2:48:42| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| We're 99.9% residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| We move to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| It's prime real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| It's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| We want to live in the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| We can go to Brookline, Kroger in eight minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| and be at Turkey Creek in 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| Why do we need commercial in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| Now let's talk about some of the attributes of why this was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10145)|
| 2:49:12| It was approved first by saying that a roundabout made this a better corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| That is an undersized, inadequate roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| I am almost in a wreck at least once or twice a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| The entrance and exit on that roundabout are so tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10167)|
| 2:49:32| and quite frankly people of East Tennessee do not know how to navigate a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10172)|
| 2:49:39| That's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| I am out with my grandson taking him here and there, appointments, errands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| anywhere from three to five times a day on some of the days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10187)|
| 2:49:53| There are nine subdivisions on North Choteau, Montgomery Cove, Mallard Bay being the largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10193)|
| 2:50:02| from the Trestle Bridge at Virtue to the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10202)|
| 2:50:08| There is a new subdivision which will be another entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10208)|
| 2:50:12| within 300 feet south of the roundabout, Choteau Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10212)|
| 2:50:18| John Hooper is developing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10218)|
| 2:50:21| Choteau Market Road is the access road for the fire trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| to leave the fire station to get on the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10227)|
| 2:50:32| Then you have the close proximity about 50 feet between where the entrance where it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10232)|
| 2:50:40| to the proposed rezoning parcel and the mill at Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| There is not a turning lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| The shoulder is nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| It's a deep gully trench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| Where are you supposed to pull off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| How are we to navigate getting in and out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| Now let's go to North Shore, west of the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| to Loudoun County line at Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| About a mile and maybe just about a little under a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| A fourth of a mile is Phase 5 and 6 of Falcon Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| Another 150 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| Two cars per family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| It's private residential, well, residential, low-density residential housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10281)|
| 2:51:28| added to the other 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| That's 250 total for Falcon Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| Put with that three subdivisions just one-half mile into Loudoun County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10294)|
| 2:51:40| that feeds into south north shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| And three more, Turning Leaf, Cabot Ridge, Arbor Gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10302)|
| 2:51:47| and then Carper Stone on the north Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| And here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| We don't have any estimated traffic impact studies done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10311)|
| 2:51:57| They go back to 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| In 2005, the MPC's report stated that two of the fastest growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10320)|
| 2:52:07| highest percentage increase in Knox County, this sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10327)|
| 2:52:13| is south north shore and Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| We have thousands of trips a day per family on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10338)|
| 2:52:24| But the MPC only judges the impact on each little rezoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10344)|
| 2:52:32| They do not look at the total ball of wax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| They do not consider the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| This 32% housing starts, that was the highest in the county during this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| I dare say it's even higher than that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| That little corridor, the south north shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10367)|
| 2:52:53| cannot accommodate all this increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| The mill at Choteau, you have no idea what Don Gallo is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| to that little business node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| That's the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| In Hardin Valley, they have to use a vacant lot to park the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10385)|
| 2:53:10| It is a very popular restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10390)|
| 2:53:13| I really feel that the MPC did not do their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10393)|
| 2:53:18| And you've been given information that is, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| it's devoid of facts because there aren't any available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| The MPC is just now going to start the review of the southwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| It is premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| It is not able to accommodate this kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| We don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10415)|
| 2:53:36| We don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10416)|
| 2:53:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10418)|
| 2:53:49| I would ask that you try to limit delaying our getting the discussion before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10429)|
| 2:53:57| Commissioner Anders, did you have a question of Ms. Cresson or Mr. Long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| It was the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| We've heard both sides of the discussion on the covenants of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10447)|
| 2:54:13| and how it pertains to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| What's the law department's opinion since the other two attorneys have opposite ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10455)|
| 2:54:21| The covenants are a private matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10461)|
| 2:54:25| While I'm not prepared to go as far as to say they shall not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10465)|
| 2:54:29| or cannot ever be considered as part of your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| they shouldn't be a primary consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| Zoning operates on one level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| and then private agreements between landowners and covenants operate on another level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10479)|
| 2:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10485)|
| 2:54:48| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10488)|
| 2:54:58| My name is Steve Robinson, 12523 Choteau Mill Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| First, I want to take an opportunity and ask everyone that's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| that's in opposition to this to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10506)|
| 2:55:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| A couple points that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10520)|
| 2:55:21| I understand where you're coming with the right of the covenants and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10521)|
| 2:55:25| and it being a private matter between landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| When that piece of land, and this would be the argument that I would make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| that piece of land is considered a part of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10531)|
| 2:55:34| it forces, if a government entity decides that they want to change the zoning of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10534)|
| 2:55:39| it forces the neighborhood into almost guaranteeing a legal action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10539)|
| 2:55:45| which puts an undue burden on those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| When I purchased my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| and I too am one of the original owners in the mill at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10549)|
| 2:55:52| that was considered lot 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| This is the fourth civic meeting that I've been about with that lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10554)|
| 2:55:59| first with regards to commercial zoning and now this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10559)|
| 2:56:04| It's something that we've had to deal with from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10564)|
| 2:56:08| and it's creating an undue burden on us by the fact of government wanting to step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| and rezone that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| What's to say somebody on the opposite side of the roundabout in Choteau Fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| decides that they get a great offer for their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| and they want to sell it because somebody is going to put an office place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10583)|
| 2:56:26| It's going to set a precedence that's not what we want in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10586)|
| 2:56:32| Secondly, I'd like to talk about a meeting that I had with Mr. Overby and Dr. McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10592)|
| 2:56:40| I stood up and I presented for the MPC and in opposition of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10600)|
| 2:56:49| When the meeting was over, I had a very good conversation with Mr. Overby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| and he invited me to sit down with him and talk with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| which I did the next day with him and Dr. McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| We had a great conversation, sat down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| and it was my hope that we could find a compromise in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10622)|
| 2:57:07| Through the conversation and my questions to Dr. McFarland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| it became clear to me that she was an addiction physician, board certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10632)|
| 2:57:18| I work with physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| When they spend time, money, and energy to become certified, it's typically what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| At MPC and the meeting that was had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| which I was not in attendance with the homeowners at the mill at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| it was presented to us that she was an ER doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10653)|
| 2:57:36| In my separate meeting, she said she was locums, which means she does that on a part time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10656)|
| 2:57:42| Her answer to me was her full time job was with Express Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10662)|
| 2:57:48| That's what's causing us concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| It's not what's going to happen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| We understand what she signed in the affidavit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| but it's what happens when things get tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| and all of a sudden that $3.5 million debt load that they're having to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| is really a burden to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| Do you go back to what you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| Do you go back to what your board certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| That's the concern that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| Furthermore, the last point I'd like to make, since the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| it's come to our attention that Tenova has signed an agreement with Choteau Markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10696)|
| 2:58:23| to put a clinic in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| That's essentially going to be giving us the exact same service that Dr. Bentley is offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10707)|
| 2:58:34| We're going to have a walk-in clinic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10714)|
| 2:58:36| Is it really necessary in deep rural West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10716)|
| 2:58:40| for us to have two competing medical clinics feet apart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10720)|
| 2:58:45| I don't think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| I think the area is going to be served by a known healthcare provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10727)|
| 2:58:50| that's going to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| It would just create more concern as far as the viability of both of those clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| and what happens in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| We appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| I would ask that you vote in favor or opposed as the neighbors here wish you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10742)|
| 2:59:09| Vote no. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10749)|
| 2:59:18| My name is William Powers, and I live at 12644 Core Reef Circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10758)|
| 2:59:23| and I live in Choteau Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| I represent myself, my family, and our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| We have about 46 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10770)|
| 2:59:31| We're going to be right across from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| We have homeowners that will be able to see this office practice within the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10773)|
| 2:59:39| We are adamantly and unanimously opposed against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10779)|
| 2:59:44| To our attention, we were never invited or reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10784)|
| 2:59:50| or contacted by the group at any form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10790)|
| 2:59:56| I think our major concerns are, is obviously Lot 19 being rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10796)|
| 3:00:02| as a part of their current neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| and then concerns around the traffic and a little ordering the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10805)|
| 3:00:10| and I think the rest of the team has really done a great job at explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| But our neighborhood and all of our residents unanimously oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10818)|
| 3:00:27| My name is Bob Malone, and I represent Bayou Bend Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10827)|
| 3:00:35| I would like to make two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| These points have already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| I would like to reiterate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| There needs to be some vision given to the impact of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10843)|
| 3:00:51| that is going to be on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| It is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| It is going to become more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| Getting out early in the morning, even entering North Shore Drive, is a task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10860)|
| 3:01:08| It is also an unsafe task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| We bought our property thinking that we were living in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10872)|
| 3:01:18| We love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| We see no reason to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| And if we let this out, the potential for changing our way of life is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10883)|
| 3:01:33| It is time for us to give some thought to what happens 15 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10893)|
| 3:01:40| We have been told that North Shore is on the low priority list for widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10900)|
| 3:01:49| And if you travel that road, and I encourage you to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| it is a very narrow road, and as you meet a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10913)|
| 3:01:58| you have no place to go because the shoulder is dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10918)|
| 3:02:03| and you stand to turn over if you go off that shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10923)|
| 3:02:07| I would encourage you to vote in favor of our opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10927)|
| 3:02:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10933)|
| 3:02:20| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10940)|
| 3:02:21| My name is Kari Price, and I'm at 12751 Earlywoods Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| which is in the Ridgewood subdivision off of Harvey Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| about a mile from the area that's being discussed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10949)|
| 3:02:34| I would speak on behalf of myself and the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| I grew up in that Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| I moved away for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| When the opportunity came for me to move back to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10962)|
| 3:02:45| I chose to bring my family here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| This was a good place for us to raise our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| because of the residential nature of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| and we want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| I come from, I personally come from a long line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| of entrepreneurs and even some in the medical field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| and I don't have an issue with Miss Dr. Bentley McFarland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10983)|
| 3:03:08| whatever your name might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| to do your practice wherever you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| except for in a highly residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| We would like to keep it agricultural and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=10997)|
| 3:03:21| and that is what I think everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11001)|
| 3:03:24| in that area would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| And so we encourage you guys, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| to vote against this for our family's sake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| and for everybody in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11017)|
| 3:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11018)|
| 3:03:46| We have had seven speak against this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11026)|
| 3:03:53| We've heard about traffic, covenants, business decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11033)|
| 3:03:58| and how many months this has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| Sir, I'll take you as the last person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11041)|
| 3:04:05| to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11045)|
| 3:04:06| Your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11048)|
| 3:04:09| My name is Ken Marston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11049)|
| 3:04:10| I live at Hidden Cove off of Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| Mainly I came representing our homeowners association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| for edification as we were getting stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| from two different sized newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| but were unsure of what was actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11062)|
| 3:04:26| My questions of the group is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| If you turn down her location at where she wants now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11070)|
| 3:04:34| is there anything to stop from moving across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| into the development that's occurring there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11077)|
| 3:04:38| where Tenova would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| I see Mr. Andrews is shaking his head no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| and Brad and I know each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| so I'm gonna respect that that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| I mean, it's already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11086)|
| 3:04:47| I mean, Tenova's moving there without a rezoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| so it's already zoned commercially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| No big commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| Okay, so am I fair in assuming then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11092)|
| 3:04:57| that the main opposition is to the location of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| but the actual operation of the practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| if she moved across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| would be allowed to go on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| Okay, I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11109)|
| 3:05:10| I understood the thing correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11110)|
| 3:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| Councilor Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| Mr. Wright, before Mr. Seymour takes his final word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11121)|
| 3:05:26| I wanted to make sure and I failed to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| we submitted an applicant or some material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11131)|
| 3:05:32| We need to get the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11132)|
| 3:05:33| I need you to move to a microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| so we'll have you on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11134)|
| 3:05:40| I wanted to make sure to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| before Mr. Seymour got the final word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11141)|
| 3:05:44| We submitted some materials, a position statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| on behalf of the Mill at Choteau to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| and to each of the commissioners individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| We would like to make those part of the record as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| if they've not already been incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| Do you have another copy, Mr. Long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| Do we have, excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11158)|
| 3:05:59| Do you have another copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11159)|
| 3:06:00| I have one more copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| I can get additional copies made if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| Actually, I believe your law director has a copy on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| But I think he needs one for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11167)|
| 3:06:12| That is received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11175)|
| 3:06:20| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11180)|
| 3:06:24| First, in response to the statements that have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| I want to thank Mr. Long for his attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| at quelling the false rumors that have been spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| about Dr. McFarland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| His firm has represented her in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11199)|
| 3:06:42| in a matter in which her credibility was at issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| And they stood by her for the truth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| And I appreciate him trying to do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| I don't think he's been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| The last speaker pointed out correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11215)|
| 3:06:59| that a medical clinic could and apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| is moving into the center directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11222)|
| 3:07:10| And that, we understand, will be manned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| by a PA or a physician's assistant, not a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11232)|
| 3:07:15| It'll be mainly a referral on to the Tenova system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| either at Turkey Creek or Tenova Central downtown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11240)|
| 3:07:26| Traffic seems to be some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11246)|
| 3:07:29| And Mr. Chairman, you said that was one of the issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11249)|
| 3:07:34| The goal of Dr. McFarland's clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| is to serve the immediate community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| So people can go to a medical family practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11261)|
| 3:07:46| where they can be treated in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11266)|
| 3:07:49| without having to go to Turkey Creek, to Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11269)|
| 3:07:55| or to another medical facility in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11275)|
| 3:07:59| This is the way Dr. McFarland wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| to practice medicine the way it used to be practiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11282)|
| 3:08:05| When I grew up, we had a doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| I grew up over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| It's a neighborhood that's gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11290)|
| 3:08:11| But we had a doctor within two blocks of our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| The mothers loved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| They could take us over there for our stitches, shots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| and for whatever other injuries we had caused to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11301)|
| 3:08:26| Very convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11306)|
| 3:08:26| And that's what she wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| I would like to address, one, the covenants area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11309)|
| 3:08:35| That, as Mr. Sanders pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| is an area of private contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11317)|
| 3:08:41| If that is an issue, it will be decided in the Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11321)|
| 3:08:44| for Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| We're not asking you all to decide that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| And that's why I mentioned that Mr. Wise, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| has said that's an issue not to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| in a zoning context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| Finally, I would like to have Mr. Overby explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| about his conversation with the gentleman who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| spoke just a few minutes ago, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| Very briefly, I did invite Steve Robinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| to have a conversation with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11354)|
| 3:09:15| And we did have a nice conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| We had reached what he told me he thought was an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11357)|
| 3:09:22| If we would come out of our pocket for about $700| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11362)|
| 3:09:27| on a gate for their community, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| would be fine with this particular proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11369)|
| 3:09:33| And once some of these vicious attacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11373)|
| 3:09:37| personally on Dr. McFarland and eventually to me, started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11377)|
| 3:09:44| I called Steve and I said, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| to have to retract our offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| And I think the best recourse at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11389)|
| 3:09:53| is simply to settle this matter before you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| and then more than likely in a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| So there's a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| which is the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11407)|
| 3:10:08| I just have a few questions here I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| like to make sure I know the answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| And Mr. Long may know the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| or Arthur may know the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| First of all, who owns the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11420)|
| 3:10:25| Victor J. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11425)|
| 3:10:29| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| Victor J. Phillips III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| OK, but he's not here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11433)|
| 3:10:34| And the Gibbs and the Mary Hines Trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| Just so I'm clear, Mr. Long, they're opposed to the clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11439)|
| 3:10:48| any business, or just the land being developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11448)|
| 3:10:52| I'll come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11453)|
| 3:11:02| The residents of the actual subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| are opposed to the development of any business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| would violate the covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| And while I agree with the county law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| that that is not in your all's wheelhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| to determine whether or not the covenants and restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11474)|
| 3:11:17| necessarily apply, we think as a matter of policymaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11477)|
| 3:11:21| when you look at land use decisions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| are in conflict with neighborhoods, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11483)|
| 3:11:26| is for this body to determine, that you can account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| for the fact that if this proposed development violates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11489)|
| 3:11:33| the covenants and restrictions, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11493)|
| 3:11:34| will be contrary to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| and therefore against the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| That's a very long answer to your short question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11499)|
| 3:11:42| No, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| I wanted to be sure I was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| If it was across the street, would they be opposed to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| They would be opposed to it, but they would have no ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| When were these signatures collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| I'm going to have to defer to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| They were over the course of several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| through petitions circulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11522)|
| 3:12:03| I will tell you, we have made our best attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| to call the names down to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11526)|
| 3:12:08| only different signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11528)|
| 3:12:10| Several of them were signed anonymous online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11530)|
| 3:12:13| And in fact, leading credence to the difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11533)|
| 3:12:16| this debate has caused, there were some online comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| posted regarding opposition to a pain clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11539)|
| 3:12:23| Now, we don't think those were, by any stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| the majority of the comments, but they did appear online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11545)|
| 3:12:28| And that's been part of the battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| that we have been fighting, is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| that a full and fair debate occurs on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11551)|
| 3:12:35| Has Lot 19 been paying HOA dues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11555)|
| 3:12:39| There was actually a lawsuit in Knox County Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11559)|
| 3:12:42| as to whether Lot 19 was required to pay HOA dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11562)|
| 3:12:47| The court denied summary judgment on the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| and the parties reached a settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| And it's my understanding that that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11572)|
| 3:12:53| is currently paying dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| Just a moment, Mr. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| Commissioner Andrews, I think, has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| Yeah, and you and I had lunch, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11581)|
| 3:13:04| talked a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11584)|
| 3:13:05| And I guess when we left lunch, I still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11585)|
| 3:13:10| went back and drove out there, then looked at the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11590)|
| 3:13:12| And this lot has no access to the subdivision, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11592)|
| 3:13:18| Again, I'm going to have to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11598)|
| 3:13:19| They are nodding their heads, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| Of course, it hasn't been developed to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| but it sits on the end of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| It's not within the gate of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| but it is platted as part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| It has no access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11613)|
| 3:13:34| I guess it can't turn, and you can't turn out of this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| on the Choteau Mill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| No, apparently you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| And so the lawsuit that you spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| and I guess really the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| the lawsuit you spoke about was a settled lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| So we don't really know the covenants and easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11632)|
| 3:13:56| I mean, I know they settled it and paid some fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11636)|
| 3:14:00| Did anybody challenge the ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| What we do know is that the owners of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| filed for summary judgment asking the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| to declare that they were not subject to the covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| and restrictions with respect to homeowners association dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11651)|
| 3:14:15| The court declined to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| The court stated that the owner of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| had not put on sufficient proof to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| that it was not entitled or it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| subject to the covenants or restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| We've included a copy of the opinion in the materials that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| were submitted to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| We take the position that the court made a pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| statement that the definition of a lot and the use of this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| put it within the terms of the covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| I'm John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| I am your Knox County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| I have never, ever, ever said that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| wanted to put a methadone clinic on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| I've been trying since about April the 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11706)|
| 3:15:10| to get that message out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11710)|
| 3:15:12| A lot of you know me from my past background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11712)|
| 3:15:17| as the president of the Council of West Knox County homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| And I would never do something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11721)|
| 3:15:24| to a homeowners association or a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11724)|
| 3:15:28| So I was also one of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| who was targeted with false statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| And it seemed like every time I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| trying to communicate what was actually going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| it actually made things worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11739)|
| 3:15:42| But I've said to most of those that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| talked to on the phone or by email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| that I would support whatever decision you guys made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| You guys made a statement back to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| that you are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11756)|
| 3:15:58| So I am going to vote no on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| And I'm prepared to make a motion that we deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11761)|
| 3:16:06| the rezoning request for one simple rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11766)|
| 3:16:10| And that was a land use issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| When the Choteau Markets was established back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11772)|
| 3:16:19| John, 2009, the community agreed at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11779)|
| 3:16:26| to have commercial development on those acres only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| and nothing else further down North Shore Drive or Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| The community reminded me of that again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| that that was the agreement between the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| Planning Commission and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| if they approved the Choteau Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| That is not part of Choteau Markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| So therefore, it does not belong for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| other than residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| So at an appropriate time, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| to make a motion to deny the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11819)|
| 3:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11820)|
| 3:17:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| Councilor Long, you've noted a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| referred to a couple of times, a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| Is there one pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11846)|
| 3:17:29| To challenge this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| No, there's not a lawsuit pending at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| Right now, the property is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| There's no threat or immediate threat or damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| until the rezoning occurs and a proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| How did it get zoned agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11862)|
| 3:17:45| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11865)|
| 3:17:46| How did it get zoned agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11866)|
| 3:17:47| I would have to go back and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11867)|
| 3:17:49| I imagine that was the original zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| And when the subdivision was put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| they never changed the zone for that particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11874)|
| 3:17:56| But it's part of this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| That is our position, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11879)|
| 3:18:00| The parcel was zoned PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| Well, the residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11882)|
| 3:18:05| was zoned lots 1 through 18 PR, and lot 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11885)|
| 3:18:08| remained agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| It's part of a parcel, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| You can't zone part of a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| Well, I defer to the commissioner on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| Right, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| That's correct, although this parcel could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| have been a separate parcel at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| And I'm sorry, I was not here when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| the original or the rezoning for the development occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11903)|
| 3:18:27| So I can't answer that question immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11907)|
| 3:18:30| I can do some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11910)|
| 3:18:31| But my best answer would be that that parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11911)|
| 3:18:35| was divided in a separate parcel at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| Well, then it can't be part of Choteau Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11919)|
| 3:18:44| It could be the same as that overall Choteau Mill was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11924)|
| 3:18:48| subdivided into several parcels, with all those parcels being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| subject, as I understand, to the covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11931)|
| 3:18:57| But as far as when the zoning was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| now, I served on MPC, and I've been on this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| going on eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| We've never been able to zone part of a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11946)|
| 3:19:11| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11951)|
| 3:19:12| It's all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11952)|
| 3:19:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11953)|
| 3:19:13| I don't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| My clients have corrected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| The actual present designation is low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11956)|
| 3:19:20| slash agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| So there is an LDR zoning on the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| That's a planned designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| That's a planned designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| Excuse me, planned designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11971)|
| 3:19:35| It appears to me that this is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| to be winded up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11977)|
| 3:19:38| We go approve something today, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| sticking our neck in the noose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11980)|
| 3:19:44| As far as saying, you know, this is what we agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| should have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11986)|
| 3:19:47| So what's the court going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11987)|
| 3:19:48| They're going to reverse our decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| I don't know that we're ready right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| to make a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11992)|
| 3:19:53| I think, possibly, it should be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11993)|
| 3:19:54| Yes, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=11994)|
| 3:20:01| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12001)|
| 3:20:10| You know, those of you who have worked up here with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| for a while know that 99% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| I support neighborhoods and what neighborhoods want when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| comes to zoning questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12017)|
| 3:20:22| However, I've been very, very disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| by the way this has unfolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| I feel that there has been a lot of misinformation that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12029)|
| 3:20:32| been circulated, and some people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| made efforts to correct that, but a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| have pushed it on further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| I feel that maybe some more meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12042)|
| 3:20:46| might help in this situation to help the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| parties understand each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| One of the issues I have is the statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12051)|
| 3:20:54| that even if this clinic, this family practice clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| were going to open across the street where it's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12058)|
| 3:21:01| zoned properly, there are people who would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| be opposed to it, which tells me that they simply don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| what this doctor says about what her plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12069)|
| 3:21:14| I will tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12074)|
| 3:21:18| Please allow the commissioner to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| And Amy, excuse me, Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| You know you can call me Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12085)|
| 3:21:26| I know I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12086)|
| 3:21:27| Do we have a nephew yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12087)|
| 3:21:30| No, I'm sorry, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| But we've just started hour 17 of labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| and everybody's getting a little tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| What I was going to ask of you, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| is if you have questions of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12100)|
| 3:21:41| Yes, I'm getting to my question, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12101)|
| 3:21:44| are a couple of comments that I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| to make first about why I think this question is pertinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| I have to say that the attitude that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12110)|
| 3:21:52| seen displayed towards this physician and what she may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12112)|
| 3:21:55| or may not face in the future regarding her practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| and any debt that she may carry, they've been patronizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| I think that the remarks tonight, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12123)|
| 3:22:06| I'm tremendously disappointed in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| I've seen from what I believe to be good neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12128)|
| 3:22:13| what I always believe in neighborhoods and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12133)|
| 3:22:16| And I think that some of the remarks and the behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| that I've seen tonight have been offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12139)|
| 3:22:22| And I'm very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| And I would like to give an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| for these neighborhoods and this doctor and Mr. Owenby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12147)|
| 3:22:33| to try to come together and understand each other better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| before we take a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12156)|
| 3:22:41| And I think it might be good for commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12161)|
| 3:22:44| too, to do a little more research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12164)|
| 3:22:46| and ask a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| So I would like to ask if we can postpone this for 30 more days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12167)|
| 3:22:52| and see if we can't come to, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12172)|
| 3:23:04| I'm trying to do what's in everyone's best interest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| That's what we're all trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12186)|
| 3:23:10| So I would like to ask us all to consider if that might not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12190)|
| 3:23:13| be a good option at this point, where people can come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| and try to understand each other a little better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| clean up some of the misinformation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| so that everybody feels a little better going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12200)|
| 3:23:23| and has more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| Thank you, Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| Commissioner Bussler, do you have questions of the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12207)|
| 3:23:31| No, I just was going to ask Mr. Green a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12211)|
| 3:23:35| What does your record show that that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| is zoned as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| The property is zoned according to our zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12221)|
| 3:23:45| I looked at it and I'll look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| It's agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12228)|
| 3:23:50| It is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| The zoning is agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| The plan designation is LDR, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12234)|
| 3:23:58| The zoning map shows all of Choteau Mill as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12238)|
| 3:24:04| As ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12244)|
| 3:24:05| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12245)|
| 3:24:08| Seeing no further discussion, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12248)|
| 3:24:12| questions of commission of any of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| that have appeared before us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12255)|
| 3:24:19| If not, I will ask for a motion, but before I receive a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| I would prefer, this is just my preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12264)|
| 3:24:27| that we have before us an affirmative vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12267)|
| 3:24:33| so that it can be up or down supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12273)|
| 3:24:37| by the majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12277)|
| 3:24:42| If it's cast a negative, it has to have six affirmative votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12282)|
| 3:24:46| to come out negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12286)|
| 3:24:47| That's the only reason I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12287)|
| 3:24:50| Am I coming across there, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12290)|
| 3:24:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12292)|
| 3:24:55| I'll ask the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12295)|
| 3:24:59| The appellate courts have recently opined on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| And to act on an application, the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| needs the affirmative vote of a majority of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12306)|
| 3:25:09| So however you phrase your motion to carry the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12309)|
| 3:25:15| you have to have a majority vote in the affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12315)|
| 3:25:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12320)|
| 3:25:21| Then I will allow any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12321)|
| 3:25:25| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12325)|
| 3:25:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12332)|
| 3:25:36| I'd like to make a motion to deny 3-E-16-SP, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12336)|
| 3:25:45| would be amending the Southwest Sector Plan to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12345)|
| 3:25:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| That's a proper motion, and it has been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12353)|
| 3:25:58| Now then, commissioners, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12358)|
| 3:26:05| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| I'll make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| Yeah, I'd just like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| to postpone for 30 days to give us more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12370)|
| 3:26:15| to meet with the applicant and with the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12375)|
| 3:26:19| to try to reach a more amicable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12379)|
| 3:26:23| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12383)|
| 3:26:24| And I don't think it's us that needs the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12384)|
| 3:26:26| I think it's the two sides that need to take the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| because there is a lot of bitterness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12388)|
| 3:26:31| And certainly, somewhere in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| there's got to be a meeting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12393)|
| 3:26:36| I agree, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| Did y'all just agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12399)|
| 3:26:40| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12400)|
| 3:26:42| It happened earlier today, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| I'm starting to get a little scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| All right, you may strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12405)|
| 3:26:48| Well, if Mike and I agree, then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| know it's got to probably be a pretty good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| Substitute motion before us is to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12415)|
| 3:27:00| With the caveat that they will get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12420)|
| 3:27:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| No, Commissioner Brown, Commissioner Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12428)|
| 3:27:11| they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12431)|
| 3:27:12| They're not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12432)|
| 3:27:13| That's the reason I read the rules earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12433)|
| 3:27:16| You're in discussion with your fellow commissioners right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12436)|
| 3:27:21| I'll still put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| We have before us a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| to postpone for 30 days, with the caveat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| that the two parties get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12450)|
| 3:27:32| Do I hear discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12452)|
| 3:27:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| What would you like the two parties to get together on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| It's either rezoning from agricultural slash low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12465)|
| 3:27:50| residential to office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| How do you get to a compromise on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12474)|
| 3:27:59| First off, I think they've got to become friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| before they can make a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| Commissioner Brown, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12484)|
| 3:28:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12486)|
| 3:28:08| I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| I'm going to let Sam speak first, since I've already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12492)|
| 3:28:15| If I need to add anything after Sam speaks, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12498)|
| 3:28:20| I just wanted to respond to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12500)|
| 3:28:24| And it sounds like there has been a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12504)|
| 3:28:28| And I think I heard from Mr. Overby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12508)|
| 3:28:31| that there's been an attempt, whether there has or has not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| he has not had, as we looked at all of these subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| there's a lot more than just Choteau Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12518)|
| 3:28:39| So I do think that there's additional conversations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12519)|
| 3:28:44| can be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| And in the past, we've had very contentious issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12526)|
| 3:28:50| that once they, and emotions were high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| but once they heard things like, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| can happen across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| I don't know if that's news to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12537)|
| 3:28:58| Maybe it is, maybe it's not, in terms of all those subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12538)|
| 3:29:02| that maybe once the doctor has had a chance to appeal, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12542)|
| 3:29:09| to the other subdivisions, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| might be some compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| Again, might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12553)|
| 3:29:14| But again, 30 days is 30 days, and this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12554)|
| 3:29:18| would be right back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12558)|
| 3:29:19| But just to respond to what can happen in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12559)|
| 3:29:24| in my time here, I've seen a lot happen within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12564)|
| 3:29:29| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12569)|
| 3:29:34| Before us properly is the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12574)|
| 3:29:40| to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12580)|
| 3:29:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12586)|
| 3:29:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| We're going to roll call vote, beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12589)|
| 3:29:52| with Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12592)|
| 3:29:55| Who's getting called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12595)|

| 3:33:45| is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| The commission found that the zoning at the requested density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12827)|
| 3:33:52| is consistent with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| and will allow uses compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12834)|

| 3:34:19| So is this that entire stretch of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12859)|
| 3:34:22| between the subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=12862)|

| 3:47:32| it ain't all kosher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13652)|

| 3:47:43| It is best to let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13663)|
| 3:47:46| Is that it, Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13666)|

| 3:48:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| I'm sorry I didn't bring my notes with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13682)|
| 3:48:03| but I was following a bill that was going to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| legislator that dealt with the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13686)|
| 3:48:09| And since Mr. Green was here and the law directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13689)|
| 3:48:13| I was wondering if they know what happened with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13693)|
| 3:48:17| I'm happy to provide you with a report next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13697)|
| 3:48:22| I'll do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13702)|
| 3:48:22| I'll even beat our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13702)|
| 3:48:24| We get updates from a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13704)|
| 3:48:29| Not when we pay for it, when someone else pays for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13709)|
| 3:48:32| And I'll provide that update on that bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13712)|
| 3:48:34| and other planning related legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13714)|

| 3:48:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13718)|
| 3:48:39| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13719)|
| 3:48:40| Yeah, just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13720)|
| 3:48:42| Mr. Green, on that B&B builders, this is a second time no show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13722)|
| 3:48:47| Have we had any contact with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13727)|
| 3:48:51| I'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13731)|
| 3:48:51| And to be honest, I don't know whether this is good or bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13731)|
| 3:48:55| but I'm at a level where often they don't talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13735)|
| 3:49:00| Maybe a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13740)|
| 3:49:02| I didn't know if somebody had contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13742)|
| 3:49:04| We do send out a notice letting them know when the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13744)|
| 3:49:08| hearing ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13748)|
| 3:49:10| But to my knowledge, we have not received a call from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13750)|
| 3:49:13| asking for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13753)|
| 3:49:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13754)|
| 3:49:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13757)|
| 3:49:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13758)|
| 3:49:19| I just want to compliment Mr. Green on the new MPC website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13759)|
| 3:49:23| that it's much more friendly to the user,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13763)|
| 3:49:27| and you guys are doing a great job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| It makes it much easier for us to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13773)|
| 3:49:33| All I did was tell the person in charge to make it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| and the rest was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13776)|
| 3:49:40| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160425?start=13780)|
