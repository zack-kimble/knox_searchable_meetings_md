| 0:00:00| 5.01 p.m., and as usual, I'd like to start this workshop off with an invocation and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=0)|
| 0:00:13| pledge. If I could ask Councilman Della Vopi to lead us in the invocation, and I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=13)|
| 0:00:18| to ask the mayor to lead us in the pledge. Oh, Lord, we bow our heads as we are reminded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=18)|
| 0:00:27| of the power of the forces of nature that have swept through the south in our area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=27)|
| 0:00:34| injured people and damaged homes, and we're thankful that our area was spared relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| to others, and we reach out with our hearts and minds to those who were hurt. Finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| we ask that you help this body as it struggles to balance the problems of protecting our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| scenic hillsides and nature with the rights of property owners who, of course, desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| to be unmolested by the control of government. So give us the patience and the wisdom to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| address these issues. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=65)|
| 0:01:13| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=73)|
| 0:01:20| and justice for all. I'd like to thank Susan Wilson with the City Recorder's Office for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| being with us, and if you could please call the roll. Vice Mayor Bailey? Here. Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| Here. Councilman Della Vopi? Here. Councilman Grieve? Here. Councilman Palmer? Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| Pavlis? Here. Councilman Roddy? Here. Councilman Thomas? Here. Councilman Woodhull? Here. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| you. Before we get started on today's subject matter, I'd like to ask David Brace if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| would to come forward and give us an update on the damage to the city and the cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| operation. I spoke to David earlier today, and I was impressed by what the city's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| and always proud of what they do for us, and I thought maybe it would be nice if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| shared it with you. So, David, if you could go ahead. Thank you, Dave Brace, City Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| Service, 2150 Maplewood Drive. I've got a handout, so I won't go into too much detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Bottom line, we've worked a lot this week, just like police and fire, and are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| continue to work to get the yard waste, the tree debris that is down, picked up. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| actually working over tonight, we're going to work over Friday, and we're going to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| up this Saturday. That's really just an attempt to get our arms around the problem. It's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| to take us several weeks to actually get all of the yard waste collected from our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| So we're issuing a press release. Bottom line, we're going to get it. If neighbors and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| have debris, get it to the street. We're going to pick it up. We're going to do away with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| our size limitation. We typically have a 6x6x6 pile that we pick up every two weeks. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| is a different situation. We're going to pick up the debris at the street. It might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| take us a few weeks. We may be off schedule. We're off schedule right now. We're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| to be on our normal two-week rush schedule. We're going to reassess on Monday, see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| we do this weekend, and we may stay off schedule another couple of weeks. So if you will relay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| the information in this press release, we've tried to communicate with the public as best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| as possible. We've got this on the web. Dave Massey, through the Neighborhoods Group, sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| this same information out via the neighborhood link. Obviously, we're trying to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| with local media. So just get the word out. We're going to get it. Folks could be patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| That would be wonderful. I know traffic engineering, Mr. King, is here, and the stormwater folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| are also very busy with flooding calls and trying to get signals and signage back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| So we've got a prioritization and a list, and we're working off of it. And please communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| with your constituents. And I also have some recycling propaganda I'm going to leave with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| the recorder. And if you want to take this to meetings or hand out to neighborhood folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| that would be great. www.doyourpartwiththecart.com. And we're at 5,500 plus sign-ups since last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| week, which is great. And our goal is 20,000. So please get the word out to folks in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| neighborhoods. Thank you. Thank you, David. Councilman Woodhull, is that a year light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| or an old light? Councilman Della Vopi? Yeah, I just wanted to mention to Mr. Brace, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| you would remind folks to be careful about putting brush near the drains that go under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| driveways and stuff. We have seen in the recent flooding in the last several months in Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| City, for example, that when those drains get stopped up, water walks down roads and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| causes extra mess. And, of course, we're all going to have brush and we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| dragging it out, but we need to be mindful that those ditches mean something to the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| of the area. We'll do that. Thank you. Councilman Thomas? David, first of all, thanks a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| for the flexibility. And I know you guys are doing all you can to accommodate things. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| just had a question. If you could, what about just pure trees, parts of trees bigger than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| brush? No, that's fine. We're going to collect that. That's part of our yard waste program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| We have some diameter restrictions, but obviously with this incident, we're going to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| that. Our press release says if you can get it cut up into manageable pieces, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| be wonderful. Some pieces, if they're really big, we may have to bring out another piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| of equipment later to collect it. So we would just ask for patience. Some things might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| on the side of the road a couple of weeks until we can get a front end loader if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| really big or if it's a root ball. But, you know, get it cut up, get it to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| We understand that some tree services are going to be cutting debris up in the yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| so existing down debris that a commercial contractor cuts up and gets to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| we'll collect that. If someone has a tree that needs maintenance, like always, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| want folks to take an opportunity to put commercial waste up the street. But down trees and debris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| right now, get it to the street, we'll get it. Thank you. Thank you, David. Okay, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| wanted to go through for those of you that don't have an agenda what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| We're going to hear a presentation by Mark Donaldson with the MPC on the plan, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| we're going to hear from anyone that has, we're going to give equal time to anyone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| any presentation of an alternative plan or suggestions or what have you. Then we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| to have a public forum where we're going to have a sign-up sheet if anybody, we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| a sign-up sheet. Anyone that would like to speak will evaluate how many speakers we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| and then they'll lock the time up. And I don't know if they'll be, if we have a pro or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| or what have you sheet, but just to spread out the time, depending on how many we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:52| And then we'll have a council discussion. So I'd like to, if there's no opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| that council, we just listen to the presentations, take notes, put down questions, what have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| you, and when we're finished, we'll go back and go through those. If they're not covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| in the presentation, we'll be able to answer those. Councilman Holquist is here, and he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| at the podium. Would you like to say something? Vice Mayor, thank you. Vice Mayor, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| Councilmembers, thank you for scheduling this workshop, taking the time to hear about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| important issue, the plan that's put before you. I just wanted to say that to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| as the co-chair of this task force that's been working for three years now on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| You're going to hear the presentation from MPC, and I think hopefully it'll help clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| what it means to the city of Knoxville if this plan is adopted by this council, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| I would hope that you would do. And I will be here, so if you have any questions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| me as the task force co-chair, I'll be glad to answer them. Thank you. Thank you. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Donaldson, if you'd come forward, and we've had a presentation once before, so if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| could get to any sort of changes or how it's been tweaked, and maybe about a 20-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| presentation would be good. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. I just want to set the scene and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| review the path that's been taken to get to this point. As you recall, City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:22| County Commission created a joint city-county task force on ridge, slope, and hillside development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| and protection back in 2008. That task force worked for about two years and presented its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| plan, the hillside and ridgetop protection plan, to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| for their consideration in October of 2010. In December, the MPC amended the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:50| version and adopted its plan as an element of the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| 2033. And as a result of a change in state law back in 2008, with the adoption of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=538)|
| 0:09:10| amendment by the Planning Commission, it's not operative until the legislative body has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| approved it. So we are at that stage now. We are asking City Council to approve its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=556)|
| 0:09:25| portion of the plan, that portion of the plan that would apply within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| to make the Planning Commission's version of the plan operative. You also have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| under state law to initiate your own plan amendment should you get to that point. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| just to review the purpose of the plan, as indicated by the title of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| this is an issue-oriented plan with several purposes. One, to provide background material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| on issues related to ridge, slope, and hillside development and protection. To identify an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| area of the city and county in which those issues are prevalent. To consolidate into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| a single document the existing policies that are found elsewhere in other adopted plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| such as the Growth Policy Plan and elsewhere in the General Plan. And then finally to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| a road map for the consideration of recommendations with regard to addressing the issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| have been identified. With me tonight are Liz Albertson, Tim Kuhn, Mike Carberry, Buzz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| Johnson of our staff. Liz will just take a few minutes to review some of the principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| and recommendations from the plan. Tim will then get a little more technical, addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| a lot of the issues that have come up over the last six months or so, and trying to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| them in on that portion of the plan which is addressed, that applies within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| And then we'll be available for any questions that you may have later on. So first we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| go with Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Hi, thank you for letting us present to you tonight. My name is Liz Albertson and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=668)|
| 0:11:17| a Comprehensive Planner with the Metropolitan Planning Commission. I'm going to quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| go through these goals. You've probably seen them before at our last workshop. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| goals of the task force was to protect the health and safety of residents by avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| high-intensity or high-density hillside development. Another goal is restoration of our forested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| ridges for both environmental and economic benefits. Another goal is to foster compact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| development in our more level land areas, maintaining our scenic resources, and creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| green belts through bridge conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| We'll move quickly through the plans and principles, the plans, principles, and guidelines. An| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| overall principle, we see this reflected in hillside plans all across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| including those in Blount County, Sevier County, City of Gatlinburg. The overarching principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| is the steeper the slope, the lesser the housing density, and the steeper the slope, the lesser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| the land disturbance. Also, the task force recognizes the principle that the natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| beauty of our ridgetops is worthy of conserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| In regard to our residential density recommendations, these would only be applied at the time of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| rezoning. Our current practice looks at a recommended density of two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| per acre on slopes 15 to 25 percent. That's an existing recommendation that MPC uses when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:52| reviewing site plans. The 25 to 40 percent slope group, we look at one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| per two acres. Again, that's also existing currently with our plans. Our two new changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| are for 40 to 50 percent slopes, looking at one dwelling unit per four acres, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| looking at no development credit for slopes greater than 50 percent. Again, that's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| a new recommendation. These were coming out of what we heard in regard to concerns expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:31| by both our emergency management professionals that we consulted with and some of our engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| on the task force in developing in these slopes greater than 40 percent. We've also looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| at special districts, recognizing that under special circumstances, such as areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| are close in proximity to arterial, highways, freeways, and transit areas where infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| is already significant, we should allow for higher intensities of office and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| development. This photo you see here is the Brookview development off of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| It's a good example of this concept. The task force wanted to use mini-carrots rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| sticks as an approach to allow for more appropriate development in these areas. The first is reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| setbacks. Again, this is allowing reductions in setbacks so an individual doesn't have to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:32| BZA for a variance. They can apply or ask for a reduction in setbacks at their time of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| development process. Again, this reduces the overall disturbance that's required, allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| structures to be closer to the road. Also reducing our right-of-way and pavement widths for roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| We consulted with both city and county engineering professionals and they agreed that allowing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| reduction within our hillside areas would be appropriate and, again, would allow for less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| disturbance in the hillside area. Another incentive that we see currently used in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| and county's fastest growing office development area, the Tech Corridor, is a reduction in parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Currently, our parking standards are more suburban in nature. They were probably first implemented in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| the 1960s and haven't changed much since then, so allowing for a reduced number of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| for each development would, again, overall lessen the amount of disturbance that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| And one of the sort of most beneficial benefits is allowing a density bonus of up to 20% when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:50| conservation easement is placed across some of the steepest areas or some of the ridgetop areas and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| again, allowing public access. This could be particularly useful when making greenway or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| greenbelt connections, as you saw in the park plan that was recently adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| And now I'll turn it over to Tim Kuhn, our GIS manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| Hi, thanks. I'm Tim Kuhn, GIS manager at the Metropolitan Planning Commission. I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:27| try to focus in a little bit on the development process, some of the nuts and bolts of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| process, and give you, hopefully, a good understanding of what happens with plan adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| kind of leaving behind some of the recommendations that the plan makes and really focusing on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| is the impact of adopting this plan. We want to start by drawing a little bit of distinction here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| between a property right and a development right. Property rights are rights that are granted to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| through your zoning and through the land use plans that the city and county have. They include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| ability to own, use, service, and sell property. Those are very basic property rights that East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| Tennesseans prize. When you want to execute or utilize a property right, such as building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| building, you have to leave the realm of property rights and go into the realm of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And in this case, one of the first things you need to do is you need to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| do you have the correct zoning? If you do, you can construct a building under the building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| and the subdivision codes or applicable stormwater codes, for instance. If you don't, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| seek a rezoning. If that rezoning is approved, you can construct, you can do the use that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| were requesting. If it's not approved, you can't. So the point is that there's a difference. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| you want to develop your property, you do it under the development rights and that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| permission. Adopting this plan. So how would we affect property rights? If we could affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| property rights of owners by changing the uses that are allowed on that parcel by changing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| zoning. So this plan does not change the zoning of any parcels. It doesn't institute any overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| or anything of that nature. It doesn't limit uses within certain types of zones if you fall within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| the hillside area, for instance. So it doesn't say, well, you can't do a car lot if you're inside the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| hillside area. But you can do other uses allowed under a particular zone. So property rights from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| that aspect are unchanged. In terms of development rights, there are a couple changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| development process that occur with the adoption of this plan. But the plan does not change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| uses that are proposed for any particular parcel. So if it's proposed for LDR, if it's proposed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| commercial, after adoption of this plan, none of those base designations will change. The plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| doesn't also institute any changes to the existing ordinances or regulations that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| currently under the city's policies. So what will change? What will change is the types of zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| that are recommended if a piece of property falls within the hillside area. Plan zones will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| recommended. It will make a slight modification to the amount of density that is recommended by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| NBC staff and will include the ability to provide some recommendations that include the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| that are in the plan itself. The plan does not create any new zoning districts. It does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| institute any new staff reviews or new procedures. Everything that is recommended in this plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| done so under existing procedures and reviews that are currently in place. There are no new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| permits, no new fees are assessed, and there's no ordinance changes or new regulations that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| implemented. So now we're going to kind of dive into the residential development process a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| bit. And we are going to focus on residential from the standpoint that the lion's share of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| property inside the hillside and ridgetop protection area is already proposed for uses that are less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| intense like low-density residential and such. So about overall, 92% of the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| in the city is proposed for low-intensity uses. So that's why we're going to kind of focus in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| that. If you have a platted lot and the platted lot permits the use that you want and you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| to go get a permit to construct a building, this plan has no bearing on that process. It does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| impact that process whatsoever. The plan doesn't have any factor in it. If you do want to develop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| property such as put in a subdivision or something like that, the plan may have a process depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| on what zone you currently have in place. If you have A1, R1, R1A, R2, R3, R4, for instance, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:27| have any of those zones currently on a piece of property that you wish to develop, a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| is filed and is developed under the existing minimum subdivision regulations that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and the county have. With the adoption of this plan, that doesn't change. You use the exact same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| regulations that you currently do even if that property falls entirely within the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| protection area. Now if you have a plan zone which is RP1, RP2, RP3, or R1A and you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| multifamily, you have to submit a development plan under a use on review process. Same process is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| place after the adoption of this plan. The only thing that changes is that the policies that Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Albertson alluded to in her presentation can be used in the formation of non-binding recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| that are sent to the Metropolitan Planning Commission. If you don't have the zoning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| you need, you want to use a different zoning to develop a property, the process is unchanged as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| well. Applicant submits an application to the planning, to the MPC. The staff does a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| They formulate a recommendation and that recommendation is forwarded to the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Planning Commission who can approve, deny, modify, or condition the request. That request or that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| recommendation is then forwarded to this body to make, who has the same disposition options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| available. So you are still the ultimate authority in terms of setting the zoning. Now if a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| falls within the hillside and ridgetop protection area, two changes would occur to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| First is the types of zones that would be recommended. And we'll be recommending planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| zones, planned commercial and planned residential RPs. So when do we recommend planned zones? Ideally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:10| we'd be using the existing slope protection areas that are within the adopted sector plans of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| city and county. And currently those cover 10.9% of the city's area. They're shown in gray here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| There are several methods by which those slope protection areas have been delineated. Some are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:29| more effective than others. We're going to focus in on this screen. It's yellow but hopefully on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| your screen it's green. Three sectors for a moment. South City, East City, Central City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:42| South City. So the process by which the slope protection areas were delineated in those sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| was done by hand. It's kind of an artful exercise wherein a technician held up an index card and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| tried to count the number of contour lines inside a 3 16th inch mark on an index card. And if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| are more than five, that represents 15% slope. So that process was done back in the mid-90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| And on this map it's a little bit difficult to see. I've circled two areas. One in the top right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| hand corner is an area where some slope delineation was done. In the bottom is Holston Hills where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| there was no slope delineation done. Now if we look at good slope data, KGIS slope data that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| have available to us, we can see how effective that process actually was. The northern part got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| some of it but it missed most of it and in fact included areas that don't have any slope at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| The southern part, totally absent of any sort of slope protection area even though it's along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Skyline Drive and Holston Hills there's quite extensive ridge and slope. So how effective were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| those things overall? They only capture 34% of the slopes over 15%. So we know that we don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| very accurate tool to make assessments of where there is significant slopes within the city. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| we have a model, a new model that we think can improve the method by which we do that. Now some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| of our sectors were delineated using GIS and they use a 15% slope as a basis for making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| delineation. And then they use something that's called a slope group and those are two acres of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| slope exceeding 15% that are contiguous. So that's our slope protection areas. The major drawback of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:22| that is that it does not include the ridgetops. So the ridgetops are left uncovered through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| model. So with our new model, we looked at models from all over the country but we ultimately came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| back to one that was very similar to the one that we started with and that is we start with 15% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| and then we make the slope groups a little bit less restrictive. So they have to be essentially a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| larger feature in order for them to be included inside the slope protection area. So they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| to be three acres and actually have to gain elevation so we're not just getting like a river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| bank or something like that. We're trying to get features that are actually going up. So they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| to be three acres and gain 60 feet or five acres and gain 40 feet. And then what we did to close in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| the ridgetops, which is part of our direction, was to apply a function called watershed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| covers the tops of the ridges. I'll show you what that looks like. So this map shows an area along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Black Oak Ridge in North Knoxville. The areas that are red are contiguous areas of slope that exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| 15%. So this is the start of the slope groups. Now the areas that are magenta are the ones that meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| the size threshold and the elevation gain threshold. So you'll see that there's some areas that are red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| that are still showing up as red. So those areas are going to be tossed out and we're only going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| include the larger, more significant features in the next step of the model, which is called the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| watershed, which is to define all the areas that are uphill from those slope groups. The inverse would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| be to say, what are all the areas that flow to the slope groups? Where do you have water literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| flowing over very steep pieces of land or relatively steep pieces of land? That's the basis for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| model. Citywide, we're increasing coverage from 11% to 23.7% with the adoption of the plan. Now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| may seem like a big jump, but there are some areas of the city where we really didn't have any slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| protection defined at all. Now in areas where we did have good slope protection areas defined, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| got one highlighted in the red area in the bottom, two sectors where we're using the same elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| data and using GIS, the result from going to our new model from the old model is an increase of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| about 6% in land area. So a net increase in those two sectors of about 300 acres. So it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| significant jump from the standpoint of when you make comparisons with comparable data. So back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| the rezoning process. The second change to this is how we recommend dwelling unit density. So here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:49| how we're doing it currently. We're just going to use an example of a hundred acre parcel. That parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| has several different slope classes. It's broken down into three different slope classes. You saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| the current framework that's recognized through the general plan and growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Just a second here. Mr. Vice Mayor, I apologize for asking this, but I thought the part he just went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| over was sort of crucial to understanding this thing. I'm afraid that I didn't capture all of it. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| idea of how we select the slope and you layered that on that North Knoxville Black Ridge, Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| area. Would you go over what this model does again, if you don't mind? I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| No problem. Does this count against my time? I was in the red somewhere, but I wasn't sure where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| Let's start with this one. The first is 15% slopes. 15% slopes is the basis for the delineation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| model. We use three contiguous acres of slope exceeding 15% that gain at least 60 feet in elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:54| They're at least 60 feet tall and it is three contiguous acres is the first set of slope groups we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| using. The second set are those slope groups that gain at least 40 feet of elevation, but are at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| five contiguous acres of slope exceeding 15%. Then it's everything that is uphill from those two slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| groups. The red is all the areas where slope, contiguous areas of slope that exceed 15%. Magenta are slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:26| groups that meet the size requirements. They are larger than three acres and exceed 60 feet in elevation gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| or they're larger than five acres and they have 40 feet of elevation. Are you saying you're cutting some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| them out now by doing that? We're going to cut out the red ones. We're going to drop the red ones out. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| only going to leave in the ones that are magenta for the next step in the model, which is to run the watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| function or ask what's uphill of those slope groups. So that is the basis for the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:57| Sometimes hitting someone with a two-by-four may be more effective, but I think I'm following gravity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| Okay, so we're back to the example on the dwelling unit recommendation. So the way we do this is this is a process we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1746)|
| 0:29:19| been doing since approximately 2003-ish, 2004 when we had good elevation data available to us. So we break the parcel down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| or the development site into its slope categories. Zero to 15% in this sample parcel is 50 acres, 50% of that site. So you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:37| that times the compatible zoning. So this number can vary, this first class zero to 15% slope. It won't exceed six dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:47| per acre in the city. Take that 50 acres times three. It's more or less a credit system. 150 dwelling units. The second class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| 15 to 25% slopes in this sample site is 25 acres times two dwelling units per acre is the policy, another 50 dwelling units. And you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| the same thing with the 25 and above slopes. So you add up the dwelling units, 150 plus 50 plus 12.5, you get 212.5 total units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:16| recommended for this site, divided by 100 acres, that's 2.12 dwelling units per acre. So that becomes the basis for the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| recommendation that's sent to MPC. And they can modify that if necessary and forward it on to you for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| Can you do that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| Yes. We are proposing a slight change, as Ms. Albertson alluded to, and that is including two new slope classes, 40 to 50% slope and 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:41| and above. The change at 40 to 50%, the change is that we're going to go from 0.5 dwelling units to 0.25 dwelling units in our credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| system. And at 50% and above, no dwelling units. So that's the extent of the change to our recommendation on dwelling unit density. No change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1849)|
| 0:31:00| is below 40%, though. So anything below 40% is unchanged. It's the way we've done it since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| So here's a sample site just to show you real world what this math yields. This is not in the city. It's along Ruggles Ferry Pike, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1866)|
| 0:31:16| about a 190 acre site. About 87 of those acres are in the hillside and ridgetop protection area. The process that we, our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| procedure, which uses the three slope classes, would yield a dwelling unit density of 2.22 dwelling units per acre and 423 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| Under our new procedure, we would actually provide, recommend a higher density, 2.32 dwelling units per acre and 442 units would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:43| proposal. The reason for that is because we have a scientifically defined objective process for delineating our slope protection areas across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:54| the entire city, it's uniform, we can limit our slope analysis to just the slope portions of the site that are significant, just the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| inside the hillside and ridgetop protection area. The old procedure, we had to do it for the whole parcel. That's why we're getting more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| dwelling unit density under the new procedure. Now, I'm not going to go through these. I left a copy of this for you up there. This is also posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:18| online. We've got other samples where we're going to show that dwelling unit density recommendations will not always be higher. In some cases, they'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| be lower, but they're only lower by about a unit or two units. I'm not talking one or two units per acre. I'm talking a total of one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| units lower than they are currently. In some cases, like the one I just showed you, they are higher. It is not a significant reduction. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| certainly not a prohibition of development inside these areas. That would be a mischaracterization of this plan. Another thing that's come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| quite frequently is this question of could things have been built? So the various landmarks around the county have been pointed out as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| things which perhaps couldn't be built once this plan was adopted. In most cases, in almost all cases, yes, something could be built. In some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| cases, for instance, some of our most prized residential developments could have even achieved more density. So Sequoia Hills and Holston Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| is often pointed out as one that couldn't be built under this plan. It'd be incorrect to state that. In fact, the dwelling unit density that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| we would be recommending as staff would be 112 more parcels than was platted in Sequoia Hills and 327 more parcels than were platted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:24| Holston Hills. So it's not a prohibition and more density can be achieved in some cases. The other question that may be a better question to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:34| is what can't be built under the existing regulations that we have in place? The ones I just named are the ones that can't be built under our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| existing regulations. Because we have large right-of-ways, 50 feet of right-of-way and 26 feet of roadway, we can't do the skinny roads, the 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:53| 19, 20 foot roads that are inside Sequoia Hills and Holston Hills. We can't have the variable setbacks. We can't have these alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| development standards, which is really what this plan is about, is trying to get to the point where we can have reduced road width right-of-ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| reduced road widths, flexible setbacks, clustering options, bonuses to cluster outside of the hillside area. You can still go in it if you want and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| encouraging a mix of housing types. So that's the extent of what I have. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| Let me ask counsel, do you want to proceed with questions for the presentation or do you want to hear the alternative plans in the public as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:32| and take in all that information and then come back with specific questions? Okay. Anybody want to hear questions now or do you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:43| I want to hear some on the technical pieces of this because I'm trying to understand the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Help us understand the comments from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| Okay. Well, then let's proceed with questions on the plan. Counsel Mandela-Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Yeah. Tim, if you would drag yourself back up here, you walked too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| You gave an example of Sequoia, Holston Hills, and a third entity that might not actually have the same density as this plan would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:18| given its features of reduced setbacks, skinnier roads, whatever, maybe concentrating development in the flatter areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:27| I guess the question is twofold. One is, under this plan, would you be able to build on the ridges themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| where there are some houses, for example, in Holston Hills that are on the ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| Now, the lots are fairly big, so they remain essentially wooded, at least get that visibility of a wooded hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| You can throw it to me, Mr. Garber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Yes, there's a provision in the plan where you can build on ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| We have ridges of various shapes, some of them what we call knife-edge ridges like McAnally Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2156)|
| 0:36:05| Black Oak Ridge is very steep on one side and just climbs gradually up through Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| There's houses all along the top of Black Oak Ridge, and that would be allowed under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| The second question is, how did we get subdivisions like Sequoia and Holston Hills and Black Oak Ridge in the 20s and 30s without these regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:32| In other words, how was it that whatever standards we had in private enterprises, ingenuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| could build compatible subdivisions with the slopes in the absence of these more sophisticated standards, mapping, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:50| I think it's a twofold answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Holston Hills is a – I mean, Sequoia Hills was really the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| and it's just a great example of a trend that occurred in American community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| starting with Riverside, Illinois and Ainslie Park and down in Atlanta and Myers Park and Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| And there was a lot of developers across the country that were marketing that product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| I think one of the interesting things about Sequoia Hills, it has a little neighborhood center that has a mix of houses as far as apartments and townhouses, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:24| But I think the biggest – the second reason is that the grading equipment and the capabilities of that were so lacking back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:33| that the developer designed with nature, if you will, and fit the houses to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| You're saying we've gotten more powerful equipment so we can do more damage? Is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| Well, to some degree, yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| But you can wedge houses within forested settings, and those neighborhoods that we just discussed are good examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:59| As staff, we looked across two days ago the whole landscape of the city, and where there are steeper slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| they've generally not been as fully developed as the areas that were flat where the grids are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:14| But then when the slopes began to climb, you see a definite change in lot size and lot pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| of how development happened from the 1920s through the post-World Era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| All right. Mike, since you got the microphone, if we're talking about 63,000 acres or whatever number I've seen passed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:37| in some of the literature that could be affected theoretically by these regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| in the city, how many acres are we talking about in comparison to the overall county snapshot that you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| I guess Tim's got that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Because the city's a lot more developed than the county, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and so we have fewer areas that are, I guess, what, untrammeled, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| Just in terms of the parcel count, countywide, 62,000 parcels is accurate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| Within the city, there are 19,574 parcels that have some interaction with the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| Doesn't have to be much. It could be just an eyelash on a gnat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| I mean, if it touches it, we included it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| So 19,574 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| It's important to remember, though, that this is a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| This has to be – the hillside and ridgetop protection plan comes into play when you are rezoning or when you're doing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| And 81.2 percent of those parcels, or about 15,900 of those parcels, are either platted and vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| or are existing single-family residences that would have no interaction with this plan in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| whether it be putting in a swimming pool or cutting down a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| All right. In simple English, you're saying a third of the parcels are in the city, 19 versus 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| but of the third, you're saying 80 percent of them are already platted or developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| or somehow outside of the protection zone that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Not outside of the protection zone, but they really don't have, would you say, a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| The applicability, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Yeah, they don't have a development right outside of their existing single – or a single-family home in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| All right. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Counsel, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Okay. We'll move to the alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| And I know Mike Edwards with the Chamber is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| If you'd like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| And I see Mr. Davis is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I didn't know if he was going to represent an alternative plan or if there are any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| We have four speakers for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| So go ahead, Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| I need to wear my coat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| My name is Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| I'm going to read this because I'm going to – I want to – I know this is going in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| I want to try to get all the points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| The Knoxville Chamber supports responsible development in the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| including appropriate regulation of regulatory environments of environmental and sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| It agrees with the goals expressed by the city-county task force on rich slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| and hillside development and protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| but it does not agree with MPC's proposal on how to accomplish those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| These are the two fundamental differences between MPC's position and the Chamber's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| First, the amendment of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| MPC recommends adoption of a 78-page amendment to the general plan that sets forth general policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:57| and recommended practices to be followed by review and amendment of codes and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:07| It says the primary means of implementing the plan would be to rezone affected areas to plan zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:17| that requires use on review approval from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| MPC acknowledges in its reports that most of these concepts are already addressed in existing plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| including urban growth plan, the general plan, the sector plans, the city-county tree conservation planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:41| These, by the way, exist in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| The primary means of implementing is on page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| Residential plan is on page 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| Office on page 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Commercial required on 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| So there is changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| MPC is asking you to make this proposed amendment to make it, quote, operative, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:17| The Chamber's position is that we don't need more generalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| Instead of adopting yet another plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| the Chamber recommends that the county commission and the city council review existing zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:32| building codes, subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and adopt detailed amendments to those codes and regulations as needed to protect steeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:47| The code provision should be sufficiently detailed that a property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| or a potential purchaser can review the codes and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| and determine what can be done with that particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| If you adopt the plan, you are effectively endorsing MPC's plan to recommend rezoning tens of thousands of acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:14| to planned zones, giving MPC largely subjective use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| and review authority over any proposed construction or development in these areas or those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| The Chamber opposes the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Under the Chamber's proposal, property owners could read the codes and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| determine what they could do with their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| and then submit appropriate applications for the grading and building permits to the city codes department as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:47| Projects in protected areas would have to comply with the enhanced zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| building codes, and subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Enforcement would continue to be through the codes department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| without lengthy, costly, subjective review processes at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| and without an additional expense to local governments those processes would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| Regarding the scope of protected areas, the MPC plan recommends that 131,000 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:26| or 39 percent of Knox County be declared to be a specially protected hillside in ridgetop areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:38| That includes virtually every parcel in the city of Knoxville and Knox County with a slope of 15 percent or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:47| and another 38,000 acres with less than 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| If you're contiguous to a slope and you're part of an acreage mass, you will be calculated in that formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2754)|
| 0:46:06| Property within the area would be subject to special regulations and special review processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| but property owners would not be told in advance that their specific parcels were being subjected to an operative plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:22| that recommends rezoning their property and imposing special restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| and limitations on the use and the development of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| so any building projects they may want to undertake to be subject to a discretionary review of the process at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:47| If this was to pass, the zoning doesn't automatically occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| In fact, if you're zoned residential, you're going to stay residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| And there's not going to be any change until you decide to go get a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| And at that time, you've triggered a guidance that, well, let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| The chamber believes MPC proposal goes too far and does not achieve the proper balance between the rights of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| and the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| MPC plan cites several developments that have had drainage and erosion problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:26| but the existing laws and regulations prohibit the practices that led to those problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| and the vast majority of property owners, contractors, and developers comply with those laws and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| Most areas of the city and the county have been adequately protected by existing regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| Most areas do not need special protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| and MPC should have identified those areas that truly have substantial environmental and visual impact on wide areas of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2870)|
| 0:48:01| Based on practices followed in other cities and foothill areas, the chamber recommends that enhanced regulations be directed toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:10| property with slopes in excess of 40 percent in areas of high elevation that visually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| and environmentally impact a wide area of the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| And the chamber estimates that this would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 acres or less than three percent of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| A task that I have included as a summary of the differences between the MPC proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| and the chamber's proposal has indicated we think the goals and the task force can be accomplished in a more efficient manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| that will protect the rights and the property owners and save property owners in the city and county the expense of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:58| and review processes proposed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| As indicated, the chamber recommends that detailed amendments to the zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| building codes, and subdivision regulations be considered for areas above designated elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:17| with slopes in excess of 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| A ridgetop overlay zone might be considered for the very highest areas in the most visual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| and environmental impact, but any such overlay should only apply to truly significant ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| and no overlay should be imposed without notice to the property owner and the opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| The existing protection and regulations should remain in place for slopes in the 15 to 40 percent range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:55| You have them already on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| You've been enforcing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| The big change between a building on a 15 percent slope today and under this plan is that under today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:12| you would pick up a piece of paper or the code is in review and if you wanted to add a room on the back of your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:20| you could read it or have someone read it for you and you would have a reasonable idea of what you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| Fifteen percent, 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| If it goes to plan development, you've added a subjective level in there that is simply not needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:41| on a broad brush area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And one of the things when we were looking at Midway, Midway is a very complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| obviously it was going to have on-site wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| There's going to be a major power plant there and it's going to have a lot of business and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| That made a compelling argument for a planned commercial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| If you're going to do a large or if you're going to do a significant residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| that's a compelling reason to have a planned residential site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| But to say that it needs to be enforced by plan development for 130 acres without knowing whether it's someone's backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:27| or it's going to be a business park is too broad a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| The preface of the MPC report says that the joint city-county task force is willing to work with MPC, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| and the county staff for a second phase of their work, including the drafting, review, the refinement of new codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| standards, and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| We are urging that the city and the county to move directly to the phase without adding 78 more pages to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3112)|
| 0:52:02| We urge city council to vote against the MPC proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| and to request instead that council's attorney prepare a resolution for consideration asking city codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:14| and engineering departments and MPC to review specific provisions of existing codes regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| to make recommendations for any amendments needed to improve enforcement in existing regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:30| to protect steeply sloped areas, higher elevations that have truly environmental sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:43| Thank you, Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Mr. Edwards, before you leave, I was intrigued by one piece of your discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| which was to identify the truly significant ridgetops and areas that needed protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3172)|
| 0:53:01| or deserved maybe more stringent protection than other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| How did you arrive at the 10,000 acres or how would we arrive at selecting those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| In other words, is there an objective process to pick those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Have you selected them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| How did we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Anything over 40 percent grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| So much of this property is at 15 to 40 percent according to our calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:32| In 15 to 40 percent, you already have ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| You already have regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Stormwater regs actually apply from the ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| You already have it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| We're already enforcing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| What reduces it down to a smaller more area is starting at 40 percent and going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:59| We believe that 40 percent going up looks pretty weak in the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| We believe that there needs to be some fairly significant language for ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| and that needs to be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| It needs to be worked out with staff and a number of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| and it needs to be agreed to by the elected bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| We believe that the county needs to follow your action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| and develop a legitimate re-foliage, re-planting, re-forestation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| We don't believe that we need 133,000 acres simply in plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:46| And we don't, you know, amending the general plan is a very powerful step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| It is not a suggestive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| Sector plans can be viewed as a very sector without the force that state really puts on a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:14| But if you amend with the language that is in this plan, you amend the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| and that's really what you're being asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| You have introduced the opportunity with great force that this is going to be a plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:34| ridgetop slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Mike, I guess the follow-up question is, and you've just alluded to it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| this idea that you stated at the outset was your concern was that someone couldn't go out and buy a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| and look at existing easy-to-read, or maybe not easy-to-read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| but a defined body of regulations and know what they can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| And if it's all planned special treated property, then they're not sure whether it's developable or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| and they don't know whether they can invest or not without actually going through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| Would you, is that, am I characterizing that fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| that your concern is going to impact decisions on whether someone even buys or sells a tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| because they won't know exactly what applies to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| You can, you will know if it's zoned residential that you can put a residential unit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| Or if you're on a, if you're within this plan and you want to expand your house or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:42| but today you can go to the codes and the regs and read and know what you can do and you cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:54| While you can, under plan development, while you have a reasonable idea of what you can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| you still have to get an opinion rendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| And if you're looking at a piece of property or you own a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| you should not have that uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| You should be able to have some degree that it doesn't necessarily have to be a house that is erected on stilts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:22| in order for you to be able to use that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| Certainly we found a solution and you can get a house there, but it's, I really wanted a rancher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:36| That's the point, is that in commercial, really gets to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| commercial probably has more times that it can be planned commercial than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| But to say that commercial must be planned development, it's, or office, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| if you're talking about a simple office building, it doesn't really need to have that type of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3480)|
| 0:58:11| and actually time delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| It will kill deals because people, any time a developer, and if it's a commercial deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| a tenant and they're ready to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| And if you're spending time trying to get permitted and waiting for things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| and you can't say, look, I've got this thing tied up, I've optioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| and now I'm getting into my 18th month, you're going to lose your tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| So they're going to go to another site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Plan development is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| It should be used, but it's not a broad brush tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Mike, has the Chamber sat down with the task force or MPC and gone over this comparison list that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| in terms of where your differences are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Right now we have been traveling through the MPC presenting these to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:23| We've been discussing also with the city and the county where we have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| When you look at those differences, they're really, you know, we're not saying cut out 10 to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:42| We're not saying do not eliminate onerous development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| We're simply saying put it in the form of ordinances and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| so that people really understand what is going to be allowed and not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| But if you look at our side-by-side comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| we're not advocating anything that was not part of the original goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| and intent as stated by the city, the county, or the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Yes, Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| This task force worked for, I think, three years to develop this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| After they completed their work, they brought it to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| There were a number of public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I know I attended one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| There was a great deal of publicity about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Where was the Chamber and others who were concerned about what has now come to a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| where was the Chamber during that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| We did not participate in the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| When we looked, we read the document when it was approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3654)|
| 1:01:04| And the truth is it really took a lot of different changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:13| and different shifts one way or the other, even after it got to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| So as a citizen organization, we wanted to see what was going to come out, look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:31| and then, as again, we fully agreed with the intent and the purpose of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| It wasn't really until we saw the plan development piece and the amendment of the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| that we really started to look at something that is like 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| and then you add that piece into it that we started to say, well, wait, that's a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3711)|
| 1:02:01| We looked at it when most citizens looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| So you were not aware or interested in the public hearings that took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| during the process of the creation of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| We had a number of conversations with a number of people who were serving on the task force and on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| The conversations would happen about weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| And what was going on from one week to the next was totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| The alarm button would hit on one week and don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| I think that's all gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| That's going to be fixed the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| It was making sausage and there were plenty of people there to make the sausage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:52| Our role when we read this is to advise city council and county commission as to what our opinion is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3772)|
| 1:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part1?start=3782)|
