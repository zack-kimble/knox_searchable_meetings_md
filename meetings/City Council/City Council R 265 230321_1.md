| 2:28:07| one entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8887.0)|
| 2:28:08| Do you know where that rooted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8888.0)|
| 2:28:09| Is that maybe tied to the RN-5 versus the RN-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8889.0)|
| 2:28:13| I just noted in the packet there are three possible access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8893.0)|
| 2:28:18| So their property touches three different public streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8898.0)|
| 2:28:21| old Amherst, Francis, and Hembolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8901.0)|
| 2:28:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8904.0)|
| 2:28:25| Mr. Welch, the sector plan and the one-year plan are already low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8905.0)|
| 2:28:32| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8912.0)|
| 2:28:33| So we don't know when those were identified as low-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8913.0)|
| 2:28:37| I don't recall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8917.0)|
| 2:28:38| But I would say for quite some time since the sector plans have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8918.0)|
| 2:28:42| updated for at least five to seven years in most city sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8922.0)|
| 2:28:46| Talk about a problem you just identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8926.0)|
| 2:28:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8928.0)|
| 2:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8929.0)|
| 2:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8930.0)|
| 2:28:51| Council Member Sang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8931.0)|
| 2:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8932.0)|
| 2:28:56| Mr. Cannon and Mr. Brace, I think this question is for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8936.0)|
| 2:29:00| and you may need some time to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8940.0)|
| 2:29:05| We discussed different Bruin Road and that's an RN-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8945.0)|
| 2:29:11| but the roads that why can we not keep up with the roads as we keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8951.0)|
| 2:29:15| with housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8955.0)|
| 2:29:16| And which are the roads that we had these kind of discussions on and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8956.0)|
| 2:29:20| like, Hollywood Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8960.0)|
| 2:29:22| There was so much worry about traffic and accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8962.0)|
| 2:29:26| and how did that turn out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8966.0)|
| 2:29:27| If you have some examples of this, I would love to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8967.0)|
| 2:29:31| Well, I may kick it over to Mr. Clabo or Mr. Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8971.0)|
| 2:29:34| who are both engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8974.0)|
| 2:29:35| But I think when we look at roads, we look at data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8975.0)|
| 2:29:38| And I think Mr. Clabo discussed that previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8978.0)|
| 2:29:40| When we look at the data and we look at the road type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8980.0)|
| 2:29:45| that is part of the analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8985.0)|
| 2:29:48| And I think this road, Mr. Clabo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8988.0)|
| 2:29:49| you mentioned there have been about five accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8989.0)|
| 2:29:52| It was not outside the bell curve of what we would see for this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8992.0)|
| 2:29:56| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=8996.0)|
| 2:30:00| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9000.0)|
| 2:30:06| As far as keeping up, we're speaking specifically of roadway design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9006.0)|
| 2:30:11| or sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9011.0)|
| 2:30:12| What would you like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9012.0)|
| 2:30:14| More roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9014.0)|
| 2:30:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9015.0)|
| 2:30:19| You and I have experienced it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9019.0)|
| 2:30:21| Nickel is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9021.0)|
| 2:30:22| We've looked at many others that have been, I would call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9022.0)|
| 2:30:26| substandard for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9026.0)|
| 2:30:29| Many of the road projects we're able to tackle in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9029.0)|
| 2:30:32| we're able to tackle because of what I'll call TPO funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9032.0)|
| 2:30:37| which allows us to put in 20% of what the overall project costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9037.0)|
| 2:30:43| We're stretching that as far as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9043.0)|
| 2:30:47| And the TPO projects are geared towards more high-capacity roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9047.0)|
| 2:30:53| There's, candidly, it's just a limit of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9053.0)|
| 2:30:55| very similar to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9055.0)|
| 2:30:57| Mr. Bryce was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9057.0)|
| 2:30:59| There's $2 billion in identified sidewalk projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9059.0)|
| 2:31:03| And I dare say that that number is greater for the roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9063.0)|
| 2:31:08| widening the roadways in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9068.0)|
| 2:31:11| So the city, this council, chips at this as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9071.0)|
| 2:31:17| as funding, the revenues coming in, allow us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9077.0)|
| 2:31:22| It's just you can't keep up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9082.0)|
| 2:31:25| I'm going to ask him some questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9085.0)|
| 2:31:29| Mr. Sales, do you mind speaking to this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9089.0)|
| 2:31:33| I have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9093.0)|
| 2:31:41| So your name and who you work with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9101.0)|
| 2:31:47| Hanson Sale with the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9107.0)|
| 2:31:50| So I read you've been doing a lot of your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9110.0)|
| 2:31:53| there's been a lot of research done lately on what the housing situation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9113.0)|
| 2:31:58| and then you hear what the road situation is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9118.0)|
| 2:32:01| Can you talk a bit about what type of housing we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9121.0)|
| 2:32:05| and also address if this is not affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9125.0)|
| 2:32:09| but it is our end to housing, is that a need we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9129.0)|
| 2:32:13| Do you think that that would be helpful with some of the home prices and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9133.0)|
| 2:32:17| some of the rental prices that we're seeing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9137.0)|
| 2:32:20| Yeah, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9140.0)|
| 2:32:21| I'll speak theoretically because our association doesn't take positions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9141.0)|
| 2:32:25| particular properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9145.0)|
| 2:32:27| but to lay the land in 2021 to purchase the median priced home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9147.0)|
| 2:32:34| you needed around $56,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9154.0)|
| 2:32:37| In 2022, you needed more than $90,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9157.0)|
| 2:32:41| which is 20,000 more than the median income in the metro area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9161.0)|
| 2:32:46| Rents in the same situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9166.0)|
| 2:32:49| I think it's averaging around 1300 a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9169.0)|
| 2:32:52| It's $450 more expensive than it was pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9172.0)|
| 2:32:58| And I will just to the extent of what sort of housing we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9178.0)|
| 2:33:03| Number one, there's empirical evidence that if you build housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9183.0)|
| 2:33:07| it curbs cost increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9187.0)|
| 2:33:09| There is empirical evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9189.0)|
| 2:33:10| I can send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9190.0)|
| 2:33:12| The cities that have maintained relative affordability have built at a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9192.0)|
| 2:33:16| higher rate per capita than other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9196.0)|
| 2:33:19| And one of the other big mismatches in our housing stock right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9199.0)|
| 2:33:24| particularly the small affordability is not just a price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9204.0)|
| 2:33:28| It's also inherently related to size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9208.0)|
| 2:33:31| So there is not, by and large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9211.0)|
| 2:33:34| we are not building smaller units that tend to be missing middle duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9214.0)|
| 2:33:39| triplex, the full range of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9219.0)|
| 2:33:42| So that's a big part of the housing stock that's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9222.0)|
| 2:33:46| I mean, 60% of our home sales were below 250,000 a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9226.0)|
| 2:33:52| It's only about 10% today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9232.0)|
| 2:33:54| And that's in part because the only thing that we build is three-bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9234.0)|
| 2:33:58| two-bathroom homes that are predominant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9238.0)|
| 2:34:01| And that's really the only thing that's possible in R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9241.0)|
| 2:34:05| Council Member Singh, your time is expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9245.0)|
| 2:34:07| By and large, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9247.0)|
| 2:34:10| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9250.0)|
| 2:34:12| You can stay right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9252.0)|
| 2:34:13| I'd like for you to finish that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9253.0)|
| 2:34:16| I'd like to yield my time to Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9256.0)|
| 2:34:20| Yes, I mean, size is a really big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9260.0)|
| 2:34:23| I mean, affordability, again, is a price point, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9263.0)|
| 2:34:26| but what is inherently more affordable is smaller units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9266.0)|
| 2:34:29| and we don't have smaller units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9269.0)|
| 2:34:31| particularly that meets the needs of young professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9271.0)|
| 2:34:34| We have a growing, nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9274.0)|
| 2:34:37| the number of sole-person households have doubled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9277.0)|
| 2:34:41| and it's predominantly baby boomers who are living by themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9281.0)|
| 2:34:46| who otherwise can't afford a two-bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9286.0)|
| 2:34:49| or a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9289.0)|
| 2:34:51| So this concept of size is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9291.0)|
| 2:34:54| and the way that our zoning code is constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9294.0)|
| 2:34:57| the way that zoning codes across the country are constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9297.0)|
| 2:35:00| is that when we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9300.0)|
| 2:35:02| the larger lot incentivizes you to build a bigger house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9302.0)|
| 2:35:06| and that's just the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9306.0)|
| 2:35:09| It's always been that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9309.0)|
| 2:35:11| So this concept of size is really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9311.0)|
| 2:35:13| and the affordability conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9313.0)|
| 2:35:15| and I just will add, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9315.0)|
| 2:35:17| I mean, the conversations about housing more broadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9317.0)|
| 2:35:20| you know, our zoning system is constructed in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9320.0)|
| 2:35:23| that we make site-by-site, lot-by-lot decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9323.0)|
| 2:35:26| and no one ever thinks about the systemic housing needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9326.0)|
| 2:35:30| that we have as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9330.0)|
| 2:35:32| and so, you know, housing does have to go somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9332.0)|
| 2:35:35| so it's just worth keeping that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9335.0)|
| 2:35:38| that, you know, we have to bring larger context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9338.0)|
| 2:35:41| to a lot of these decisions, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9341.0)|
| 2:35:45| Councilmember Singh, you have additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9345.0)|
| 2:35:48| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9348.0)|

| 2:35:59| The conversations that we've had here I respect very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9359.0)|
| 2:36:02| because it's about safety and about the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9362.0)|
| 2:36:04| and about the flooding and stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9364.0)|
| 2:36:07| There were a lot of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9367.0)|
| 2:36:09| where people called me about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9369.0)|

| 2:36:16| and, you know, all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9376.0)|
| 2:36:19| I want you to discuss what type of housing projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9379.0)|

| 2:37:27| that's what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9447.0)|

| 2:37:37| The reason I ask is, you know, on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9457.0)|
| 2:37:39| we get to know developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9459.0)|
| 2:37:42| and we know the developers that will work with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9462.0)|
| 2:37:44| and the developers that won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9464.0)|
| 2:37:46| So I am asking, I'm making the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9466.0)|
| 2:37:49| as so many of my Council members did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9469.0)|
| 2:37:51| will these conversations continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9471.0)|
| 2:37:53| Will there be compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9473.0)|

| 2:38:09| and we met with the folks at Bruin Road several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9489.0)|
| 2:38:12| We're happy to meet and talk with anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9492.0)|
| 2:38:14| and anybody that has a reasonable proposal will be happy to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9494.0)|
| 2:38:17| We've worked with Knox County Engineering, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9497.0)|
| 2:38:20| on cost-sharing methods to make things safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9500.0)|
| 2:38:23| We've added guardrails on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9503.0)|
| 2:38:27| near the Farragut Point apartment complex out in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9507.0)|
| 2:38:30| We've split costs on stoplights on other developments in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9510.0)|
| 2:38:37| Because that is something that is important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9517.0)|
| 2:38:40| I'm going to close up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9520.0)|
| 2:38:43| I have lived in this neighborhood on and off since 1976,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9523.0)|
| 2:38:47| and this was before Westmere Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9527.0)|
| 2:38:53| before Creekhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9533.0)|
| 2:38:55| before all of these other complexes that are on off of Humboldt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9535.0)|
| 2:39:00| And each and every time, there's been fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9540.0)|
| 2:39:03| and I understand that fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9543.0)|
| 2:39:05| That road is a rural road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9545.0)|
| 2:39:07| But this is the same conversation that keeps going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9547.0)|

| 2:44:13| questionable situations by that they were acting within policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230321?start=9853.0)|
