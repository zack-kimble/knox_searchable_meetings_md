| 2:29:21| yesterday, and so I sent that out to all members of council this morning. It was probably late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8961)|
| 2:29:28| this morning. I sent it to your council email addresses, so. Okay. If you didn't get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| just let me know. I remember in the. I didn't get it. Okay, I can resend it. I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| in the previous meetings we had, I requested that of the Urban League and received it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8978)|
| 2:29:47| well, so that was some months ago. Thank you. That's all the questions I have. Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| McKenzie? Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank my colleagues for your comments and the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=8992)|
| 2:30:00| and dialogue that we've had around this. I want to make a couple of statements and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| share some with everyone. You can hear me briefly. I'll try not to breathe on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9005)|
| 2:30:13| Economic development in my community requires economic investment, and this project actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9013)|
| 2:30:23| provides that. The opportunity for people in my community who are living disproportionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| the majority at or below poverty level, this project could be the gateway to grow and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9030)|
| 2:30:38| generational wealth, and that is my desire, and it always has been, from this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| and any investment and development that comes into my community, that comes before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| and that we support. I want to share with you that this is a vision that has been shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| by many councilmembers who have sat in my seat as well as around this table. A former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| predecessor of mine who was a dear friend and church member, six district city councilmember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| Danny Mayfield, who unfortunately passed away from bone cancer when he was 32 years old in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| I want to share with you a letter that he wrote to county commission March 4th of 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| Dear members of the Knox County Commission, I wanted to attend your meeting today to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| my opinion on the site for the proposed baseball stadium for the Knoxville Smokies. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| due to a prior commitment on my part, I am unable to address you personally. Therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| I am writing this letter to you and request that you give it full consideration in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| deliberations on the best site for the future home of the Smokies. I urge you to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| the current site at Bill Meyer Stadium to build the new baseball facilities. Increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| baseball fan attendance can be achieved at this site with new and improved facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| and at the same time, the stadium will continue to be a stabilizing force for the area community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9120)|
| 2:32:06| If you do choose the current site, I pledge to support and push for additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9126)|
| 2:32:12| from the City of Knoxville. Resources from both city and county governments will ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| that the Knoxville Smokies has a new home that both the team and our community can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| proud of. Sincerely yours, Danny Mayfield, Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9141)|
| 2:32:29| I want to leave you with that, to know that his desire was to see economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9149)|
| 2:32:35| and how ironic is it that he saw that through sports, through the Knoxville Smokies. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9155)|
| 2:32:42| I don't even know if everyone who's involved with this, with the building of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| was even aware that this letter existed and what his position was during his time on city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9167)|
| 2:32:53| council. But I want to leave that with you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| Thank you. Council Member Thomas and Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9178)|
| 2:33:03| Thank you. I just wanted to briefly address the debate or discussion we've been having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9183)|
| 2:33:09| about cost overruns and the definition, et cetera, what the implications are. When we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9189)|
| 2:33:18| approved the agreement to issue the $65 million bonds, my belief was that that was the obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9198)|
| 2:33:29| that the city was willing to make. And I heard Mr. Boyd say that anything above that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9209)|
| 2:33:40| be taken care of by him. Let's put it that way. That was what I based my vote on. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9220)|
| 2:33:48| think I misunderstood. I'm a pretty good listener. And we can talk about the semantics and definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| of what a cost overrun is. But the figure that I based my approval on was the $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9234)|
| 2:34:04| And in my mind, anything beyond that is a cost overrun. I mean, we make and debate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9244)|
| 2:34:12| the definitions, like I said. But like Ms. Singh, I suppose, if I can take some liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9252)|
| 2:34:22| I went home that night thinking we were basically done and that we had given a generous support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9262)|
| 2:34:30| to this project, which the 6th District needs. But I will maintain my position that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9270)|
| 2:34:39| given hefty support to this project in a way that I feel comfortable with, that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9279)|
| 2:34:46| there's a payback on that. Anything beyond that needs to be taken care of by the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9286)|
| 2:34:53| And Mr. Boyd has been generous in some ways. But in my mind, if Mr. Boyd has $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9293)|
| 2:35:03| to loan, he has $20 million to contribute to a project that's directly connected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9303)|
| 2:35:17| his baseball franchise. And Mr. Boyd and some of his family also own some property in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| Old City. They will directly reap some of the benefits of the added profit from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9323)|
| 2:35:34| development. And, you know, I don't say that in an accusatory manner. I'm just saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| you know, so I just, I don't think I'm going to move off my position that anything past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9340)|
| 2:35:49| the agreement that we made is going to be, have to be taken up by the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| And there is the means and the ability and the resources and the connections. If the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9356)|
| 2:36:02| private sector really wants to help Knoxville, then they will take up that slack and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9362)|
| 2:36:08| it off the burden of the taxpayers. And it bothers me that we're expanding the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9368)|
| 2:36:17| district. I was comfortable with the TIF district that we had agreed to before. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9377)|
| 2:36:24| expanding this TIF district and giving the control of that just to the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9384)|
| 2:36:30| makes me wonder about how we're possibly limiting other entrepreneurial investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9390)|
| 2:36:39| in that expanded TIF district that we may be able to reap the profits of quicker. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9399)|
| 2:36:47| take the TIF money to pay off our investment, first the city has to get it, which I'm all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| for, and they pay us back. Then Mr. Boyd would have to get up to $20 million, if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| the figure. And not until both those were paid off would any of that money go into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| coffer of the city that we can use to provide services for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9427)|
| 2:37:16| So we're getting way down the road from the investment to an actual benefit. And those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9436)|
| 2:37:29| are my thoughts right now, and I will leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9449)|
| 2:37:34| Thank you. Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| Thank you, Mayor. I know we spent a lot of time talking about the cash outlay that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9456)|
| 2:37:46| Boyd has given to this project between the land, the added $6 million, the team's lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9466)|
| 2:37:56| agreement, not to mention roughly $12 million that he's given to schools and nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9476)|
| 2:38:05| and businesses, including Green Magnet Academy, Center City Programs, YWCA for housing capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9485)|
| 2:38:16| for women and domestic violence, all told on a very short itemized list is $78 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9496)|
| 2:38:25| he has infused and committed to the people, our children, and the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9505)|
| 2:38:33| And if that isn't a reflection of somebody who puts his money where his mouth is, I sincerely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9513)|
| 2:38:39| don't know what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| Saying we shouldn't be using tax dollars to fund a stadium, in my opinion, is short-sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9523)|
| 2:38:51| You want to look at Chattanooga, which is a place where we have suffered from comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| for decades. And people fought and screamed when the aquarium was built there, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| we can all agree that the transformation that happened to that city and to that waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9545)|
| 2:39:12| and now their council just approved an $80 million investment in a new stadium with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| state funding, no private investor, and because they've seen the magnitude of positive change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9558)|
| 2:39:26| a project like this can have, especially when a population of 25 to 45-year-olds has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9566)|
| 2:39:35| grown at twice the rate of Knoxville, which solidifies we're well behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9575)|
| 2:39:43| And that's a demographic that any city envies. We heard from it tonight from one of our gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9583)|
| 2:39:50| who spoke in favor of this project, who's here because of everything that Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| has to offer. And it's not just the talent, but it's the economic impact that that demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| produces. And speaking of economic impact, from a recent third-party analysis led by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9601)|
| 2:40:07| the chamber, the multi-use stadium will have an estimated $1.34 billion impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9607)|
| 2:40:15| At 1,100 jobs, not including hundreds if not thousands more construction jobs, all of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9615)|
| 2:40:22| remain local and build a workforce within and across our city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9622)|
| 2:40:29| When people say we need to spend these public funds in future years on resources that more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9629)|
| 2:40:34| directly help downtown and other parts of the city, the disconnect seems to be that if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| weren't for this project, there will be no new public funds because blight generates a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9641)|
| 2:40:48| lot of nothing. And you can't spend what you don't have. So that's the alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| What seems to be getting lost is that the funding structure of this project is such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| that our annual commitment to the gap funding, so that's what's left after the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9661)|
| 2:41:08| after the revenue that's generated, after the state funding, after the TIF district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9668)|
| 2:41:15| on this project is estimated to be $750,000. That is half of what it costs the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9675)|
| 2:41:24| Knoxville to keep up two public golf courses in this city. And here we sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9684)|
| 2:41:34| I reiterate, $90 million to $100 million investment with a potential return on investment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9694)|
| 2:41:40| nearly half a billion dollars. That's the importance of public-private partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9700)|
| 2:41:47| and what it takes to make cities thrive. How much more can we ask for an individual to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9707)|
| 2:41:55| Not to mention the risk he alone will assume. I find it remarkably embarrassing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9715)|
| 2:42:04| unfortunate, quite frankly, that we are making this decision so difficult and roadblocking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9724)|
| 2:42:10| what is without question a legacy decision for the future well-being and prosperity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9730)|
| 2:42:18| this city that we all call home. I would like to personally thank Mr. Boyd for your overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9738)|
| 2:42:28| generosity, for your unwavering love of this city. The rewards, I mean, if it weren't for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9748)|
| 2:42:43| Mr. Boyd, we wouldn't even be looking at the opportunities that we have in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9763)|
| 2:42:50| that would never be able to be replicated. The rewards are significant, they are long-lasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9770)|
| 2:42:56| and the biggest risk is not taking this risk at all and truly crippling our city by depriving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9776)|
| 2:43:04| it of economic growth, job opportunity, problem-solving social services that this revenue will generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9784)|
| 2:43:13| and the chance to bridge our city and heal a divide that has long existed for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9793)|
| 2:43:19| It is time to get off G and move to O. And with that said, I would like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9799)|
| 2:43:25| Okay. The motion's been made to call for the question. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9805)|
| 2:43:31| Second. Here, I already had my light on. May I go and then we call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9811)|
| 2:43:36| The motion's been made to call for the question. It's not debatable. We'll take a vote on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9816)|
| 2:43:42| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No. Okay, that sounds like it passed, but maybe we should do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9822)|
| 2:43:53| Roll call. Councilwoman Testerman? Yes. Councilman Thomas? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9833)|

| 2:44:27| Next item is, oh, not next item, I'm sorry, now we're voting on the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9867)|
| 2:44:34| which is to approve item 11C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9874)|
| 2:44:46| Is there any, oh, no, we can't have further discussion, I'm sorry. All those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| Any opposed? No. We can do, I guess we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9891)|
| 2:44:58| Councilwoman McKenzie? Yes. Councilwoman Parker? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Councilman Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9902)|

| 2:45:26| 11D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute the first amendment to the Interlocal Project Agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9926)|
| 2:45:32| with Knox County, Tennessee and the Swartz Authority of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9932)|
| 2:45:37| Move to approve. Second. Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| Councilmember Singh? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| So I'm going to make this question fit this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9946)|
| 2:45:51| So we are acting like if we don't approve these things, the stadium won't happen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9951)|
| 2:45:58| I thought what we were approving was the way to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9958)|
| 2:46:04| If this does not, this next vote does not go through and we do not build the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9964)|
| 2:46:11| what happens to the 14 million dollars the city has already spent in infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9971)|
| 2:46:19| Ms. Welch, I mean, those are investments we needed to make anyhow, but go ahead, Ms. Welch, can you expand on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9979)|
| 2:46:25| Yes, thanks, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| So we actually haven't invested 14 million dollars in public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| We need to in that area for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| So the administration proposed and council approved a capital budget which includes 7 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=9995)|
| 2:46:43| towards public infrastructure in that area, streets and plazas that will support this project and the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10003)|
| 2:46:53| And we have not at this point begun spending those dollars because we are continuing to go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10013)|
| 2:47:01| of making sure that we have the plans, the designs, the construction documents, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10021)|
| 2:47:07| We haven't spent any money on infrastructure there yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| We're preparing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| I mean, there are designs and plans that are moving forward, but in order to actually begin construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10031)|
| 2:47:19| we need to get those documents into the construction document phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| And then there's so many different details to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| There's so many different pieces and I know this is very complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| but I have another question about has Major League Baseball approved the deal to move yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10050)|
| 2:47:37| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| I would defer to Mr. Kirchhofer to answer that question, Mayor, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10060)|
| 2:47:53| The form of the lease has been approved by Major League Baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| and the application for a transfer is a formality that since the team is moving within its own existing home territory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10076)|
| 2:48:07| it's, again, just a formality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| So, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| That's correct, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10094)|
| 2:48:17| Council, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| There's people signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| I forgot that before I called on Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| There's three people signed up to speak in favor of 11D and three signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| First person in favor is Brandon Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| I don't know if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Then Katrin Latham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10115)|
| 2:48:38| If you wish to add, please come to the podium if you've said, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| And Cole Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| And then the people signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| The first person is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10131)|
| 2:48:58| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10138)|
| 2:48:59| I'm Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10139)|
| 2:49:00| I live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| So happy to be upstaged by having the video played earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| I was going to play that for you now, but I've got more time instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| So, in November of 2021, the City Council entered into an interlocal agreement related to the construction and financing of a multi-use sports entertainment stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10148)|
| 2:49:16| This resolution authorizes an amendment to the interlocal agreement setting the maximum true interest cost of sports authority bonds at 6% per annum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10156)|
| 2:49:26| I don't think anybody has mentioned this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| The original rate was 5% per annum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| A 1% increase over a 30-year term is millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10170)|
| 2:49:37| The amendment also adds a subsection establishing that neither the city nor county can approve a tax incentive with respect to any property located within the TIF district without first obtaining the consent of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10177)|
| 2:49:49| The district is much expanded from its original outlines and now includes some thriving businesses as well as more blighted areas, although coincidentally does not include Boyd's Jig and Reel, which I thought was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10189)|
| 2:50:01| So, the stadium is gobbling up tax revenues from already thriving old city areas and any new development in the expanded area that needs the help of the city now gets approved by an unelected sports authority under this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10201)|
| 2:50:15| Quote, the purpose of this addition to the agreement is to ensure that the TIF district fulfills the purpose of financing development of the multi-use stadium, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10215)|
| 2:50:27| So, we talked about highest and best uses earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| So, if any development in this area now has to serve the multi-use stadium, it may not be used for its highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10231)|
| 2:50:40| For instance, Caswell Park is adjacent to the area included in the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| Caswell Park would be great for a low-income housing development that might need a little bit of city tax money to help it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10244)|
| 2:50:51| But do you think the unelected sports authority will just shut down any development that's not luxury because that's not going to help pay back the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10251)|
| 2:50:59| That's certainly a choice they have after this vote that you're giving away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| So, I encourage you all to vote no, especially you, Vice Mayor Roberto, because you asked a lot of good questions last November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10263)|
| 2:51:10| You said folks had come to you worried about stadium overruns and you wanted to ensure to them that that wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10270)|
| 2:51:17| So, we've had a lot of discussion about the definition of overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| I won't go back into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10280)|
| 2:51:21| But I would ask you, do you think that the people asking you to make sure that there weren't cost overruns would think that this is a cost overrun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10281)|
| 2:51:30| Would they think that colloquially what's happening here is a cost overrun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| It's increasing the price we're willing to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| Or would they say, oh, no, the technical definition, we'll use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| What do you think the people were asking you about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10299)|
| 2:51:43| So, the council agenda for the past several months has been all about granting rezoning and tax breaks for housing development that we desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10303)|
| 2:51:51| This agenda item is about expanding the tax zone for the stadium so that it can lock out affordable development that we so much need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10311)|
| 2:52:00| So, yeah, there's been a lot of talk about how there's no tax being generated, no tax revenue being generated in that area today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10320)|
| 2:52:08| We're leaving out that we are leveraging our future when we say it's not generating revenue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10328)|
| 2:52:13| So, we're just going to assume it's never going to generate revenue in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| So, we can count all that as gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| That doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| Something else that's been said a couple of times is that Randy Boyd is the last person to get paid back for his loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| Randy Boyd is the first person that gets paid under this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| Like as soon as the money is approved, who gets it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| Gym development, RR Land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| They are the very first people to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| There's no way is he the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| We also mentioned that we have more opportunities to hold Boyd responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10356)|
| 2:52:42| Well, this is an opportunity to hold Boyd responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| You heard him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10364)|
| 2:52:45| He promised that he would take care of any cost excess, and here he is asking us for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| Sorry, I hate to retread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| It's just there's so many good points that have been made and so many bad ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| Oh, yeah, I just had a note here that said we're asking Randy Boyd to put his money where his mouth is, but he wants to put our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10376)|
| 2:53:05| He wants to put our money in his mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| I think that's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10389)|
| 2:53:11| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| The next person signed up to speak in opposition is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| Mr. Roach, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10396)|

| 2:53:32| Vote this thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| Because, as was pointed out in the discussion about the previous resolution, there's not been a lot of forthrightness in this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10415)|
| 2:53:48| There's been a lot of mischaracterization of what we're really dealing with and what's been happening in the past to get us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10428)|
| 2:53:56| I've been quietly observing this for the last 25 years or more, and it's affecting one community in particular, and that's East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10436)|
| 2:54:10| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10450)|
| 2:54:11| Councilwoman McKenzie, you know this, and I know you've been wanting to get this thing going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10451)|
| 2:54:18| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| We had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Tommy Smith, you and I had a conversation for over two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10464)|
| 2:54:28| You called me and asked my opinion, and I told you because you put it in the framework of, Rick, what if I told you that we were going to bring half a billion dollars and it was going to directly affect East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10468)|
| 2:54:44| I already knew what you were talking about because I pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10484)|
| 2:54:50| Talking about the baseball stadium, what that was going to be like, what that was really going to be like, who was going to benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| So we get information that the people who are going to benefit are the people who own, who own, not the people in East Knoxville who were not consulted consistently and across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10497)|
| 2:55:13| That's the truth of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10513)|
| 2:55:17| Never really consulted whether you all want to believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10517)|
| 2:55:24| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| The people who have been definitely negatively affected by this whole process, who have never been given any guarantees, I started hollering, literally hollering about what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10527)|
| 2:55:40| A community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| That's what we talked about for over an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| You said you were going to take that information and take it back to your people, the people who were supporting this whole baseball project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10545)|
| 2:55:54| I said not one brick should be laid on this project until we had a community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10554)|
| 2:56:03| I didn't care about the tips because I knew a tip was going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| The little bit that I know about a tip, this was the only way this bad boy was going to get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| So here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| So now we're talking about finding a way to shift cost burden away from the person and the people that should be carrying the burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10575)|
| 2:56:34| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| Is there no way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| There's already a million-dollar-a-year, 30-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| Come on, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| That's diddly squat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10604)|
| 2:56:45| In today's inflationary market, even stupid old me knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10605)|
| 2:56:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| We should have been doing things ethically and on the front end of this whole baseball stadium agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| The people of East Knoxville and the contiguous areas northeast, Park Ridge, no guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10622)|
| 2:57:11| There is no guarantee that the Magnolia Industrial and Business District is going to benefit from this because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10631)|
| 2:57:18| We haven't benefited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| We went through everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| We went through federal dollars and got nothing to show for it, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10640)|
| 2:57:27| We're talking potentially $100 million from that process, and we got nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10647)|
| 2:57:35| We got two dead zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| We got food deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| That's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| We've got people without jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| We've got gun zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| That's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| And you think you're going to get rid of the homeless situation contiguous to the baseball stadium area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| You haven't even wanted to talk about that and deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| So what makes you think we're going to sit up here and approve of shifting cost burdens away from Mr. Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10675)|
| 2:58:02| and his organization who own most of the properties in those areas and who collaborate with the other investors and developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10682)|
| 2:58:12| We can't even determine whether we're going to have a bus terminal in the area that's going to benefit the people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10692)|
| 2:58:20| destination city that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| The next person signed up to speak in opposition is Chris O'Keefe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| Mr. O'Keefe, come to the podium, please, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10708)|
| 2:58:37| Chris O'Keefe, 7424 Kilbridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10717)|
| 2:58:40| Good to see you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| Last time we were here, it was over the CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| We had a lot of talk on why we couldn't do a CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| One reason was minimum wage workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| The city didn't make it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10731)|
| 2:58:52| We couldn't really, four years from now, guarantee that they'd have $15 an hour four years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| But, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10738)|
| 2:58:59| But here we are in the talks where we passed it, what, three months later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| Where everyone got a raise here in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| At the same time, Glenn Jacobs, now, once again, I know this is the city and that's the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| but I was in his office for, what, a month before that talking about apprenticeships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10749)|
| 2:59:15| and state-certified apprenticeships, registered apprenticeships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| not just we're going to train people, give them two weeks training, send them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10758)|
| 2:59:23| Well, we said we had an Urban League agreement for them to carry that apprenticeship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10763)|
| 2:59:27| Well, glad you all sent it out this morning, yesterday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| No word about apprenticeship in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| Says we'll train people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| Talks about DBE contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| Doesn't talk about anything about actual apprenticeships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| And what's their training, three weeks, two weeks, one week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| That's state-certified or state-registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| These are the things we want in an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| These are the things we want in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| And now we're asking for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| Now you can say, well, that's overrun costs and that's what the definition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10792)|
| 2:59:57| It depends on what your definition of is is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| And you all are old enough to know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| I was a teen when that was in the courts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10802)|
| 3:00:07| And that's where we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| It's all about how you define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| And, Tommy, I like to tell you about construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| They won't know the final cost of this project tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| They're not going to know the final cost of it in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| It's a four-year, three-year, two-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| Things are going to change amongst that whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| We do projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10822)|
| 3:00:23| We do federal government projects right here in DOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Those are your federal money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| And, once again, those have an overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| Those always go over cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| They're always going back to Congress asking for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| Now, as a taxpayer, I'm kind of okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| My job is because I know that the people that are working those jobs are having health care, pension, good pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10838)|
| 3:00:43| I know where my tax dollars are going in the federal dollars there on those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10843)|
| 3:00:47| And here we are on this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| I live at 7424 Kilbridge Drive now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| I'm not just at 1000 Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| That's the business manager for the iron workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| I live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10856)|
| 3:00:57| I live here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10857)|
| 3:00:58| As a matter of fact, my kids were born here before I lived here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| But the best hospitals are in Knoxville, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| That's where I came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| But, at the same time, he doesn't live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| I heard that comment a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| Every county that surrounds here lives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| We all care about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| But, once again, what are we getting out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| What agreements are we getting out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| And, once again, on overrun costs, what is the final budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10877)|
| 3:01:21| When are we going to, two years from now, when all of a sudden they go for another bid on part of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| and they're asking for more money, they're going to be standing right here again asking for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10885)|
| 3:01:30| Where does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10890)|
| 3:01:33| And, once again, I hate how we want to have cake, eat it too, or let no one else have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10893)|
| 3:01:39| wherever that saying goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| But, literally, Randy Boyd is taking the risk by giving a $20 million loan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| He gets paid, and if we can't afford to pay him, he doesn't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| Then why are we building the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| We talked about how great this is going to bring to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| This is an opportunity, the best opportunity we ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| So, we're taking the risk, we're adding all this money, and we're going to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10918)|
| 3:02:03| But, at the same time, maybe he won't get his money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| He's going to get his money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| That's our hopes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| Are we going to be on the negative the whole time, or are we going to be on the positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| And, once again, I go back to the CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| I've got a minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| We can keep going and just saying we're just, as parents, if your kid said we're going to buy this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10939)|
| 3:02:25| and they got to buy it, and all of a sudden it's $50 more, and you're like, well, you better think that through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| You know, $100 was your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| Now it's $150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| Are you going to think it through as good parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| See the agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10956)|
| 3:02:37| See what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10957)|
| 3:02:38| See why is it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| And here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10959)|
| 3:02:40| We're just going to throw money at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10960)|
| 3:02:41| Give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10961)|
| 3:02:42| Give them all they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| No agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10963)|
| 3:02:44| We're not going to get anything out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10964)|
| 3:02:45| What are the workforce going to get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10965)|
| 3:02:48| What are the people, the citizens that are going to do this job get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10968)|
| 3:02:53| I see DBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| I don't see anything about apprenticeships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10974)|
| 3:02:57| I'm glad the city now has more minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| But why weren't we in talks with the county and the city together saying, hey, this project is two years away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10980)|
| 3:03:06| Why can't we work together and communicate together to make an agreement that makes sense for all of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10986)|
| 3:03:11| And instead it's the city wants this, the county wants this, they want this, labor wants this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10991)|
| 3:03:16| and another community group wants this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| No one is working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| And here we are once again making a decision when we don't even know the final budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11000)|
| 3:03:25| And we won't know the final budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| So can we do this in stages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| What stages do you need and what kind of money do you need it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| Stage one, stage two, stage three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| There's better ways of doing this than just having an open checkbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| Right now we have an open checkbook with no agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| That's not responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| You wouldn't want your kids budgeting their accounts that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11031)|
| 3:03:52| Council, that concludes people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11032)|
| 3:03:57| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11040)|
| 3:04:06| Let me just say I need to pull up my notes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11046)|
| 3:04:11| The first amendment to the interlocal project agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| I've already raised some of my concerns about this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11054)|
| 3:04:21| The first under the first section, section 1E, of the agreement is where the amendment is made to raise the interest cost from 5% per year to 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11061)|
| 3:04:40| Previously with the presentation of the prior financing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11080)|
| 3:04:52| we were presented with figures of what the annual debt service would be at a 5% or lower interest rate, and that's $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11092)|
| 3:05:02| We have not been presented with what an anticipated annual debt service would be at 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11102)|
| 3:05:10| And I'm assuming that since the interlocal agreement did not change the amount of the $65 million bonds, we're talking about 6% on $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11110)|
| 3:05:20| So that should be easily shared with the public and with the city council, again, before we even vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11120)|
| 3:05:29| that we know what the annual debt service is expected to be at 6% on $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11129)|
| 3:05:35| First, let me say before I move forward, does anybody have that number and would like to share it at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11135)|
| 3:05:44| Yes, Mayor, Council Member Parker, yes, we have estimates of what that number would be, and I'm happy to share those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11144)|
| 3:05:50| But not tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| No, I can share it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11152)|
| 3:05:53| Okay, let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| So we're looking at a likelihood, and I'll ask our finance director to pitch in here, too, if he wants to correct me on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11155)|
| 3:06:03| a likelihood of about a $750,000 a year debt service payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11163)|
| 3:06:10| That would be the gap between what is available from other funding sources, revenue sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11170)|
| 3:06:15| to pay the debt service on that bond issuance from the sports authority and what the city would be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11175)|
| 3:06:23| That amount would go down over time as revenue sources from the other financial package that we've put together continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11183)|
| 3:06:37| And so currently, at that $3.2 million that is split between the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11197)|
| 3:06:54| you're saying that the additional interest, one percentage point of interest increase would increase that $3.2 million by $750,000 total, or is that the split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11214)|
| 3:07:11| $750,000 a year is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11231)|
| 3:07:15| But again, that depends on several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11235)|
| 3:07:19| One, how the loan is structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11239)|
| 3:07:22| It depends on the actual interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| I mean, we're projecting kind of a worst-case scenario here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11246)|
| 3:07:31| We say take it up to 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| But also, like Ms. Welch was just saying, you know, assuming the stadium is a success, we have no reason to think it won't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11253)|
| 3:07:45| and we're getting all these other revenue sources in, then that goes down because we're only paying us and the county $750,000 per year each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11265)|
| 3:07:57| We're only paying the gap funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11277)|
| 3:08:00| As that gap decreases because other sources of revenue are doing well, then that payment would decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11280)|
| 3:08:10| It's rather speculative right now, but this is needed to get so they can move forward into some sort of a development agreement, be able to eventually go out to bid and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11290)|
| 3:08:23| But $750,000 per year is what the city and the county each are looking at paying right now, the gap funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11303)|
| 3:08:34| But again, that may decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| Now, the financing plan that was previously presented to us estimated cost to the city of around $240,000 a year plus another $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11316)|
| 3:08:51| maybe $25,000 initially for the capital improvements fund on an annual basis, and that increases each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11331)|
| 3:08:59| So are you saying $240,000 for the city plus the $25,000 plus half of the $750,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11339)|
| 3:09:08| I'm saying right now the estimate is, as Ms. Welch said, $750,000 for the city, $750,000 per year for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11348)|
| 3:09:20| And then once the stadium begins the first full year after the stadium comes into service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11360)|
| 3:09:29| we start putting into a capital improvements reserve fund, much like we do for any large facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11369)|
| 3:09:37| where in year two and three after it's built, $25,000 from each of us per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11377)|
| 3:09:45| Four and five, year four and five, $50,000 for each of us per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11385)|
| 3:09:51| And it goes up because the facility becomes older and you have to replace things in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11391)|
| 3:09:57| And that continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11397)|
| 3:09:58| Like I say, we do that for our facilities right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11398)|
| 3:10:02| That's a proper way to plan for it so you don't have these gigantic expenditure spikes as time goes along and things tear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11402)|
| 3:10:13| Because, I mean, we own it at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| And so I'm not sure if you create these financial reports for the stadium project or if they come from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11417)|
| 3:10:28| For the stadium what, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| No, frankly, that got a lot of that with some of it from our bond counsel, Mark Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11431)|
| 3:10:41| I know that Mr. Bentley knows about that and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| But, I mean, I keep my fingers on the pulse on that so that I know what we're looking at as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11445)|
| 3:10:54| And so at what point, you know, it seems like even if we are not able to get a full updated financing plan at this point for the total cost of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11454)|
| 3:11:10| we should at least be able to just talk about that annual debt service on that $65 million if we increase it to 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11470)|
| 3:11:20| At what point does the city plan to have that conversation with city council and give us a new schedule and identifying the revenue sources that will go towards paying on that $65 million annual debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11480)|
| 3:11:34| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11494)|
| 3:11:35| I think that's the conversation we're having right now, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11495)|
| 3:11:39| And, you know, as our finance director has indicated, the project continues to move forward and we won't go out for financing until probably January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11499)|
| 3:11:53| So we can't tell you exactly what the interest rate is going to be in January and exactly what this is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11513)|
| 3:12:03| But we continue to make estimates as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11523)|
| 3:12:09| It's quite stunning to me that we would be structuring our deals in this way and committing to pieces of a financing plan that we don't even understand the full ramifications of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11529)|
| 3:12:24| It's mind-blowing, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| And just absolutely unnecessary is the other part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11547)|
| 3:12:30| There's absolutely no reason why we should make these decisions tonight without additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11550)|
| 3:12:37| The only reason why we're doing this is to make the developer happy, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11557)|
| 3:12:42| There's absolutely no reason for us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11562)|
| 3:12:44| We're not doing our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| This is absolutely irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| I don't even know if I can call it governance at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| We're just helping millionaires get richer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11572)|
| 3:12:58| Okay, so for the second part of this amendment to the interlocal agreement, there's an amendment, section one, adding subsection F to the interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11578)|
| 3:13:14| And this is the section that we've discussed earlier that obligates the city and county to prohibit additional tax abatements or tax increments incentive or financing to be granted to any property located in the expanded Magnolia redevelopment plan area unless approved by the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11594)|
| 3:13:36| And indicates it's just a brief mention in this document that the incremental property tax revenues in the TIF district will be used by KCDC to secure debt incurred to assist with financing the cost of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11616)|
| 3:13:56| There's no language in here that clarifies who will be providing the additional financing for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11636)|
| 3:14:07| There are no parameters around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| There's no language that captures our expectations that KCDC is not going out, taking out a $20 million loan at a 6% interest rate, increasing the cost to the taxpayer of this apparent shortcoming in the budget that Randy Boyd verbally promised that he would cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11651)|
| 3:14:36| There are no parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11676)|
| 3:14:37| There's no guardrails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| There's no additional details that tell us exactly how KCDC will secure debt to assist with financing of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11679)|
| 3:14:52| Ms. Parker, you probably can't see, but two of your colleagues have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11692)|
| 3:14:56| And again, council's rule says five minutes until it's announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11696)|
| 3:15:00| Has it been five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11700)|
| 3:15:01| Can I get a timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| I have been timing it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| You want me to put the timer up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| If you're going to keep interrupting me, I would like a timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11707)|
| 3:15:10| It's been ten and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11710)|
| 3:15:12| I've seen other colleagues speak for an extremely long amount of time and not be interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11712)|
| 3:15:19| I can start keeping a timer for everybody if that's what council wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11722)|
| 3:15:23| I mean, I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11723)|
| 3:15:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| Timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11726)|

| 3:15:28| Time in the council, members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11728)|
| 3:15:29| I mean, I guess we can put that to a vote to council if you guys want me to do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| I make a motion that you time all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| I'll second it because it's in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11741)|
| 3:15:42| For this meeting, okay, any further discussion on that motion to time council members for this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11742)|
| 3:15:51| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11754)|
| 3:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11755)|

| 3:16:02| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| I'm going to abstain on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11767)|
| 3:16:08| Motion carries 7-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| Now, Ms. Parker, you've been on ten minutes, so I'm imposing the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11772)|
| 3:16:17| We'll start now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11777)|
| 3:16:18| Please put the clock up for the next person is Ms. Fugate, then we'll go to Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11782)|
| 3:16:23| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11783)|
| 3:16:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11784)|
| 3:16:25| I think we're still on me, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| Your colleagues approved the rule that said they wanted me to time it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11788)|
| 3:16:32| I didn't even finish my thought is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| You even give public forum speakers an opportunity to finish their thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11800)|
| 3:16:41| Feel free to finish your thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| You interrupted me in the middle of my comment and didn't even let me finish my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| I thought you were finished with your thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11807)|
| 3:16:48| So I will finish quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| Under this amendment of Section 1, adding subsection F, it states that KCDC is to secure debt to assist with financing of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11812)|
| 3:17:05| My questions in this section are why is there language in this interlocal agreement that obligates KCDC to secure debt to assist with the financing of the cost of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11825)|
| 3:17:20| but does not name Randy Boyd or our land or Boyd Sports as the entity required to provide the funds for the loan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11840)|
| 3:17:29| That's one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| Let me go ahead and ask my second question in case y'all want to try to run down the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11851)|
| 3:17:36| Second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| In my comments and concerns submitted in November 2021 regarding the original interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11858)|
| 3:17:48| part of my comments were that we had no language in this interlocal agreement and we are not party to the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11868)|
| 3:17:57| and we have no language in this interlocal agreement to hold Randy Boyd to the cost of the rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11877)|
| 3:18:04| If you'd read my long document in November, those are my comments then and it's my comments now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11884)|
| 3:18:12| I can't believe you're coming back to us with an interlocal agreement that now obligates KCDC to secure additional debt for this stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11892)|
| 3:18:21| but you're not even putting language in here that obligates Randy Boyd to either provide the loan or to provide the cost of the rents as he should have done in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11901)|
| 3:18:30| If we had signed an interlocal agreement in November with language in it holding Randy Boyd to covering the cost overruns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11910)|
| 3:18:38| and put a figure in that agreement of what the maximum price could be, we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11918)|
| 3:18:46| Ms. Parker, do you actually want someone to answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11926)|
| 3:18:49| No, I'm still talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| Once I'm ready to ask the question, I will ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| So if we had put language in the interlocal agreement that established a maximum price for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11936)|
| 3:19:07| and clarified that the developer was obligated to cover any cost overruns over that amount that we had named in that agreement, we would not be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11947)|
| 3:19:22| It is unfortunate, I'll use the language of Councilwoman Janet Testament, who's no longer with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11962)|
| 3:19:31| that I am embarrassed by how this process has been played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| I'm absolutely embarrassed by the work of this city administration in negotiating this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11976)|
| 3:19:46| It seems that you are negotiating on behalf of the developer and not on behalf of the citizens who have entrusted you to carry out your job on their behalf as leaders in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11986)|
| 3:19:58| It is shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| And so my questions, Mayor, under this section are, why is there not language in the interlocal agreement that holds Randy Boyd accountable to the obligation of providing a loan, at minimum, for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12000)|
| 3:20:23| And secondly, why does this agreement not clearly outline, whether we are talking about a $65 million contract or bonds or whether we are talking about an additional $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12023)|
| 3:20:37| why does this interlocal agreement, this amendment to this interlocal agreement not clearly lay out that Randy Boyd, our land, is responsible for cost overruns over the amount that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12037)|
| 3:20:55| whether we are talking about November or whether we are talking about the agenda item right before this, not above the amount that City Council has authorized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12055)|
| 3:21:04| Those are my two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12064)|
| 3:21:06| Mr. Mamentov, can you address those questions, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12066)|
| 3:21:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12073)|
| 3:21:14| This is not the right parties to the agreement to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12074)|
| 3:21:21| This is an agreement under the Sports Authority Act to support the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12081)|
| 3:21:27| And so the TIF terms will be spelt out very carefully, as we have done for probably 25 other tax increment financings in the redevelopment agreements and the TIF financing documents between KCDC and the lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12087)|
| 3:21:43| And in this case, the lender will likely and almost certainly be an affiliate of Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12103)|
| 3:21:48| If we had an independent lender, that would be great, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| But since no one would lend against an undetermined income stream like this, then that would be the likely lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12112)|
| 3:22:01| So we will have detailed documents setting forth those things, as we have in the many other TIFs that we have done throughout downtown and throughout to promote redevelopment in our city, in those documents, as you all have approved many, many times in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12121)|
| 3:22:16| So it's consistent with past practice of this body, of KCDC, and the interlocal agreement is not the appropriate place to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12136)|
| 3:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12146)|
| 3:22:27| KCDC is not even a party to that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| Thank you, Mr. Mamentov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12149)|
| 3:22:30| Was it Ms. Ryder or Ms. Fugate who had their light on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12150)|
| 3:22:33| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| Go ahead, Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12155)|
| 3:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12156)|
| 3:22:37| I just wanted to clarify that we are talking about approving a 1% increase in the maximum allowable rate we will allow for the bonds to be issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12157)|
| 3:22:51| and we've approved a bond issue of $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| One percent on $65 million is $650,000 more a year, the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12175)|
| 3:23:05| I think I did my math right, but it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12185)|
| 3:23:09| So all we're being asked to approve is because we are in a rising interest rate environment and rates are continuing to rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12189)|
| 3:23:21| we have to say we allow the bonds to pay a higher rate of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| Secondly, for the reason that the sports authority needs to have some ability about the tax increment finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12207)|
| 3:23:36| about the repayment structure, it's because we have to go into the private sector to raise bond funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12216)|
| 3:23:44| and they have to have a guaranteed source of repayment, and that's part of why this agreement has to be the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12224)|
| 3:23:52| Am I missing anything, Mr. Mamentov?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12232)|
| 3:23:56| No, and that was a good point, and it is responsive to Councilwoman Parker's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12236)|
| 3:24:03| One percent is $650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| You described it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12245)|
| 3:24:06| Right now, the true interest cost, which is essentially an average interest rate on the debt, is roughly 4.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12246)|
| 3:24:13| We're still under 5%, but we are about to embark on spending millions of dollars more on construction, design work, site work at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12253)|
| 3:24:23| and if we change the interest rate, if we didn't have some headroom to plan for next January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12263)|
| 3:24:30| it would be very disadvantageous for everyone if we did not have the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12270)|
| 3:24:34| and you pointed out roughly the downside risk by adding 1% is $650,000 a year initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12274)|
| 3:24:41| As you pay off principal, that will go down each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| But maximum, we're talking a total overall interest cost the first year of another $650,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12283)|
| 3:24:51| and we're doing it because we're in a rising rate environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| and we have to have room because we don't know what rate somebody will give us when we go to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12294)|
| 3:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12301)|
| 3:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12304)|
| 3:25:05| Council, it's my understanding of your rules that we'll keep the clock going five minutes per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12305)|
| 3:25:09| including the questions and the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12309)|
| 3:25:12| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12312)|
| 3:25:13| Mr. Mamentov, I'm going to ask you a question real quick, so run because we're on a clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12313)|
| 3:25:18| Why was it set 5% before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| It was set 5% before interest rates were true interest costs in the low 3.2, something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12321)|
| 3:25:28| so obviously with interest rates rising to where we are now, and I'll try to speak really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12328)|
| 3:25:33| they're much closer to 5%, so we set it based on market conditions at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12333)|
| 3:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12339)|
| 3:25:40| So many things have been brought up since this agenda item has come to light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| including some of the public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| We are actually voting on the interest rate because the interest rates have risen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12345)|
| 3:25:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12349)|
| 3:25:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12350)|
| 3:25:51| I just want to be really clear what we're voting on because you seem to be rehashing a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12356)|
| 3:25:57| Mr. Caldwell, I'll call on you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| I'd like to ask you a question super fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12359)|
| 3:26:02| There's folks that have to use the bathroom, and I know everyone's tired, so that's why we're being hasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12362)|
| 3:26:08| Did a county commission vote on this last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12371)|
| 3:26:12| Did they vote on the previous agenda item last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12372)|
| 3:26:16| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| How did they vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| Unanimously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12378)|
| 3:26:19| Did they have any speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12379)|
| 3:26:20| Did anyone come and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12380)|
| 3:26:22| Everything was done at the workshop the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12382)|
| 3:26:25| It was on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| Did anyone speak at the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| Ms. Ryder has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12389)|
| 3:26:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| She doesn't believe other people get a chance to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12392)|
| 3:26:34| Mr. Mametoff spoke at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| I'm saying do members of the public in opposition speak at county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12398)|
| 3:26:43| There was public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12403)|
| 3:26:44| I don't recall anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12404)|
| 3:26:46| No one spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| Okay, so it's just here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| Ms. Parker, Councilwoman Parker, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12409)|
| 3:26:52| Can I ask you about the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| You said you had 30 pages worth of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12414)|
| 3:26:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12417)|
| 3:26:58| Were you not afforded the opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| Did you not reach out to Ms. Welch to talk to her about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12420)|
| 3:27:03| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| I had more questions than could be answered in the last four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12425)|
| 3:27:11| Sorry, six days since our agenda was posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| Did you not know about this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12434)|
| 3:27:16| It was in the media prior to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12436)|
| 3:27:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12438)|
| 3:27:19| I'm not able to get details before it's posted on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12439)|
| 3:27:23| I did watch the county commission non-meeting, non-discussion on this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12443)|
| 3:27:30| and I did download the items from their agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12450)|
| 3:27:34| Did you not reach out to Ms. Welch and ask her for a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| What is the point of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| I'm just asking because you said you had 30 pages of questions tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12460)|
| 3:27:43| and I wanted to know if you had a chance to ask Ms. Welch prior to this meeting your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12463)|
| 3:27:48| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12468)|
| 3:27:49| I've reached out multiple times to Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| I also have other things to do other than this one agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12471)|
| 3:27:56| We have been given six days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| Councilman Thomas, did you have a chance to ask Ms. Welch questions prior to this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12480)|
| 3:28:07| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12487)|
| 3:28:08| Councilman Roberto, Vice Mayor Roberto, did you ask Ms. Welch questions prior to this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12488)|
| 3:28:12| Did you have a meeting with her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12492)|
| 3:28:14| I believe we had a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12494)|
| 3:28:17| Tom Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12497)|
| 3:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12500)|
| 3:28:21| Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12501)|
| 3:28:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12502)|
| 3:28:23| Fugate, did you have meetings with Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12505)|
| 3:28:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12506)|
| 3:28:27| Ms. Singh, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12509)|
| 3:28:30| Councilwoman Ryder, I find this really disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| Okay, well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12514)|
| 3:28:39| I find it performative to an audience is what I find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12519)|
| 3:28:44| I'm sorry if that bothers you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12524)|
| 3:28:46| We all have a chance to ask questions and get our questions answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12526)|
| 3:28:50| and the fact that it's made to look like we don't and that we're cut off at the knees is really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12530)|
| 3:28:56| Council, please do not disrupt the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12539)|
| 3:29:00| Vice Mayor Roberto, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12540)|
| 3:29:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12543)|
| 3:29:07| I am very concerned about cost overruns, and I just wanted to go through and review what we talked about in the last item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12547)|
| 3:29:17| agenda item, which is very similar to what we talked about back when this first came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12557)|
| 3:29:22| So there's two ways to address cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12562)|
| 3:29:26| One, you can have control over the terms of the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12566)|
| 3:29:31| Or two, you can have a guaranteed maximum price and protect against cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12571)|
| 3:29:38| I think that protecting against cost overruns, especially in the environment we are in now, makes the most sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12578)|
| 3:29:47| and that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| We can't do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| You can't say we're going to control this and we want you to guarantee to pay above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12591)|
| 3:29:57| Now, in the earlier questions we had with Mr. Mametoff earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12597)|
| 3:30:03| I asked him what triggers that guarantee for Mr. Boyd to cover cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12603)|
| 3:30:09| His answer was, you need a development agreement that is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12609)|
| 3:30:15| We don't have a signed development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| And then I said, what do you need to get to a development agreement that's completed and signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12618)|
| 3:30:24| He said, we need construction plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12624)|
| 3:30:27| We need this apparatus here to get to the place where we can have development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12627)|
| 3:30:35| and that's where I want us to get, and I want us to get there fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| Because what was being said is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| Costs are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12642)|
| 3:30:44| We need to get to the place where the taxpayers are protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12644)|
| 3:30:47| and we can't get there until the development agreement is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12647)|
| 3:30:55| Remember that what is being said here is that we're using the tax incremental finance district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12655)|
| 3:31:04| to fund everything that's going on with the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12664)|
| 3:31:09| So, Mr. Mametoff, I'm going to ask you a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12669)|
| 3:31:19| Given all we've talked about and all we understand about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| would it be fair to say that the city is going to be investing $10 million to $12 million to get a $100 million stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12683)|
| 3:31:33| I think it's a very fair estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| Could you just put your mic down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| Speak into the mic, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| I think it's a very fair estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| I think it's really important to acknowledge that roughly 40% to 45% of the TIF is paid by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12701)|
| 3:31:47| Roughly 40% to 45% of the $14 million of infrastructure that you're putting in is being paid by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12707)|
| 3:31:53| That is a remarkable thing that the city and the county have been brought together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12713)|
| 3:31:57| I've worked for these projects with the city and the county for 35 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12717)|
| 3:32:01| and this has really been kind of cool to see them be so supportive of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12721)|
| 3:32:06| And so when you hear the $20 million, when you hear the other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12726)|
| 3:32:09| you've got to focus on the fact that a substantial portion of that is being paid with county tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12729)|
| 3:32:15| And so the net cost to the city, depending on where interest rates end up and how the TIF performs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12735)|
| 3:32:24| I think what Councilmember Roberto just said, Vice Mayor Roberto said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12744)|
| 3:32:27| is a pretty good estimate of where we are right now, what it will cost the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12747)|
| 3:32:32| Can I guarantee that? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12752)|
| 3:32:35| There's always ways we could improve communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12755)|
| 3:32:38| but I feel like that's a pretty good rough estimate of where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12758)|
| 3:32:42| And this amenity that we're talking about, which my colleague, Councilmember McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12762)|
| 3:32:47| was just describing as a way to provide jobs and opportunity, which is the way I see this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12767)|
| 3:32:54| and I think most of Council sees it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| it's financed through the growth and economic development inside the TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12776)|
| 3:33:02| And it has an interested party who is loaning $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12782)|
| 3:33:10| who gets an unsecured loan, who is not guaranteed to get paid back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12790)|
| 3:33:15| unless the TIF district is incredibly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12795)|
| 3:33:21| So this makes absolute sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| But what we need to do is get through this piece, get the development agreement signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12805)|
| 3:33:32| get to the part where the taxpayers are protected from overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| because I'm sure there will be overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12816)|
| 3:33:38| but we have to have the protection of the contract in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| So that's where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12822)|
| 3:33:44| And I guess the last question I'll have for 20 seconds is let's move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12824)|
| 3:33:50| Let's get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12830)|
| 3:33:53| We need to move on this because right now we have to be having more meetings of discussion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12833)|
| 3:33:59| hey, costs have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| We don't have that protection of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| So I don't know if it's a question so much as a statement, but I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=12843)|

| 3:44:29| My office represents Jim's Garage and Record Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13469)|
| 3:44:33| They are located at 5906 Walden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13473)|
| 3:44:36| We have been in a many-month discussion, not only myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13476)|
| 3:44:42| as a representative of Jim's Garage, but plenty of the other record service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13482)|
| 3:44:47| several of whom are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13487)|
| 3:44:50| And then we've also been in a discussion with the Record Commission members themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13490)|
| 3:44:54| over many months. At least one member, I think a couple might be here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13494)|
| 3:44:59| to speak on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| Long story short, it has been quite some time before the record service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13501)|
| 3:45:06| in this area, in the city of Knoxville, have seen a rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13506)|
| 3:45:11| And in that amount of time, in some documents that have been submitted to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13511)|
| 3:45:15| they have seen massive increases in their costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13515)|
| 3:45:20| And this proposal that's before you right now, this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13520)|
| 3:45:25| is basically, we are looking at it as a chance to renegotiate adjustability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13525)|
| 3:45:33| To look at ways for them to come to, not only council, but to the Record Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13533)|
| 3:45:39| and say, hey, things have changed, the market's volatile, can we look at a rate increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13539)|
| 3:45:44| even if we need a rate decrease, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13544)|
| 3:45:48| And so this is a proposal to, instead of going through the cumbersome process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13548)|
| 3:45:52| of coming to council every time that that rate increase needs to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13552)|
| 3:45:57| to go to the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13557)|
| 3:46:00| Now, I know previously there have been comments from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13560)|
| 3:46:05| that there's fear about removing this power from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13565)|
| 3:46:10| and delegating it to the subsidiary body, the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13570)|
| 3:46:15| We don't see it as a removal of power at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| Council still has ultimate authority and can take power back any time that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13579)|
| 3:46:25| As we've seen tonight, it can be a cumbersome process to move council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13585)|
| 3:46:30| to get council to take up a matter and address a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13590)|
| 3:46:34| And when, I mean, in the documents that have been provided to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13594)|
| 3:46:39| in a two-year time gap, my clients have seen a 113% increase in just fuel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13599)|
| 3:46:47| When you're dealing with a market that has that level of volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13607)|
| 3:46:51| where costs can increase so drastically, so quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13611)|
| 3:46:55| we think it's more, it allows for more adjustability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13615)|
| 3:47:00| for the Record Commission themselves to set those rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13620)|
| 3:47:03| and for us to be allowed the process of interacting with the Record Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13623)|
| 3:47:08| to then hear us, get those discussions flowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13628)|
| 3:47:12| and then take the matter up and set the rates at the Record Commission level itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13632)|
| 3:47:19| We just think, again, this is about adjustability in the face of volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13639)|
| 3:47:25| is what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| This is a more succinct process of adjusting these rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13647)|
| 3:47:33| by going to the Record Commission when we deal with a market that is so volatile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13653)|
| 3:47:38| and prices that increase so drastically, so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13658)|
| 3:47:42| That's why we and the council propose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13662)|
| 3:47:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13666)|
| 3:47:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13667)|
| 3:47:48| Council Member Riders and Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13668)|
| 3:47:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13672)|
| 3:47:54| As everyone knows, this came to us because the record service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13674)|
| 3:47:58| brought it to our attention through public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13678)|
| 3:48:01| It was discussed at audit committee, and at that time we thought, okay, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13681)|
| 3:48:07| maybe the better place is for it to move to the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13687)|
| 3:48:12| I will say Vice Mayor Roberto brought up the idea of it being in the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13692)|
| 3:48:20| and that way it gets some public light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| and still maintains the ability to be voted on in a public capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13703)|
| 3:48:28| I did have Ms. Maupin go through our ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13708)|
| 3:48:32| and compile things that are set by rate in ordinances that council votes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13712)|
| 3:48:37| and changes, and it's pretty comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| It's huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13720)|
| 3:48:41| So we set a lot of rates at council by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13721)|
| 3:48:45| So that's not unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| It's very standard in our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| So I will defer to and let some of my colleagues speak on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13729)|
| 3:48:53| because I'm not passionate one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| What I would say is that maybe what needs to happen is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13737)|
| 3:49:01| I think we have two things to vote on here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13741)|
| 3:49:04| The first one is taking it out of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13744)|
| 3:49:06| and giving it to the Record Commission to control and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13746)|
| 3:49:09| And then ordinance 12B is to actually make the recommended changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13749)|
| 3:49:13| that have come about from discussions with the Record Commission and the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13753)|
| 3:49:18| What I would say is, sorry, it's getting late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13758)|
| 3:49:25| that even if we go ahead and we don't vote on 12A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13765)|
| 3:49:29| if we don't pass that and we decide to pass 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13769)|
| 3:49:32| which is the rate increases instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13772)|
| 3:49:34| I would say we can pass that tonight as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13774)|
| 3:49:37| and then at some point put a change in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13777)|
| 3:49:42| that asks it to be reviewed on a more regular or routine basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| versus the way it came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13786)|
| 3:49:50| Before I hand over the mic, I'd like to ask Nick from Fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13790)|
| 3:49:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| When you guys are in the Record Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| do you have, like, rules of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13801)|
| 3:50:04| or do you have, like, a set of rules or anything that govern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13804)|
| 3:50:07| how you guys come about the rates or how you set things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13807)|
| 3:50:12| Yes, Mr. Bradshaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13812)|
| 3:50:14| Bradshaw, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13814)|
| 3:50:15| Yes, Nicholas Bradshaw, Director of Fleet Services for Winter Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13815)|
| 3:50:18| Yeah, we did a fair amount of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13818)|
| 3:50:21| Obviously we looked into the record companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| brought their evidence and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13823)|
| 3:50:26| based on the resources that they're spending on the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13826)|
| 3:50:29| We also did some studies of other peer cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13829)|
| 3:50:33| MTAS had some excellent data that was used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13833)|
| 3:50:36| But, yeah, a significant amount of research went into the deliberations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| over the last five or six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13840)|
| 3:50:43| But you have, like, rules or guidance for how you operate the commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13843)|
| 3:50:49| We're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| We've only met five or six times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| and this topic has been pretty heavily on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13853)|
| 3:50:56| We do not have a set of bylaws at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13856)|
| 3:50:59| Bylaws, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13859)|
| 3:51:00| That's what I was going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13860)|
| 3:51:02| But you have bylaws enough that tell you, like, who's on the record commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13862)|
| 3:51:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| Yeah, the ordinance provides a lot of guidance on powers and duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13867)|
| 3:51:10| makeup, that sort of thing, terms, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| Okay, so all I would suggest is that, to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13872)|
| 3:51:15| if we decide that we're going to leave it in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13875)|
| 3:51:18| for it to be set as a vote at council on the rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13878)|
| 3:51:22| that either your bylaws contain something about a regular review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13882)|
| 3:51:26| and some metric for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13886)|
| 3:51:28| or either our ordinance includes something like this needs to be reviewed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13888)|
| 3:51:33| you know, every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13893)|
| 3:51:36| That's my suggestion I'm throwing out to the members of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13896)|
| 3:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13900)|
| 3:51:41| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13901)|
| 3:51:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13902)|
| 3:51:43| I agree there is definitely a need for an increase in rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13903)|
| 3:51:47| And the part that concerns me, same as we had discussion last time when this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13907)|
| 3:51:52| was that this is removing council's review of rate setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13912)|
| 3:51:57| Just for informational purposes, the rates were last set in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13917)|
| 3:52:01| We haven't heard from the record commission about needing to do an increase until just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13921)|
| 3:52:10| Council Member Ryder referenced our internal auditor, Ms. Kirk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13930)|
| 3:52:14| who had done some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13934)|
| 3:52:16| Of the 33 items she reviewed, all of them except for six have council setting rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13936)|
| 3:52:24| And of those six, half of them are set by the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| So I think it would be a little unprecedented here to take council's review of this away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13948)|
| 3:52:36| I think the members of the record commission are doing a fantastic job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13956)|
| 3:52:40| and I want to say how much I appreciate them and their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13960)|
| 3:52:44| The three citizen members of the record commission have been in service for less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13964)|
| 3:52:51| They were all appointed in October of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13971)|
| 3:52:55| I definitely think we need to do this increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13975)|
| 3:52:58| but I'm uncomfortable with removing oversight at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13978)|
| 3:53:03| I do think and I would support having some mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13983)|
| 3:53:07| whether it's built into the ordinances or into the bylaws from the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13987)|
| 3:53:11| for them to have a more directed review of their rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13991)|
| 3:53:16| Because what I understood the issue here is that we had to appoint folks to be on the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=13996)|
| 3:53:23| have them review it, get them up to speed on what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14003)|
| 3:53:27| and we had COVID interfering with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14007)|
| 3:53:30| So we had a lot of things that were making this difficult for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14010)|
| 3:53:33| But I can't vote for this one, so I'll be a no on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14013)|
| 3:53:38| but I can support the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14018)|
| 3:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14021)|
| 3:53:44| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14024)|
| 3:53:45| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify if we do not vote for 12A and we do not pass 12A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14025)|
| 3:53:53| but we try to pass 12B, which is the recommended rate increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| the reason I would support that and then support either a change to the bylaws for the record commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14038)|
| 3:54:06| or a future change, which is not proposed tonight yet, to trigger a regular review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14046)|
| 3:54:13| so that it is reviewed in a public setting such as a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14053)|
| 3:54:19| I just needed to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14059)|
| 3:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14062)|
| 3:54:23| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| Quick question to Council Member Ryder, or Mrs. Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14065)|
| 3:54:30| I'm just trying to refresh my memory and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| On the rate, is it set for a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14073)|
| 3:54:36| I know they haven't been changed in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14076)|
| 3:54:39| Does this rate increase, is it established for a fixed period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14079)|
| 3:54:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14083)|
| 3:54:44| It's set until we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| And I think that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14088)|
| 3:54:49| It's stagnant until we change it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14089)|
| 3:54:52| Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14092)|
| 3:54:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14094)|
| 3:54:56| I may have missed it, but did we receive the analysis that pointed to this rate increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14096)|
| 3:55:03| I think you referenced MTAS data and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14103)|
| 3:55:06| Mr. Bradshaw, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14106)|
| 3:55:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14108)|
| 3:55:09| There was, as part of the deliberative process with the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14109)|
| 3:55:13| there was a lot of data in the record commission meetings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14113)|
| 3:55:16| I'm not sure what made its way up other than our text of our ordinance that we crafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14116)|
| 3:55:22| but, yeah, there was a lot of material generated as part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14122)|
| 3:55:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14127)|
| 3:55:28| Ms. Maupin, can you refresh Ms. Kirk's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14128)|
| 3:55:31| Sorry, I keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14131)|
| 3:55:33| That's why I can't find your e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14133)|

| 3:55:41| Ms. Kirk, you e-mailed us that, I believe, Tuesday of the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14141)|
| 3:55:46| I think that was part of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14146)|
| 3:55:48| Councilwoman Tesherman, do you recall that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14148)|
| 3:55:50| I think that's one of the reasons you were in favor of a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14150)|
| 3:55:53| is because we either got that information at the meeting or in an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14153)|
| 3:55:58| We got it in an e-mail that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14158)|
| 3:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14161)|
| 3:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14162)|
| 3:56:07| Mr. Smith, do you have any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14167)|
| 3:56:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14177)|
| 3:56:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14178)|

| 3:56:42| I need to do some more research on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14202)|
| 3:56:45| but I plan to support the general recommendation next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14205)|
| 3:56:50| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14210)|
| 3:56:51| What Councilman Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14213)|
| 3:56:54| Basically what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14214)|
| 3:56:55| I don't feel comfortable making a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| I believe I'll abstain and study it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14217)|
| 3:57:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14222)|
| 3:57:03| Just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14223)|
| 3:57:04| This is just first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14224)|
| 3:57:05| Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14225)|
| 3:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14227)|
| 3:57:08| Can someone speak to the rates and the charges that we're looking at in our packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14228)|
| 3:57:15| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| Mr. Justice has signed up to speak to this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14237)|
| 3:57:20| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14240)|
| 3:57:21| Mr. Justice, could you come and you'll have up to five minutes to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14241)|
| 3:57:25| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14245)|
| 3:57:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14246)|
| 3:57:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14247)|
| 3:57:28| And, again, I can answer questions if any members of the council have it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14248)|
| 3:57:31| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14251)|
| 3:57:32| This is the meat of what my client and the other record service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14252)|
| 3:57:39| wanted and came to council many, many months ago to start the process of is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14259)|
| 3:57:45| this rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14265)|
| 3:57:46| As has been said many times, this rate increase is near a decade old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14266)|
| 3:57:52| since the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14272)|
| 3:57:53| And in the packet that I believe was provided to council, you, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14273)|
| 3:57:58| have seen the rates of all of the services that they provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14278)|
| 3:58:03| all the things that they have to purchase to provide the services that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14283)|
| 3:58:07| need to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14287)|
| 3:58:08| Those rates have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14288)|
| 3:58:10| Another thing that we've looked at, and this, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14290)|
| 3:58:12| goes hopefully to the research that some of the council members want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14292)|
| 3:58:16| we have provided standard rates from various cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14296)|
| 3:58:21| comparable cities in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| I heard earlier tonight that, unfortunately, we get compared to Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14303)|
| 3:58:27| That's on the top of our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14307)|
| 3:58:29| Please don't hold that against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14309)|
| 3:58:30| But we've got rates from Chattanooga, Asheville, Montgomery, Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14310)|
| 3:58:34| Memphis, Louisville, Kentucky, Norfolk, Virginia, Richmond, Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14314)|
| 3:58:38| Columbia, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14318)|
| 3:58:40| By the way, I want to give credit where credit is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14320)|
| 3:58:43| Other members beside or members of the commission provided these rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14323)|
| 3:58:48| and this data for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14328)|
| 3:58:50| And so they have very much been an ally in this whole process of bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14330)|
| 3:58:57| this to council for this rate increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14337)|
| 3:58:59| But if you do a look at the numbers, our current tow rates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14339)|
| 3:59:05| significantly lower than all other cities on this sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14345)|
| 3:59:11| In fact, the rate increases that we are proposing to council right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14351)|
| 3:59:16| in this ordinance brings us close, but not all the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| brings us close to the bottom of the list of the rates that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14360)|
| 3:59:25| for Chattanooga, Asheville, Memphis, Louisville, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14365)|
| 3:59:29| So, again, that is what we are asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14369)|
| 3:59:32| We're asking for this rate increase that brings us up even with the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14372)|
| 3:59:37| of the rate increases that we're seeing around the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| to comparable cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14379)|
| 3:59:41| And that's why we're proposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14381)|
| 3:59:44| As far as the service providers are concerned, this has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14384)|
| 3:59:48| You can even say long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14388)|
| 3:59:50| We understand that this takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14390)|
| 3:59:52| But, again, we are trying to catch up with the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14392)|
| 3:59:55| bring the Knoxville tow rates up to the bottom of the other comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14395)|
| 4:00:01| cities around our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| And, again, if I can answer questions, I'd be more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14403)|
| 4:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14408)|
| 4:00:10| Council Member McKenzie, I think you had the floor before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14410)|
| 4:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14414)|
| 4:00:15| Sarah, if you could stay at the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14415)|
| 4:00:17| I just want to make sure that I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14417)|
| 4:00:20| So if I am a private citizen and it's under Section 2 in our packet, page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14420)|
| 4:00:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14426)|
| 4:00:27| I'm having a hard time hearing you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14427)|
| 4:00:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14428)|
| 4:00:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14429)|
| 4:00:30| On page 597 of our packet, item number 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14430)|
| 4:00:33| vehicles not involved in the collision towed to a city lot at direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| of the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14437)|
| 4:00:39| That towing fee, I'm just going to look at Class A because that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14439)|
| 4:00:42| just your typical car, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14442)|
| 4:00:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14444)|
| 4:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| So me being the private citizen, say that I'm parked illegally or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14447)|
| 4:00:51| something, whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| officer puts a call in and says, hey, tow my vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14453)|
| 4:00:57| In order for me to get my vehicle back, I'm going to have to pay $106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14457)|
| 4:01:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14462)|
| 4:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14463)|
| 4:01:04| Now, also in the event that I'm not able to get my vehicle immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14464)|
| 4:01:11| after 24 hours, I'm going to be charged $30 per day, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14471)|
| 4:01:16| I can't speak to the impound lot's charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14476)|
| 4:01:18| In fact, can you point me to what page you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14478)|
| 4:01:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14482)|
| 4:01:23| Page 597 and 598.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14483)|
| 4:01:26| If you're looking at the packet that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| Would those be the applicable tow rates or the storage rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14491)|
| 4:01:37| It's page 3 on probably your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14497)|
| 4:01:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14501)|
| 4:01:44| Your page 3 is our page 597.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14504)|
| 4:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14506)|
| 4:01:47| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| That $30, I mean, seems kind of low because I want to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14509)|
| 4:01:53| maybe a couple years ago I've heard something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14513)|
| 4:01:56| I can defer to some of my more experienced, the service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14516)|
| 4:02:00| but my understanding of the storage rate that you're referring to is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14520)|
| 4:02:04| when a vehicle is towed to the private tow service provider's lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14524)|
| 4:02:12| From the majority of what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14532)|
| 4:02:14| we're talking about when vehicles are towed to the city impound lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14534)|
| 4:02:18| And those storage rates, I believe, are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14538)|
| 4:02:21| Do we have anyone that could speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14541)|
| 4:02:24| So this $30 is not to a city lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14544)|
| 4:02:28| This is to a private lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14548)|
| 4:02:30| Or will those vary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14550)|
| 4:02:31| Yeah, there's separate standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| There's a whole separate section of code for what governs the impound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14553)|
| 4:02:38| The rates, just for informational purposes, at impound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14558)|
| 4:02:41| it's $8 a day in storage rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14561)|
| 4:02:44| and that starts after the third day for 72 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14564)|
| 4:02:47| which is significantly lower than the rate that you set for the private tow lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14567)|
| 4:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14574)|
| 4:02:55| But it sounds like these fees that we're looking at could vary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14575)|
| 4:03:00| depending on the record service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14580)|
| 4:03:02| And if that's the case, if the answer to that is yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14582)|
| 4:03:04| what's that variable look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14584)|
| 4:03:06| What percentage of variation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| I'm guessing that's you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14588)|
| 4:03:10| I can speak to the impound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14590)|
| 4:03:12| but I don't know as much about the record services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14592)|
| 4:03:15| For instance, Anderson Automotive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14595)|
| 4:03:18| April from Anderson Automotive just came and spoke with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14598)|
| 4:03:21| The individual lots, I think they basically control a lot of their own rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14601)|
| 4:03:26| But the rate at Anderson Automotive is $20 per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14606)|
| 4:03:30| However, I would want to say that this ordinance is only referring to tows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14610)|
| 4:03:35| that are in the city rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14615)|
| 4:03:38| And my understanding is that 99% of the city rotation tows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14618)|
| 4:03:43| if they're going to an impound lot or if they're going to a lot to be stored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14623)|
| 4:03:47| they're going to the city impound lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| So the ordinance that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14629)|
| 4:03:52| those tows are not affected by private storage rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14632)|
| 4:03:57| These are the city storage rates that will be applied to the towing under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14637)|
| 4:04:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14642)|
| 4:04:03| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| Council Member, well, Vice Member Berto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14645)|
| 4:04:09| and then Mr. Thomas and then Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14649)|
| 4:04:13| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14653)|
| 4:04:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14654)|
| 4:04:15| We don't know who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| We're going to let Council Member Thomas go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14659)|
| 4:04:20| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14660)|
| 4:04:23| Just a quick question from any of you who would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14663)|
| 4:04:26| I know we're talking about towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14666)|
| 4:04:28| How does booting cars, who sets the rate for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14668)|
| 4:04:32| or is that included in the rate structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14672)|
| 4:04:37| I know that it's not included in this ordinance that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14677)|
| 4:04:40| but as far as who, I would have to defer to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14680)|
| 4:04:43| I'm pretty sure that's under the authority of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14683)|
| 4:04:47| It's not part of the record services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| It's not in their purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| That's exactly what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14693)|
| 4:04:54| Vice Member Berto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14694)|
| 4:04:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14695)|
| 4:04:57| Director Bradshaw, currently at the impound lot, the city's impound lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14697)|
| 4:05:04| your release rate over the last several years has been to the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14704)|
| 4:05:11| maybe about 30% of the vehicles are not picked up at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14711)|
| 4:05:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14715)|
| 4:05:16| Yeah, it's in the upper 20s, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14716)|
| 4:05:18| I think we tend to release between 71% and 73% over the last four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14718)|
| 4:05:24| I can get you the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14724)|
| 4:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14726)|
| 4:05:27| And the 30% or so that aren't picked up, just in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14727)|
| 4:05:32| I would imagine those are the vehicles that are not in as good a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14732)|
| 4:05:38| That's typical, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14738)|
| 4:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14740)|
| 4:05:41| So piggybacking on what my colleague, Council Member McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14741)|
| 4:05:44| was talking about, about these rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14744)|
| 4:05:47| part of the issue that I had with it is I don't want to see an increase in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14747)|
| 4:05:51| rates that causes more people not to be able to get their vehicles out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14751)|
| 4:05:56| impound lot because I think that's going to adversely affect people who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14756)|
| 4:06:00| have means to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14760)|
| 4:06:03| But we have to balance that with we also need to make sure we're increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14763)|
| 4:06:07| the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14767)|
| 4:06:08| This is why I really struggle with the across-the-board approach that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14768)|
| 4:06:11| taken here, where it's just a 50% across-the-board increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14771)|
| 4:06:16| What we were talking about with that example previously was it would cost the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14776)|
| 4:06:22| no-collision class A would be $126.75 to get your vehicle out of the impound lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14782)|
| 4:06:34| So that was my concern with this across-the-board approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14794)|
| 4:06:38| I do think we need to do an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| and I believe that the record commission is going to be meeting sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14800)|
| 4:06:45| early September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| It might be a good idea since several of our members don't feel like they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| enough information right now to have this go back to the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14811)|
| 4:06:56| look at this again, and based off of our conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14816)|
| 4:07:01| see what you want to do to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14821)|
| 4:07:03| You may even want to bring us something that lets us kind of codify the review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14823)|
| 4:07:09| of these rate increases going forward like Councilmember Ryder had recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14829)|
| 4:07:14| But that's the part that I'm uncomfortable with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14834)|
| 4:07:19| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| Yeah, so I do not have my packet with me, but this is the packet that we all got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14841)|
| 4:07:27| Ms. Kirk, did we get this emailed to us, or everybody just got a hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14851)|
| 4:07:32| We have this both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14852)|
| 4:07:33| We have this in our email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| This packet from the record commission includes a survey of other cities like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14855)|
| 4:07:41| Asheville and Chattanooga and their rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14861)|
| 4:07:44| and then it includes what the record services requested from the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14864)|
| 4:07:50| commission and what the record commission deliberated and suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14870)|
| 4:07:54| Correct, Mr. Bradshaw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14874)|
| 4:07:57| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14877)|
| 4:07:58| Okay, and that's how you arrived at what is in the ordinance that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14878)|
| 4:08:02| vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14882)|
| 4:08:05| So they surveyed other places and came to their decision in what I would call an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14885)|
| 4:08:12| evidence-based-ish manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14892)|
| 4:08:15| And then on page 297 of our packet is the comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14895)|
| 4:08:20| And so you have this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14900)|
| 4:08:22| You will see that in most places the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14902)|
| 4:08:29| which in that column we have is called Nick's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14909)|
| 4:08:32| versus the record company proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14912)|
| 4:08:35| And many of them, they're the same, and they agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14915)|
| 4:08:39| There's a couple of them where the record commission is requesting slightly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14919)|
| 4:08:44| So although I will say, Mr. Bradshaw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14924)|
| 4:08:48| in the ordinance that we're voting on, Section 1, Chapter 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14928)|
| 4:08:56| that first chart, the maximum fees for all record services provided by any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14936)|
| 4:09:00| record service certificate holder on the rotation log,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14940)|
| 4:09:03| city-owned facilities to a city facility, Class A, Class B, Class C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14943)|
| 4:09:07| You have Class B in this chart in the ordinance for us to vote on is $90 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14947)|
| 4:09:11| unit, but in your chart you have $80 per unit in the packet that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14951)|
| 4:09:17| Yeah, that was I presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| You must have the handout that I handed out during the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14959)|
| 4:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14964)|
| 4:09:25| Yes, I did design an alternative proposal and presented it to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14965)|
| 4:09:30| and it was not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14970)|
| 4:09:32| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14972)|
| 4:09:33| The ordinance that is in front of you is what the commission approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14977)|
| 4:09:38| So the numbers in this column aren't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14978)|
| 4:09:42| this was the deliberative conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14982)|
| 4:09:45| You've got the page that says Nick's proposal on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14985)|
| 4:09:47| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14987)|

| 4:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14989)|
| 4:09:50| That was my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14992)|
| 4:09:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14993)|
| 4:09:54| Well, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14994)|
| 4:09:55| I will just say this to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14995)|
| 4:09:58| I feel like we've been discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=14998)|
| 4:10:01| Do we remember when this came up originally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15001)|
| 4:10:04| I received a phone call from the tow companies in fall of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15004)|
| 4:10:13| and then there was not much movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15013)|
| 4:10:16| and they came to a council meeting and spoke at public forum in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15016)|
| 4:10:20| I believe, March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15020)|
| 4:10:22| And so it's been in the works since November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15022)|
| 4:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15025)|
| 4:10:26| I will just say for the efforts that they put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15026)|
| 4:10:28| I'm comfortable voting on this tonight, but if my colleagues are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15028)|
| 4:10:32| I will just say if we postpone this another two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15032)|
| 4:10:35| I'm not comfortable postponing it until the next record commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15035)|
| 4:10:39| because I feel like we've been discussing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| and these folks are towing these cars and not getting paid for the gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15041)|
| 4:10:44| that they're hauling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15044)|
| 4:10:45| I will say if we postpone it another two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15045)|
| 4:10:48| I would ask that we would pass it on emergency next time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15048)|
| 4:10:51| but I'm also comfortable voting on it tonight because I feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15051)|
| 4:10:54| record commission has deliberated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15054)|
| 4:10:56| They've taken information from the providers as well as other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15056)|
| 4:10:59| and came up with a pretty round number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| But I understand that we've all not maybe had time to ask questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15062)|
| 4:11:08| and that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15068)|
| 4:11:12| Council Member Testerman and then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15072)|
| 4:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15075)|
| 4:11:17| I would concur with Council Member Ryder in the fact that we do take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15077)|
| 4:11:23| to appoint members to this commission for them to be able to do the due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15083)|
| 4:11:29| have these conversations, consult with all the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15089)|
| 4:11:35| and then bring their recommendations to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15095)|
| 4:11:40| My thought is that we need to consider the recommendations that they've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15100)|
| 4:11:47| the time to thoroughly present to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15107)|
| 4:11:51| And, again, we have been talking about this topic for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15111)|
| 4:11:55| and they have incurred a lot of expenses despite, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15115)|
| 4:12:01| increased costs and many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15121)|
| 4:12:07| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15127)|
| 4:12:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15129)|
| 4:12:11| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15131)|
| 4:12:13| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15133)|
| 4:12:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15134)|
| 4:12:15| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15135)|
| 4:12:16| I'll just say that I think Council Member Ryder makes a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15136)|
| 4:12:20| and so does Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15140)|
| 4:12:22| We do have a committee that was formed and worked on this, made recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15142)|
| 4:12:27| So I can support this increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15147)|
| 4:12:30| I do agree that there's been a significant amount of hardship on the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15150)|
| 4:12:36| that are doing this work because of the increased costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15156)|
| 4:12:39| So I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15159)|
| 4:12:40| I would just say we definitely need to keep an eye on the in-pound release rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15160)|
| 4:12:46| and I would ask that the commission keep an eye on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15166)|
| 4:12:49| And, Director Bradshaw, if you could assist with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15169)|
| 4:12:52| Because if we start to see an increase, I think we need to take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15172)|
| 4:12:55| and look at whether or not we may have increased it by a little too much there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15175)|
| 4:13:00| I can go ahead and vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15180)|
| 4:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15181)|
| 4:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15183)|
| 4:13:04| Yeah, I don't really want to vote on it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15184)|
| 4:13:06| but along with Council Person Ryder's suggestion, I think we could postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15186)|
| 4:13:11| I would certainly, I think, be in favor of hearing it on emergency the next time it came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15191)|
| 4:13:18| and that would keep the applicants within the two-week period as far as when it would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15198)|
| 4:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15211)|

| 4:13:45| There's no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220823?start=15225)|
