| 0:22:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I don't know if Dawn Vistler is back there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah, Janet Wright will be addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Dawn and her staff are at a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I guess I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| This looks like it's sort of new cutting edge technology stuff because the way it's described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| in there you've got to get a couple of units and try them out and see if that works and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| cancel at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| So could you tell us a little bit about this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Obviously, you want to know where your vehicles are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| and how to help people get to them and get the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| but tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Well, this is a computer system, as you might imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| that will provide both software and hardware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| for the CAT paratransit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| which is a service that they provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| for people that qualify to schedule appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| like dental appointments, medical appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| So there's a lot of scheduling that goes on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| so it provides the software for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| as well as the location of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| So the system will actually email them or text them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| when they're going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| and allow them to cancel that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Give them a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| As a reminder the night before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| And then prior to picking them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| since we know where the vehicle is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| it will also text them and let them know I'm 10 minutes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| No, it sounded really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| I was just curious, is it being done somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| or are we kind of on the frontier here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| No, actually, this particular company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| they're called Ecolane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| They have delivered systems all over the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| So we're just getting a known product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1461)|
| 0:24:21| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| I'm sorry, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| This does sound pretty neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| It sort of sounds like Uber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Is it similar to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Is there a plan to use it for all the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| and for all riders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Yes, but it's a different, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| you don't make an appointment to have someone pick you up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| for mass transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| But it is very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| And we do have AVL already installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| on our mass transit buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| What we don't have and what we'd like to get at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| is the where's my bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| So that with a smart device, you could actually look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| and say, oh, I'm right here and my bus is coming down this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| So that is what we are aspiring to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Okay, I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1510)|

| 0:27:01| This is another big step for our park system in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| And I think Carol Evans is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| And as she's taking her way down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| I want to recognize her to give just a brief overview of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| But I've been on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| And I urge you once it's ready for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| to be there to go look at this because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| the most magnificent view of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| I think, that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| But Carol, thank you for all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| that you've done to get it to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1651)|
| 0:27:31| I'm Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| And it's actually our 10th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| So we're really happy to be able to give the gift to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| It really was the starting point of Knoxville's Urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Wilderness Initiative some four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| And just a reminder, Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| was really formed by the approval of our mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| at the time and has, I think, for the past 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| really enjoyed your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| And we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Great collaboration with Joe Walsh and the City Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Worked very closely together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| So really, thank you for the opportunity to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| and add parks to our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| How many acres is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| About 1,200 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Yeah, I would say we're over 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| And this particular piece is actually a Civil War battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1694)|
| 0:28:14| So we're able to save that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| and really promote the history of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Thanks, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1705)|
| 0:28:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| to execute an agreement with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| for professional services for a Project Safe Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Zone process and outcome evaluation for a total three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| year contract amount not to exceed $67,788.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Councilman Dela Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Yeah, maybe Deputy Chief Nate Allen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| can tell us about this project and how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| It sounds interesting, but I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| to know a little bit about the objective and the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| This project here, it's taken from the Mayor's Save Our Sun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| What we're going to use it for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| a prerequisite for a much bigger grant for $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| This $67,000 is going to be spread to the college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| for over a three year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| And with the three year period, what it's going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| is it's going to allow them to do some research in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| kind of get the community involved in the initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| also, go out there and get more people involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| You let them know about it and do some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| They have to use the $67,000 over a three year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| So that gives them $27,500 a year to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| And that has to be used up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| But remember, this is the prerequisite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| for the much bigger grant for the $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| And are they going to be working with neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| or individual kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Or what do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Both, neighborhood and individual kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Just for the record, though, UT, this is with Swarps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And so they are actually doing the evaluation for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| But the project itself is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| the implementation of the Save Our Suns Initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| within the Project Safe Neighborhood Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| It's a geographically based zone looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| at where there were problems and opportunities for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| to affect to reduce violence, increase opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| for our young men and boys of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| So this is basically funds that have come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| that you all have previously approved that will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| us implement Save Our Suns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| But this piece itself is the required evaluation piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| that the grantor requires that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| So we've got UT bringing its expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| from its criminal justice planning group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| to help us get that done, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| No, they're doing this as the social work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| group, the public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| And they are helping us set up the program in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| that it can be evaluated for effectiveness as we move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| OK, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| 11.0 is a resolution of council authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| and, if awarded, accept a brownfield cleanup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| to provide funding in the total amount of $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| with an additional city match of $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| to carry out cleanup activities at the former sanitary laundry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| property located at 625 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| 625, is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1902)|
| 0:31:42| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| I know that this project has been put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| and I believe there was only one proposal that was given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| and it was decided to put that off until this could help maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| with the cost of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| What kind of schedule are we looking at with this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Ann Wallace, our Deputy Director in our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| has been facilitating with EPA, TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| and our environmental consultants on these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| So I'm going to let Ann speak for us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Good evening, Mayor and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Ann Wallace, Office of Redevelopment, Deputy Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| The timeline for the grant, it's a three-year grant cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| the lifetime of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Typically, EPA awards the grants about three to four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| after they're submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| The deadline for this grant is December 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| so it would likely be spring of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| when we would receive the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And then we have up to three years to spend those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| doing the cleanup of the site, and it is site-dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| on how long it would take to do the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| I would say, in this case, it would probably take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| potentially the full three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| So we won't be asking for a proposal, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| for at least three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| I would say that's a fair estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| because we do have to retain fee simple ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| of the property until we close out the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Councilman Delvaux, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I guess I'm wondering, we picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| this former sanitary laundry property at a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| but we got sort of a white elephant in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| I guess, the amount of chemical contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| that must be there from the cleaning fluids and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| Just curious, is there any attempt to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| the original owners of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| to reimburse any of these costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I realize these are EPA monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| but I think the Clean Water Act allows for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| to go back against the original polluters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| and kind of make them pony up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| If I may, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| and I'll be happy to defer to the law director as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| but there's a process called all appropriate inquiries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| that has to be performed before any federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| can be used on a property of this nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| that determines whether or not any previous owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| still exists and has resources or capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| that could be used to clean up the environmental issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| that they've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| We did that as part of our phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| and phase two assessment grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| that were done through the EPA assessment grant process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| that we had that was approved back in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| There is no justifiable property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| who has resources that would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| to take care of this cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| They don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| They just disappeared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Well, the corporation, I guess, probably disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| What about the owners? Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| My understanding is that the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| transferred decades ago into private hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Again, anyone involved in the ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| and creation of contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| would be held liable under the CERCLA law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Unfortunately, those parties have not been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| and they are not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| and have resources available to clean this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| That's why the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| is willing to utilize its funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| to assess and clean up the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Okay, thanks. I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Anne, as you know, that area is dear to my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| and I would hope that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| will continue to take responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| to keep the building boarded up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| but possibly you might want to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| about painting the plywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| so that it looks a little bit more desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| especially with all the other businesses down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| sprucing themselves up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| So if you would consider that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Certainly, and one of the other aspects to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| is building maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| while we're doing the environmental work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| and that's something that we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| coming back to council for in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| recognizing that through no fault of our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| we have inherited a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| that has issues that need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| and it's our opportunity to set it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| for success in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2149)|
| 0:35:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Could you have said you didn't want it at the tax sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| No, no, don't give it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Well, here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Who else is going to deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| We have access to these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Who else has the capacity to deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| If we don't take it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| then it sits and continues to deteriorate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| and to cause negative impact on all the property values there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| So this is a time when it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| and it's desirable for us to step in to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| Otherwise, you've got a brownfield in your midst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| We have a brownfield forever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| as everything else is trying to get redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| And all of us in that area appreciate the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| of what the city's doing, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| I think you should paint that little plywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you, Ian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2186)|
| 0:36:26| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| I think maybe public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| will have that painted tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2190)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| With the pickup trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Yeah, right, there's pickup trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Okay, so I think we have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2204)|
| 0:36:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| 11P is a resolution of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| necessary to apply for and, if awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| accept a brownfield cleanup grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| from the United States Environmental Protection Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| to provide funding in the total amount of $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| with an additional city match of $40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| to carry out cleanup activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| at the former McClung Warehouse properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I'm calling on Dawn Michelle again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| to kind of give us an update on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| we talked last week about what the update is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| on this property and what the timeline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| You see this going forward on this initial process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| and then we've got other things coming down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| I think it's, I've talked to a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| since we talked and there's quite a bit of stir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| about that amongst those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I want to kind of talk a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Sure, Dawn Michelle Foster, Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| This cleanup grant here actually sets the stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| for what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| redevelop that McClung Warehouse area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| As Anne said, it's a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Once that grant gets initiated and approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| and we are a recipient of that moving on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| along with that Jackson Avenue Warehouse area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| we have several things into play there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Coordination with TDOT's work on the Broadway Viaduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| is going to be a big factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| but that will give us time to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| and pursue the cleanup efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| in that three-year time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| when all that's going on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| So we're keeping a pulse on the area there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| in the McClung Warehouse area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| So we're hoping that by the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| we'll have everything in play in order to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| with the mixed-use development opportunity on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| So even though it's going to take three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| for this to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| we're going to continue to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I think the plan is to find a master developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| or put out an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| I mean, talk a little bit about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| while simultaneously we're not just waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| three years to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2321)|
| 0:38:41| We're going to do some things concurrently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| along with developing a great RFP for that site as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| along with the cleanup grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| And Anne is standing up here again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| to probably add some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| in regards to the grant efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| the issues associated with this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| are significantly less than what was found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| at the sanitary laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| The uses obviously were very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and therefore the contamination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| and the presence of materials are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| However, what was found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| higher concentrations of benzene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| asbestos material associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| with the former McClung Warehouse's buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| do need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| before we would be able to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| with mixed-use redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| We would anticipate the timeline of this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| running faster than the three-year timeline period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| even though that's the timeline of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| So we would anticipate being able to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| the cleanup work much more quickly than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And if the opportunity presented itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| in conjunction with TDOT's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| as Dawn Michelle mentioned on the Broadway Viaduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| we could put those properties out for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| sooner than the three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| And we did check with EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| and confirmed that we would be able to release the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| as long as we had concluded the grant work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| And how long do you think construction will take on that viaduct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| What are you estimating that to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Just our meetings with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| and what we've been hearing from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| is it would probably take about three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| for that construction period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| And I think the point of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| and the point of bringing this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| and talking about it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| is to make sure that we don't lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| We've got a lot of momentum going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| We've got a serious project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| over a $3 million project going there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| on the corner of Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| with that brew pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| and other properties have been bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| And it's going to be disruptive at the very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| And I guess I was surprised to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| that it was going to take three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| And hopefully we can move this thing along simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| and concurrently, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| and not lose the momentum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| and not lose a lot of interest in the property down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| and keep people interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| So I think that's something for people to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| Councilman, we totally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| We've had that discussion even today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| In our meetings, our economic development meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| that we have every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| And we talked about keeping that momentum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| even though we know TDOT needs to use some of those lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| for the lay-down yard, for the biodeck product still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| We can project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| We can still keep it moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Do the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Did our RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Keep things going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| And also make sure that worked with the other activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| that's already there to keep that alive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| We agree with you on the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I've heard from the property owners down there this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| since we talked last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I mean, they're very concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| And three years sounds like an awfully long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| when they've invested quite a bit of money to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| and I think they knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I mean, but I'm not sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| but anyway, when it's reality, it's one thing to know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| but then begin to experience it pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| 12A is an emergency, an emergency ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| to amend Knoxville City Code Chapter 4, Article 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Sections 96 through Section 127 to establish a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| for City Council to approve certificates of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| for retail, food store, liquor license applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| I think legal should take a second look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| at some of the language that appears on page 871| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| of the packet in Section 4-123.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| If I read that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| the applicant for this wine license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| if it's a partnership or corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| has to have the name, age, and address of each partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| which would be probably fairly simple with partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| or stockholder, and I'm picturing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2552)|

| 0:42:37| Maybe that should be 5% or more shareholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| or something that every stockholder that owns stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| in one of those public companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| sounds like a lot of folks and a lot of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| We could get you to run down to the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2569)|

| 0:43:00| and if the state statute was as smart as you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| we wouldn't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Maybe you should write to our lobbyists down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| and say, that's a crazy, that's a crazy idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2589)|

| 0:44:20| our good friend, Ms. Terry Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Faulkner, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Where are the cookies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Are you supposed to bring cookies tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Or chocolate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| You know, I'm going to set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2672)|

| 0:44:40| Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, and that's 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| And I'm here tonight representing the Buren Council once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| to thank you for the discretionary funds for our community park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| as well as to re-thank you and the city administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| for all the support you have shown for this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| And because Carol Evans is here, too, I would like to really thank her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| for being our 501C3 for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| and she has been just great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| We're lucky to have her here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| We are now at the point of choosing a landscape architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| to design the landscape plan for this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| which is located in the hub of our Bearden Pedestrian Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| As you all remember, I'm sure, the goal of our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| which serves as the umbrella group for five neighborhoods in the Bearden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| for the last 14 years has been to implement the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| put forth in our MPC Bearden Village Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| I distributed some information to you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| I'm not sure that I mailed all of you a park brochure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| but you have our new brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| And the other papers are Xerox from our Bearden Village Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| Mine's getting a little bit ratty from use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| But the color sheet shows the pedestrian public transit hub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| for the Bearden Village at the corner of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| and Forest Park Boulevard near the Earth Fair Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| whereas the transit center building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| that the MPC staff suggested be placed at this hub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| and that's the second handout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and it shows the concept plan for a transit building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| which would provide a pleasant and dry place for CAT patrons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| residents, and Greenway users to rest, eat lunch, read, and chat with others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| This was not achievable by our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| but we are going to have a community park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| and additional shelters in that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| and we would not be able to undertake this effort without your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| And we sincerely thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Thank you, Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil151027?start=2815)|
