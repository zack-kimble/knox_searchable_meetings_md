| 3:01:52| and it was so soothing, and I wake up in the middle of the night and it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| and I'm sweating, and it raises my anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10916)|
| 3:02:00| Commissioner Schoonmaker was at an event I spoke at a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| and a question came up about what keeps me awake at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| and the answer is the Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| We'll come back to you in a couple weeks or a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| We'd like to have sort of a larger discussion about development pressures in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| There are some unique characteristics there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| In particular, the fact that most developments are going to have to cross Connor Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10941)|
| 3:02:26| so in Hardin Valley we're seeing features and subdivisions historically that we did not see, including bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| That raises discussion in some cases regarding guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10952)|
| 3:02:36| which are not popular for a variety of reasons with the development community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| But Connor Creek is the water of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| This is a difficult area topographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| The topography is difficult topographically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| It's difficult to develop because of steep slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| and that's certainly something that's affecting the property across from Mr. Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| and it's going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| The development pressures out there are enormous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10978)|
| 3:03:01| As Mr. Hall mentioned, according to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10981)|
| 3:03:05| traffic counts on Hardin Valley Road west of Pellissippi Parkway have increased 108% between 2005 and 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10985)|
| 3:03:15| I'll bet you Commissioner Brantley can validate every bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=10995)|
| 3:03:21| When I drive through, especially when I drive through from the west end going east and I see the rooftops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11001)|
| 3:03:28| it causes me pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| We'll continue, as I told Mr. Hall and his neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11011)|
| 3:03:34| we will not leave them hanging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| We don't know what conditions will look like post-construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| but once we do and we have a known quantity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| we'll do what's necessary to keep them in the best shape that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| And, again, at some point in the next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| we would like to have sort of a larger conversation at commission about Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| and some of the development pressures that we're experiencing out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| just so that at least you're aware of what's happening and what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| and what you might anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11041)|
| 3:04:02| Dwight, a part of that discussion, and you and I have had this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| are you going to set aside funds to do a traffic study out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11045)|
| 3:04:10| to get a ballpark of what it's going to need to look like later on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| Cindy Pianchi is in discussions with Jeff Welch at the TPO about doing an overall corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11054)|
| 3:04:20| I did have money in the budget that commission approved this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| for general consulting services for that Hardin Valley corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11063)|
| 3:04:28| because we know, aside from the construction and drainage pressures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| transportation facilities are going to be at issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| and people can do site-specific development like shopping centers and subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| far faster than Jim Snowden can build a linear project like a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| So there will continue to be transportation pressures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| and hopefully we'll have the corridor study underway in this fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| and start to do some longer-range transportation planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| Just logistically, the TPO, if we wait on having that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| we're ten years down the road before we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11098)|
| 3:05:01| Is it something that the county can maybe look at capital dollars on as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| unless we connect some state routes or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| If we wait on the TPO, we'll never catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| They've got such a backlog. It's not their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11111)|
| 3:05:14| There's a backlog there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| We want to go ahead and engage them in the larger discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| particularly as it relates to the corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| because it'll cover the area in greater terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| When we get into actual physical improvements to the transportation infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| a lot of those may just be local dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| at EPW capital dollars that we'll bring to commission in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| for projects that we think can bring some interim relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11143)|
| 3:05:44| Who is the contractor or developer that's across from Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| It's currently the Pipe Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11148)|
| 3:05:51| They are actually the second-grading contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| I don't recollect. I can find out who the first one was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| but Pipe Doctor is the second one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| and I will say that while we have had what I would characterize as pointed discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11158)|
| 3:06:06| surprisingly pointed discussions with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11166)|
| 3:06:09| in all fairness, they have done everything that we have asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11169)|
| 3:06:13| and they have done it expeditiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11173)|
| 3:06:19| Again, I believe in all of these things the way I see them, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11179)|
| 3:06:23| and Pipe Doctor's supervision on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11183)|
| 3:06:26| has been significantly better than their predecessors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| Clearly, we haven't had real pleasant exchanges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| but they've been productive, and that's more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11196)|
| 3:06:37| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| I think the Pipe Doctor had that site up on Campbell Station on top of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| that we had so many problems on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| Are they grading that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| That's the one that was affecting Mr. Holland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| I think at one point they were contributory to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11210)|
| 3:06:53| but at this point not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| There's another site then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| Candidly, Commissioner Brantley, sometimes in Hardin Valley they all start to run together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| because there are so many at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| And they're so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11223)|
| 3:07:04| One of the things about that area is the type of terrain and the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11224)|
| 3:07:10| Whatever happens in one place is going to affect other people down the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11234)|
| 3:07:15| Is there not a retaining pond for this construction site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| There is, and there will be permanent features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| They're both construction phase features on the site now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11243)|
| 3:07:26| and then there will be permanent stormwater features post-construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11246)|
| 3:07:30| The features that have been on the site during the construction phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| have failed repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| Because it's steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| Once that water gets flowing, it's not going to stop there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| because it's the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| I guess it's not smooth grading, it's steep grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11262)|
| 3:07:45| That's not Hardin, that's Hickory Creek, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| Hickory Creek, yes, it's off Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| But to your question about Mr. Holland, he's been affected by multiple sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| and that sometimes is a little tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| The inspectors have done in particular a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| walking back from a problem area to identify what has been contributory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11279)|
| 3:08:07| Just so you know, we have a lot of talented staff involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| Chris Cronjue and Leo LeCamere are here from stormwater management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11291)|
| 3:08:15| and they handle the plans review and the ordinance side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| Brad Warren is here from construction services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| Brad supervises the inspectors who handle the site inspection during construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11300)|
| 3:08:25| I will tell you we are working hard at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| and probably hard enough that you're getting complaints from the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| and that's the tricky space in which we try to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| and that is creating conditions where people can successfully develop their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| but at the same time protecting the interests of folks like Mr. Holland and his neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11318)|
| 3:08:43| It has not been an easy job this summer with as much rain as we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11323)|
| 3:08:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11329)|
| 3:08:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| Dwight, looking at these pictures and looking at KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| I see this one culvert that looks like it goes under the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| Is the entire site of the development draining through that one culvert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| No, sir, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| Some of it is, but not the entire site by no means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| When the water comes across through that culvert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| the topography looks like there's no ditch line to carry it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11353)|
| 3:09:17| I would guess from that point would be west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11357)|
| 3:09:21| and it just comes on across their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| Is that part of the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11363)|
| 3:09:26| Well, on the side of the road that's under development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| there's clearly a capacity issue with the ditch, which needs to be cleaned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11368)|
| 3:09:32| We want to add capacity to that ditch and stabilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| The cross run under the road that you refer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| if you're looking at the same picture I'm thinking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11377)|
| 3:09:40| it's also got some sedimentation in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| That, I believe, discharges onto Mr. Hall's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11384)|
| 3:09:47| and part of the challenge here is that I think at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| we can ensure that he'll get only clean water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11390)|
| 3:09:53| but I am concerned about the volume that he may eventually get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11393)|
| 3:09:56| and he's concerned about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11396)|
| 3:09:57| That's part of that equation that's harder to sort out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| until after everything is in and constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| and we see, again, as I told Mr. Hall and his neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11404)|
| 3:10:08| a set of plans is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| Even with the best of engineering, it is a set of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| and the net result of post-construction is a little harder to judge until it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| Where does this water that flows across this property towards his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| where does it dump to to eventually drain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11421)|
| 3:10:24| I would have to defer either to Leo or Mr. Warren about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| I actually don't know, once it drains off Mr. Hall's property, where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11429)|
| 3:10:37| Leo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| Leo LeCamere, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| After construction, there's only supposed to be about three-tenths of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| draining to the 12-inch cross drain that goes onto Mr. Hall's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11445)|
| 3:10:50| The majority of the drainage is supposed to go east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| The east drainage is supposed to go to the ditch on the north side of the road there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11453)|
| 3:11:01| and then there's another detention basin on the far east and west that that water is supposed to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11461)|
| 3:11:09| and the only thing is about three-tenths of an acre that's supposed to go to the 12-inch culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| What has been the failure from the systems that are in place until the finality is completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11474)|
| 3:11:24| I see the sites before development, and I review the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11484)|
| 3:11:30| The plan was to be diverted east and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11490)|
| 3:11:35| and then it goes to the inspectors who are supposed to make sure that it gets in per the approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11495)|
| 3:11:40| A lot of times we have a plan that shows the water being directed to its ultimate place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11500)|
| 3:11:49| but getting from when you first break ground into that finished state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11509)|
| 3:11:54| if you get a lot of rain, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11514)|
| 3:11:58| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11518)|
| 3:12:01| Commissioner Smith, let me just at least introduce Brad Warren, who supervises construction services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11521)|
| 3:12:06| He supervises the five site inspectors that go out and look at the subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11526)|
| 3:12:11| So Leo handles the plans review side in Chris's department on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11531)|
| 3:12:16| and Brad handles the construction site in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| Brad came to us from the consulting side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| He has a master's in civil engineering and has done a fine job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11541)|
| 3:12:24| so he can probably speak to the specific sources of failure better than anybody here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11544)|
| 3:12:29| because he's been the guy on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11551)|
| 3:12:34| This is Brad Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| I'm with Knox County Engineering Public Works, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11555)|
| 3:12:39| Could you repeat the question, I guess, that maybe I think you asked Leo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11559)|
| 3:12:44| What has been the failures in the temporary systems that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11564)|
| 3:12:48| until we get to the final stage of completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11568)|
| 3:12:52| The way the site is laid out, the road, the entrance road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11572)|
| 3:12:57| comes down onto Hickory Crest Road or Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11577)|
| 3:13:00| The drainage, the county drainage ditch along Hickory Creek has just been there forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11580)|
| 3:13:06| whenever that site was just a pasture field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| So now that we've developed it, we've paved it, we have that impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11589)|
| 3:13:14| when it rains and, of course, the lots that are graded out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| all that drains and comes down into the entrance road to the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11597)|
| 3:13:21| and comes into that ditch, which has the culvert that actually dumps out onto Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11601)|
| 3:13:28| So that is all draining into, running down the curb line, going into the ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11608)|
| 3:13:33| and it's flowing right into the cross drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11613)|
| 3:13:37| So there's a lot more increased volume as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| And I think that that's what Mr. Hall is concerned about is the volume of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11620)|
| 3:13:45| because before, you know, across the street was just a gradual pasture land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| All that rain infiltrated or slowed down through the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| whereas now it's, and once it gets vegetated, it'll get better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| but that's not where we're at now in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| We're in the worst time because all the rain that hits that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| even when it hits the ground, is not vegetated ground, so it all runs off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11645)|
| 3:14:10| Then it goes to the road, it all runs off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| It all goes to Mr. Hall's property through this culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11653)|
| 3:14:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11663)|
| 3:14:24| I'd like to thank Mr. Hall for hanging around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11664)|
| 3:14:27| I have a, it would be a similar problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| I've already mentioned it to Leo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| We've got a subdivision going into my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| Every one of the nine to the ten, it's about nine acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| it's going to be about 18 to 20 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11678)|
| 3:14:41| Every lot will drain downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| There's no way for it to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11684)|
| 3:14:45| We've already got a drain problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| It goes into Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| Tennessee River backs up, so does Little River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11689)|
| 3:14:51| Little River backs up in Stock Creek in the people's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| I've got neighbors now that are losing yards because development has come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11695)|
| 3:15:00| and I don't know the answer to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11700)|
| 3:15:02| but we've got to take consideration of people downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| Just because, and I want development, I want the houses, I want the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| but we're destroying people's property downstream, and I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11711)|
| 3:15:15| If I did, I would surely give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11715)|
| 3:15:18| We've got to take into consideration when you've got nine acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11718)|
| 3:15:22| and you're putting 20 houses on an asphalt roof and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| you're going to have a drainage problem downstream even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| I'm south, I'm downstream of all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11729)|
| 3:15:32| so when I get the plans, this is what we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11732)|
| 3:15:36| I agree, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| Water is going to drain downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| and the more you develop, the more water that's going to go downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| I couldn't agree more, but by the time I get the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| this is what we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| It's management at best to try to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11748)|
| 3:15:51| Maybe you can answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11751)|
| 3:15:54| They'll come before us and we give them one, two, five, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| but the tension ponds, the tension pond on this and probably on Mr. Hall's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11759)|
| 3:16:05| it should be a lot larger than normal because we know we're going to have a drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| Can we as Knox County or Knox County engineering say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11770)|
| 3:16:14| hey, the tension pond has got to be this big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| and you're going to lose two or three houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| Tough luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| That's one of the tougher questions, Commissioner, so I'll just have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11783)|
| 3:16:28| We currently observe a 100-year storm event standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11788)|
| 3:16:34| The request has been pending to us from the development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| and I think it will eventually find its way to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| to go to a 25-year standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| The larger ponds occupy more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| They reduce the amount of property that's available for development and sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11808)|
| 3:16:53| The larger ponds do offer a greater measure of protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| but that is a very difficult discussion with the development community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11816)|
| 3:17:02| as property has grown more expensive and harder to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| and I will tell you that the space we occupy these days is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11826)|
| 3:17:09| You'll remember last month or the month before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11829)|
| 3:17:12| we had a family here on a development complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11832)|
| 3:17:16| and while I was driving out to meet Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11836)|
| 3:17:21| and a number of members of the staff in their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| I got 20 minutes from a local grading contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11845)|
| 3:17:29| about how ridiculously strict our regulations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11849)|
| 3:17:33| and how ridiculously strict our enforcement is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11853)|
| 3:17:36| and I arrive at the residence house, and Mr. Schoonmaker remembers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| He said something to me about our lax regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11861)|
| 3:17:44| and that is the space in which we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11864)|
| 3:17:47| If you come up with that answer, I hope it's soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11867)|
| 3:17:53| We're working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| I'd ask you to remember this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| as you do take complaints and grievance from both sides of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11878)|
| 3:18:02| This is some of the trickiest space in which we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11882)|
| 3:18:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| Since you're there, because of our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| that Brad was there as well at that subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| are things progressing better, Mr. Warren, in the last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11893)|
| 3:18:20| As far as I'm aware of, I haven't heard any complaints other than from the rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11900)|
| 3:18:26| the neighbor that has some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| and as far as from the neighbors in the back, I haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11909)|
| 3:18:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker, we do have the contract in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11914)|
| 3:18:37| with the consulting firm to do the area drainage study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11917)|
| 3:18:41| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11923)|
| 3:18:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11924)|
| 3:18:45| Dwight, it seems that our end engineering final product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11925)|
| 3:18:48| is usually pretty adequate to handle these kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| and the majority of our problems come in the development stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| Is there anything we can do to create larger space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11934)|
| 3:18:59| and safer runoff during development stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11939)|
| 3:19:03| that still allows a developer to develop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| Let me capture the question and think about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11948)|
| 3:19:12| Commissioner, one of the things that is worth noting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| is this is sort of an anomalous summer from a weather standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| When you think about silt fence as a standard perimeter control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| for erosion around a construction site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| it's typically engineered to a five-year storm event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11963)|
| 3:19:26| and we've been having 25- and close to 50-year storm events routinely all summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11966)|
| 3:19:31| And so a treatment like a silt fence that's rated for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| is likely going to have some failure in a 25-year event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11976)|
| 3:19:39| So we want to make sure we take sort of a long-term view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11979)|
| 3:19:43| of what we can normally expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| Chris Granju has been working on an evaluative tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| with the UT Water Resources Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| that also allows certain credits that might encourage development practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11992)|
| 3:19:57| that will help us in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| and that's a work in progress, but it is in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| So we'll continue to work at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12002)|
| 3:20:05| One thing I could use and will probably seek to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12005)|
| 3:20:09| is add more boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| Brad does not have enough personnel doing the inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12011)|
| 3:20:14| and with the volume of sites that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12014)|
| 3:20:18| we continue to struggle to keep up with things from a staffing standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12018)|
| 3:20:23| Frankly, just finding good people has been our issue of late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12023)|
| 3:20:26| and if I pick up another inspector this year, I think that will help considerably too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12026)|
| 3:20:31| And as you mentioned, the events this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| I live in a piece of property that had in the past been prone to flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12034)|
| 3:20:40| until TDOT had done some improvements with a culvert underneath Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12040)|
| 3:20:46| and I've experienced two overflows this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12046)|
| 3:20:49| and the area I live in completely developed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12049)|
| 3:20:52| and we haven't had an overflow in probably six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| since they made some of those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| And we would like long-term to take a look at some regional storage projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12058)|
| 3:21:02| and things like that that are municipally driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| I will tell you that I think the county's role in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| is going to have to increase as density increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12068)|
| 3:21:13| so that you may have more things that are municipally owned and maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12073)|
| 3:21:17| as opposed to what's within the subdivisions right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12077)|
| 3:21:20| is all residentially owned and maintained by the HOAs and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Those are the maintenance covenants that commission votes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| We control things within the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| But, for instance, in Commissioner Daley's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| some years ago we did a regional storage project in Arrowhead subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12091)|
| 3:21:34| Over time, more projects of that nature may become a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12094)|
| 3:21:39| We give that some thought as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12099)|
| 3:21:42| Mr. Howell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| Mr. Chair, Commissioner Smith, thank you for bringing up two great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12105)|
| 3:21:49| First, of which that culvert was built roughly 35 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| to accommodate road runoff from rain, not a 50-foot hydraulic berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12114)|
| 3:21:59| that has now been erected across from a house that Commissioner Brantley alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12119)|
| 3:22:04| They are building walls, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| and there's a new subdivision just being excavated now further east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12126)|
| 3:22:11| on Hardin Valley Road proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| They're doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12133)|
| 3:22:14| They're going in, they're making plateaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| I understand all that high-density, low-impact housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| but that water has to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12139)|
| 3:22:22| And when you ask where does all this water go to, it goes to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12142)|
| 3:22:27| Again, my affectionately coded downstream neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12147)|
| 3:22:31| There are some pictures, one of them with a red roof shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12151)|
| 3:22:34| That's their backyard, and it's several hundred feet from my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12154)|
| 3:22:38| And that is far more than three-tenths of an acre of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| that passes through that culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| I get that in two minutes when it rains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12164)|
| 3:22:47| That picture there was taken in a matter of seconds after it started to rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| There's nowhere for that water to go when it cascades down that entry road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| except into my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12175)|
| 3:22:59| Clear water or sediment water, I'm really uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| that being the new norm for my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12184)|
| 3:23:06| which had never been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12186)|
| 3:23:07| I've been there for about 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| Again, that culvert was designed for road runoff 35, 40 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12189)|
| 3:23:14| not a 50-50 housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| Thank you for your attention on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12200)|
| 3:23:21| Just briefly, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| This is a problem, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| Hardin Valley is going to have to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| They're going to have to fix the traffic right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| My neighbor, Dr. Harlan, had a beautiful three-acre lake stocked with fish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12210)|
| 3:23:35| that in the last year has turned into a retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| from all the building that's going on upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| It's just solid mud, and he's got a big investment in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12222)|
| 3:23:47| It's just something has to be done along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| But thank you for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12231)|
| 3:23:52| Thank you for sitting here for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| We feel your pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12234)|
| 3:23:57| Thank you. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12237)|
| 3:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12238)|
| 3:24:00| Seeing no further discussion, moving to item 81, page 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12240)|
| 3:24:05| spread of record of the Knox County Mayor's order appointing Darla Berdahl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12245)|
| 3:24:12| to the Board of Commissioners of the First Utility District of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12252)|
| 3:24:18| Spread of record will be read into the permanent record next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12258)|
| 3:24:26| There are two or three things I'd like to bring to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12266)|
| 3:24:28| One has to do with the Legacy Parks October the 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12268)|
| 3:24:35| There have been a couple of commissioners signed up to attend the Legacy Parks lunch on October the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12275)|
| 3:24:44| If you intend to attend, please contact the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12284)|
| 3:24:54| You have to specifically say to take that from your discretionary fund for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12294)|
| 3:25:07| The Development Corporation met this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| Commissioners Thomas and Commissioner Smith and myself attended the Development Corporation meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| I have copies of the agenda and the minutes in my possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12317)|
| 3:25:21| If you would like to look at the work of the Development Corporation, please contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12321)|
| 3:25:27| I believe I can hand that off to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12327)|
| 3:25:31| There's also a letter that only affects four districts on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12331)|
| 3:25:40| District 2, 4, 6, and 8 have terms coming to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12340)|
| 3:25:47| Please take notice of the Board of Zoning Appeals, District 2, 4, 6, and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12347)|
| 3:25:56| Also, my fellow commissioners, some are attending what might just be a few hours from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12356)|
| 3:26:02| the open panel discussion breakfast in Farragut that's tomorrow morning at 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12362)|
| 3:26:15| So remember that for those of you that have signed up, 7.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12375)|
| 3:26:21| And then my fellow commissioner, this looks like it's just a bunch of short names, Ed and Bob and Sam and Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12381)|
| 3:26:29| Fill me in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| We don't use our last names with our next monthly Ed and Bob night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12391)|
| 3:26:35| It's going to be at Sam and Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| This is in the Aspen Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12399)|
| 3:26:40| Next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12400)|
| 3:26:41| Oh, no, this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12402)|
| 3:26:43| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12403)|
| 3:26:44| Thanks for clearing it up for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| It's just Wednesday night, 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| It's 11,110 Kingston Pike in the Aspen Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12407)|
| 3:26:52| Come on by Sam and Andes, talk to us, all elected officials, citizens, everybody's welcome to come by, talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12412)|
| 3:26:59| and also have one of their great hamburgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12419)|
| 3:27:02| Other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12422)|
| 3:27:06| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| Get off the button again, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| Friday at 9.30 I have made a point with Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| Anyone is welcome to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12436)|
| 3:27:19| I will send an e-mail to Drew to publicize at 48-hour notice, 9.30 Friday at the health center, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12439)|
| 3:27:30| August the 29th is ask the commissioner with myself and Amber Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12450)|
| 3:27:36| And September the 21st, the South Knox Republican Club is going to have Senator May Beavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12456)|
| 3:27:43| So if you would like to see and talk to Senator May Beavers, September 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12463)|
| 3:27:51| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12473)|
| 3:27:54| And on that day that May Beavers is going to be in South Knoxville, if you didn't want to go there that early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12474)|
| 3:28:00| you can come out to North Knoxville Republican Club and hear her out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12480)|
| 3:28:04| So anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12484)|
| 3:28:11| Seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12491)|
| 3:28:17| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170821?start=12497)|
