| 0:25:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I just wanted to bring up kind of some of what we had talked about on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| You know, just that a lot of our families and parents are not exactly happy with the early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| And I'm curious if we have any other members that would be interested in potentially taking those off of the calendar for this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1527)|
| 0:25:41| Because I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Well, this is actually for the next year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| So are you talking about for the 2025-2026?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| So I think that I would, I mean, I spoke about that the other night that I'm interested in looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| I really think that I would, I don't know if we want to make that decision or if we should just ask that they take it back to the Teacher Advisory Council and the principals and revisit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1565)|
| 0:26:17| Because I think there's obviously a disconnect somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| And I mean, I wouldn't mind hearing other board members, but there's obviously a disconnect somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Because what I'm hearing is very different than what, you know, we talked about the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| And I would be happy to hear what Dr. Wilson has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Because I've heard from some people who are also not a fan of the days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| But I would like to maybe send that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| And Dr. Wilson, I know you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| No, I'd just say I'm happy to follow up however you all feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| And we talked about Teacher Council, Family Council the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| I talked about, too, if we wanted to do a broader reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Governor and I have talked about potential through REA of designing a few survey items that we could send to families, to administrators, and to teachers to kind of grasp a full picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1618)|
| 0:27:07| And I'd just like to say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| You know, I did go back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| I said the other night I was not in the seat at the time that they had these conversations and did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| And I did go back and look at the board comments from when we talked about it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| We certainly did propose it as a pilot effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| And, you know, I think the reality is we've, you know, over the last two years we've had nine of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| So we've had 18 hours of participation in what those activities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Certainly in the first year some opportunity to refine those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And so I think we certainly should look at the structure of how we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| But also be attuned that, you know, again, where it came from originally and the why behind it hasn't probably changed that much in that we do need time and opportunities for our teachers to engage in professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1661)|
| 0:27:51| We may have to figure out what a different strategy for that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| And I think we're open to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| And, again, if we can use some surveys and things to paint a better picture of, you know, what that might be, then I think we're obviously open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| Yeah, I mean, I think that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| And, you know, we obviously have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| And I know Dr. Reiser has his light on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| So we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| But we also have the 24-25 school year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| So they're on the calendar for 24-25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| So this is obviously even the calendar beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| So, you know, I think it's difficult for the principals to have a certain viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| And they know what they want to accomplish in their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| So, you know, we just have a lot of different agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| I mean, I think everybody has their own perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| So I think a deeper dive could be helpful to see what the big picture is and what makes the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1717)|
| 0:28:47| I think it would be good to revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Are we talking about just 425-26, or are we asking the staff to also look at next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| I think I would like to extend the ask to next year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| And also since that kind of thing is a working condition, I'd like to see it discussed with the BECA team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Dr. Reiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| I'll say to Ms. Owen's comment, too, it actually has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| And that was one of the, I think, last month's BECA meeting we were talking through some of that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| just talking about what I think we heard from that was really working with that team to get clear expectations across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| I know Dr. Wilson addressed it there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I just want to reiterate something that Dr. Wilson said, because I think I know the guy who was in that seat when it passed on the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| So I just want to say it was with a lot of research, and that's the part you guys are saying, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| I know Dr. Adams has been at Oak Ridge for, had been at Oak Ridge a long time before coming here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| and there are systems that do that on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| And, you know, when we were exploring why that was, it was, as Dr. Wilson said, like the work doesn't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| Like, you know, what needs to be done from planning for some of the small learning community things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| from some of the PLCs, professional learning communities, the school-based things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| You know, district doesn't use that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Schools do to do what they need to do for their, you know, they all have school plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| and it's like they don't really have any time during the year to work on the initiatives they have to deliver on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| So I think that's kind of what was born out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| We had heard a lot at that time that there's not time in the day to get all this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| And so although we're hearing, you know, maybe from some parents and things that totally agree we should dive into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| I think we just need to know, like, that work then has to be done at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| And, you know, this isn't a tradeoff of, like, a shorter calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| You know, that will now be instructional time, and they'll be teaching during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| So I just want to make sure as we do go into it that everybody has a full understanding of what that tradeoff is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| because I think there have been times, like, working to get to this, and we do hear lots of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| I know I see my friend Paul in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| We talk about, you know, time and teacher schedules every day and trying to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| So no doubt I echo what you say, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| We need to get better at defining what that is so that all schools are clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| but at the same time the need for time comes across a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| So, again, we'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| I just want to make sure that we see the big picture, too, because we'll start hearing the others, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| It will come back Tuesday when there's time for teachers to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Yeah, I totally agree with that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Dr. Wilson, I just have another ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| While you're formulating that survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| if you would ask families how they feel about a full day rather than a half day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| a lot of what I'm hearing is frustration with trying to schedule around that half day from families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| and from teachers feeling like it's sort of a wasted instructional day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| So if we could consider some other way to maybe move that around, I think that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| It would impact fewer total days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| And, you know, Dr. Ryswyk, to your point, you know, we did talk extensively about it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and, you know, there's obviously value and there's professional development that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| So I do think it's a combination of a disconnect of expectations and what the day is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| And, you know, I said to one teacher, in a perfect world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| the principal and the teachers would really work together on the best use of that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| so that the teachers really feel like it is valuable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| And if the teachers feel like it's valuable time, then they're able to say to the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| I know this is an imposition, but I think it's really helpful and valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| So I think there's a lot of disconnect maybe in that realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| that principals feel like they need this professional development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| but teachers feel like they need something else or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| So I think revisiting it is probably a good path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| Yeah, and that's why I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Yeah, what's the disconnect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| What are we looking to get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| And that's why I'm not comfortable making...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| I don't think personally that we need to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| I think that we need some, you know, kind of evidence-based decision-making in this realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| And I think based on what you find, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| we may need to make a calendar change for the coming school year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| I agree with that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| That was a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| So there's a motion on the floor made by Dr. Butler, and Ms. Owen seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| Do you all want to withdraw your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| Yeah, so good to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| 11C, approve fiscal year 2024 general purpose budget line item transfers for January 1 through March 31, 2024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| in the amount of $303,712.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| Motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| 11D, approve charter school application review team substitutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| Motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| I'm wondering what this would look like if we deferred it for one month since Mr. Triplett voiced some concerns about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| and he is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| I mean, is that a, Dr. Reislick, is that an issue with staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| I think, thank you, Ms. Christie, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| I think, I'll let Dr. Wilson speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I think there are some trainings that are set up, but, you know, how set in stone those are, I'll let him answer that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| So I did speak with Ms. Nixon, and there is a training for the team as they move into doing, you know, the process for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| and had spent some time with those team members kind of thinking through summer plans and vacations and all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| The training was set originally for earlier in May, but because of the conflicts of interest and the need to change the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| it has now been pushed back to May the 20th is what the date is set for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So certainly if we deferred, then that would be a date that would have to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| It is not probably an absolute deal breaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| It might result in multiple trainings for smaller groups of people having to occur to accommodate schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| but that's where we are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| I think my, one of my concerns is this is always a politically charged debate when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2160)|
| 0:36:11| I know that there, I mean, what the review committee does is pretty straightforward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| But, you know, with that concern being brought up, is it going to turn into an issue if they bring back a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2178)|
| 0:36:29| That's all that, I mean, I think either of the people that were suggested would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| You know, and I don't know how other board members feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| I mean, I'm fine with moving forward, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Just to see how everybody else feels about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| So basically it would cost more time if we did, if we made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| So I mean, based on that, I think that we should just go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| I agree, but I appreciate you bringing those concerns up and talking through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Okay, seeing no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| 11E, discussion and possible action on resolution affirming that school security officers and school resource officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| will continue to be the armed personnel on school campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| And we do have several public speakers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| I'm going to play the role of Mr. Triplett tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Our first public speaker is Mr. Schofield, Bill Schofield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| My name is Bill Schofield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| I have a child in Knox County Schools, and my wife is an employee of Knox County Schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| I have a vested interest in this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I also have a long list of firearm certifications, protective service experience, and marksmanship credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| which I don't have enough time to list now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I want it understood that what I'm about to say is not an indictment of any of the local law enforcement organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| I'm a graduate of the KPD Citizens Academy, and I've gone on ride-alongs with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| I have friends and family in law enforcement, and I support them fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| If the police are honest, however, they'll tell you that they cannot guarantee the safety of schoolchildren or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| They'll do their best, but they cannot make assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| This is what we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| When every other safeguard has failed, do you want the victims to have an option or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Your resolutions are going to prevent victims from having options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| The only thing they'll be able to do if all the other options fail is cower and pray that someone with a gun shows up in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| In a mass shooting, the average is one victim shot every eight seconds until the perpetrator is stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| If the police have a three-minute response time, the amount of time I'm allowed to speak, and a very rapid response time at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| that means that somebody will be shot, more than 22 people will be shot in three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| Currently, you have a number of schools with only one officer protecting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| This is a single point of failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| When that officer is compromised, and I hope that never happens, the shooter is free to do whatever they want, shooting someone every eight seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| SROs and police are a great deterrent, but they're also well-identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| They'll be the first people targeted by a determined shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| After that, you have nothing left but to wait for backup, time for a killer to kill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| If you think that won't happen, I submit the Uvalde and Parkland, Florida, incidences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| In Parkland, the shooter was unopposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| He kept shooting until he got bored and went to McDonald's for a snack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| This is what you're going to put in place with the resolutions tonight, unfettered access to targets, my wife, my kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| The criminals have several advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| They pick the time and the place, the level of force that you will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| There's nothing you can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| But what they don't know is the level of response that will be brought against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| If it's only a uniformed officer, then they do know the level of response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| If it's anonymous capable people, you significantly increase the risk to the perpetrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| Why would you give away the one advantage you can have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Do any of you know how many other states permit guns in schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| It's 33, more than half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| Do you know why you never hear about accidental or rampage shootings that that encourages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| Because it never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| If it did, you'd surely hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| The presence of trained, capable, armed adults in schools reduces the likelihood of a mass shooting incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| You want to vote against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| You're effectively voting for more mass shooting opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| Don't make a bad choice based on fear, feelings, or emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Make a good choice based on facts and logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| Next up, Lori Heffler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Lori?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Heisler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Heisler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| My name is Lori Heisler, and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Thank you, members of the board, for allowing me the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| My name is Lori Heisler, and I am a proud community member of Knoxville and a lifelong children's advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| As a young girl, school was always my safe haven, especially during times of adversity at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Raised by a teenage mother with my birth father battling drug addiction and incarceration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| and facing the turmoil of divorce multiple times throughout my childhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| I experienced a handful of adverse childhood experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Statistically, I should have never graduated high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Yet, like many of the students in Knox County School District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| school is where I found my refuge and felt safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| And because of that, I persevered, ultimately becoming the first in my family to graduate high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| the first to attend and graduate college, and eventually obtaining a master's degree in educational leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| From my early days as an elementary teacher to becoming a school administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| and now in my current role as a trauma-informed school consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| I've dedicated almost three decades of advocating for the mental health and safety and well-being of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| Taking a firm stance against teachers, against arming teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| aligns with this district's commitment to being trauma-informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Research consistently shows that the presence of more guns in schools increases student anxiety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| and is not a trauma-informed response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| Our district has invested tremendous resources in becoming trauma-informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| and improving students' mental health, and arming teachers conflicts with these efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| It is evident that this board agrees that arming teachers is unnecessary in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| Any hesitation or reluctance to issue a clear resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| undermines the trust to our students, teachers, families, and stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| Passing a resolution with clear and firm language provides the opportunity for this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| to demonstrate unwavering confidence in our school resource officers and school security personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| Furthermore, as a seasoned educator, I can attest that a firm resolution against arming teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| will support our efforts in attracting and retaining high-quality educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| allowing teachers to focus on their core responsibilities without the added concern of carrying firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| will ensure that we attract and retain the best educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| And finally, it is crucial for this board to serve as a model for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| by demonstrating the willingness to listen to each other and to your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| by communicating a clear message to the Knox County community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| that we have full confidence in our current school security and safety personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| and do not see a need to arm teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| We can inspire trust and unity within our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Next, Erin Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Erin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2672)|
| 0:44:43| Erin Keck, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| I am here to support the resolution that Ms. Byke and Ms. Owen have drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2686)|
| 0:44:53| I read over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I think that Ms. Christie's resolution really doesn't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| It just says that we're going to continue to have the resource officers be the armed school personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| That's like saying we're just going to continue to have the cafeteria workers serve food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| It's not really a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| It's the wording of the only armed personnel in Knox County schools because that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| I mean, otherwise we're just stating facts of what's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| I have three different roles in my life that give me this opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| and I'll start with the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| I am a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I'm a preschool teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| And I could not imagine myself or my coworkers being armed at my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Just even thinking of that is terrifying to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| That's not my role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| That's not my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| I don't have armed school security at my preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| But I do not feel that we would be safer with guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I never feel that more guns is the answer to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| Also, I'm a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| As a parent of a child in a Knox County school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| I would not feel comfortable with her being in a classroom with teachers that have weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| I don't know these teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| I don't know what their intentions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| We've had teachers, the majority of them in Knox County, are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| We've had teachers that have made some pretty poor decisions in classrooms in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| and I would hate to think about that happening with a loaded firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Terrifying as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| My third role is as a community member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| I live on the same street as an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| and I would not like to think of my neighborhood all of a sudden allowing 50 additional people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| to start bringing guns into our neighborhood and on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| That is another thing that is scary to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I would even take it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| I think that Chief Perriard is a very, very competent man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| He has a great team with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| The school security and the school resource officers, I think that's all we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| Let's not forget that there's still a family that is mourning the loss of their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| after someone with a legal right to have a gun came into Austin East High School and shot him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| If that person had knowledge of the child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| if that person had been someone that regularly was at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| maybe Anthony Thompson Jr. would not be dead right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| But I cannot imagine that a solution for safety is more guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Samantha Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Samantha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| My name is Samantha Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| I'm here as a very concerned parent of two children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| I watched this law get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| I watched the legislative sessions, the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| and I understand that in some rural areas in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| there might not be law enforcement in every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| but there definitely are law enforcement officers in every school in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| and we don't need to have teachers that have guns in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| As a parent, it is very important to me that this board says very firmly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| that we will not arm our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Anything less than that is saying that you're planning to allow our teachers to carry guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2904)|
| 0:48:34| Our students, families, and, frankly, our teachers and staff deserve a firm understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| of where you stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| We have trained law enforcement officers on our campuses to protect our students and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| and that is very clearly the preference of the majority of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2933)|
| 0:49:02| In February of 2010, a teacher shot a principal and assistant principal in a Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2942)|
| 0:49:16| We shouldn't forget that, a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| It doesn't matter what training people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| or what goes into it before we let somebody bring a gun into a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| if we're allowing people to bring guns into school that aren't law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| We shouldn't allow other people who aren't law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| to bring guns into our schools with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Please send a firm message to everyone in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| and tell us what you really want is for our teachers not to be armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=2999)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Andre Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Andre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I hope I pronounced your last name right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| No, you won a few beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| All right, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| All right, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| So I'll be pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| I wasn't prepared to speak because I thought I'd sign up yesterday, so I signed up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| I'll be pretty cut and dry about it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| I ran for school board around 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| and I was asked around armed teachers after the Parkland shooting in Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| and my response was immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I said kids will get shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| It sounded hyperbolic, right, because I was running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Sometimes those sound bites gather some information, I mean some attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| but I wasn't too far off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Disparities are already bad with school discipline and school outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| The gun violence, which I'm also addressing in my professional life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| that will also be the case, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| There's not a lot of teachers, teacher advocacy groups, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| not a lot of parents, parents groups are supporting armed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| That's just like the facts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| There's no feelings about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Not a lot of people, the stakeholders, the teachers, the parents, the children are with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| Also, what the previous speaker said about the principal that was shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| that was my PE teacher from Silverwood Green, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| So with this proposal to armed teachers, it further illustrates the prisoner school pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3104)|
| 0:51:53| What it does is illustrate to children that there is no safe place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| particularly where some people will not be informed about armed teachers in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| So it creates that unease and that trauma, as the previous speaker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| and increases more anxiety and more tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| You're already in a tense situation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| In Columbine, there were SROs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| And currently with Knox County security, I'm sure there is already a protocol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| and procedures about how to address any kind of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| How an armed teacher will factor in that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| It may mess up their game plan, their protocols, their policy, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| So if something happens, are they a part of that protocol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| Are they a part of those procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| It may create more chaos than solutions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| So I agree with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| I propose a resolution to firmly stand that we as Knox County is against armed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3169)|
| 0:52:58| We have SROs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| We have security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| They work fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| And we should be about the students and the teachers and the parents who all oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| So let's stand behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Christy Taft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Ms. Taft, did you want to speak to these resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| The topic was not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| We'll call you at the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Sean Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3208)|
| 0:53:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| If you'll state your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Sean Murphy, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| I have a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I grew up in Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I lived 20 minutes from Sandy Hook when it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| I'm privy to things that are not public because I have a connection in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| And what I'm seeing in the public comment tonight is the same disturbing problems that Connecticut had in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| The first thing is I've been to two school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| I've heard teachers stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I wouldn't trust many of them with a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| They don't trust themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| We shouldn't trust them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| The law is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| People should be picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| You don't pick everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| I don't have the training to defend a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| I wouldn't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I'd take the training if I were a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| The first, and it really concerns me because Connecticut didn't learn from its mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| They tore the little history on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| They tore the school down, made the people sign a nondisclosure agreement, tore the whole thing down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| and covered the whole thing up and wouldn't have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| I lived in Newtown for a year, and I left because I couldn't stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| There was an aura in that place because the community never talked to each other about this horrible event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| Here are the problems that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Number one, if you support a resolution where you don't want anyone but police armed in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| here's what I'd like you to do for the school board members and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Put a sign in your front yard that says, my home has no guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Watch what happens because the people who look at this rationally, not emotionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| knows you're going to have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Gun-free zones are where 94% of mass shootings happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Look up John Lott, L-O-T-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| He knows way more about this than I do, and he's way smarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| The mere fact of eliminating a gun-free zone, meaning I'm asking you to do the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| Pass a resolution that says guns are allowed in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| You will not speak in public as to who's allowed, and you don't have to allow anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| The mere fact of eliminating the gun-free zone will make a big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| because shooters target schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| They target gun-free zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Aurora, Colorado, when the guy shot up the movie theater, drove to go shoot one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| Newtown, Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Another problem you're facing is the Castle Rock decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| Police are not required to defend us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| If there's one SRO and he's on the other side of the building or in the bathroom, you have no defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| I hope we never have this problem here like I watched this go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| The principal lived in the town I was living in, and I had to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| We had to stand out in the street in front of her funeral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| because a bunch of people were trying to protest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| We want to make sure that we have the element of surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| So you can pass a resolution that says guns are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| You can just privately say we're not arming anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| That's one thing we need to do and be responsible and stop being so emotional about guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Lauren?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Is Lauren here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Oh, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| We were just talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| So you didn't write down what you wanted to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| Is it this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| That is for general public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| We'll see you at the end, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Also, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| Donna, did you want to speak on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Just state your name, county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| My name is Donna Trapassi, Knox County, formerly from the suburbs of New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| So I do also have a different stance on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| I was very disheartened and disappointed in the stance taken on this subject of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3458)|
| 0:57:47| being armed by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| I'm going to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| I was disheartened and disappointed in the stance taken by this board against teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| and faculty defending themselves and our students against acts of violence and mass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| shootings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| We have worked to remove pornographic and murderous material in KCS school libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| You have fought us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Only when you were backed into a corner by public revelation of your own KCS computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| servers, banning the very material we have begged you to voluntarily remove, did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| And it was minimal and non-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| You provide our children with instructions on mass shootings, with graphic comic book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| style novels titled Assassination Classroom, and you refuse to remove these books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3519)|
| 0:58:48| Every morning, parents send their children off with a hope and a prayer that they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| They pray the school on the news won't be their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| They pray the names on the next memorial won't be the names of their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| Lives are more important than feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| Lives are more important than your electability in the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| You have an opportunity to potentially save lives by empowering those who are qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| and most importantly, choose to protect others to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Don't waste it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Thank you, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| Sherry Super, did you want to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| You're at the end also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| And then Ellen Lee, you didn't write down what you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Do you want to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Come on up, Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| My name is Ellen Lee, and I am...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Let me see what I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| I am a resident of Knox County, born and raised here, moved away, came back, retired here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| and I have siblings, grandchildren, nephews, nieces that have attended Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| Knox City schools from one end of the county to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| I'm very invested in being invested in my children and my grandkids and everybody that go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3617)|
| 1:00:27| Let me say first that I really want to thank Dr. Resnick for his comment the day after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3627)|
| 1:00:37| that the bill was passed into law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| I felt like that gave a lot of people in the community a sense of reassurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| I think it was a major move at a major time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I think what I'm here today is to ask that the school board basically give Dr. Resnick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| support, give the community the support, and give them the definitive answer that we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3658)|
| 1:01:07| Dr. Resnick, we support not arming our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| This being Teachers Appreciation Week, I'm thinking, dear Lord, give the teachers a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| Anyway, I just ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| I want to say I'm pretty sure, I know I am, older than anybody on this board and probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3685)|
| 1:01:34| anybody else in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| That being said, age with all the aches and pains also comes with a little knowledge and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| a little judgment of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| I truly believe that Dr. Resnick, from what I have seen him do in the past years, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| new police chief and our sheriff, train the people that they have under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3713)|
| 1:02:02| On the fact that they too, all those people, the policemen, the sheriffs, and the deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| they have children in these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| I totally believe that they will take every fiber of their being to protect our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| I believe that they, and it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| I'll also tell you something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| As far as Sandy Hook, I know millions of men, women in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3743)|
| 1:02:32| I'm standing here today in this shirt because of Sandy Hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| So, there has something good coming to try to do gun safety in schools and homes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| communities that came out of Sandy Hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| That is our hope for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| I'm asking that you please adopt this resolution by Board Member Beigert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| That concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Now, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| I will keep this very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| As I stated Monday night, the resolution I submitted was written in a manner not to be politically charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3797)|
| 1:03:28| I do not oppose this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| I'm thankful that it grants local control, which is something this board is constantly asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| And not all school districts have the resources we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| I mean, we do have armed officers in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Multiple armed officers in many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| It recognizes the millions we've invested in security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| It recognizes our tremendous partnerships with KPD and the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3834)|
| 1:04:02| And the dedication of our school security officers in Chief Perriard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| And finally, again, as a mom of a Michigan State student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| it's a reflection of my gratitude to those who do run toward the danger when we have a loved one in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3852)|
| 1:04:21| And I'm sorry if my resolution is not strong enough for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| But, you know, sometimes to get a resolution or something like this passed, you have to meet in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| I hate resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| The fact that I submitted one is my middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| That is my compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| And that is my resolution is the only resolution that I will be voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| And I am happy with it the way it is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| And that's really all I have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| I do thank Ms. Christie and Ms. Byke both for the effort and Ms. Owens, what part she played to bring us resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3898)|
| 1:05:09| I do believe in resolutions for the purpose of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| It says what you're going to do, what you believe in, until you change your mind, until something changes your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| So I do think resolutions serve a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| I don't think we need to have one on everything, but I think we need to have one on this one simply because the public has asked us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3924)|
| 1:05:32| I thank, once again, Ms. Christie for this resolution because it does support our personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3932)|
| 1:05:45| both that work for Knox County Schools and those that work for Knoxville Police Department and Knox County Sheriff Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3945)|
| 1:05:55| I do like most of the language, all the language that I see, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| but I do think that we need to have a specific statement that either we do or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3963)|
| 1:06:13| And I think that that's not here with that last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| So I move to amend this motion to insert in the now therefore be it resolved that Knox County Board of Education hereby affirms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3977)|
| 1:06:30| that certified law enforcement personnel are equipped to manage the safety and security of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3990)|
| 1:06:38| to maintain the highest possible standards for student safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| School security officers, school resource officers, and other law enforcement officers will continue to be the and insert only armed personnel on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4002)|
| 1:06:55| That is the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4015)|
| 1:07:06| Move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4026)|
| 1:07:17| So you vote on the amended motion first and then if that, you go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4037)|
| 1:07:28| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| Thank you Madam Chair. I could support that resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| We have heard what happens when a teacher takes a gun into one of our local schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| We know that to be true and we know that years later this board was still having to deal with what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4062)|
| 1:07:54| Not arming teachers does not mean that we're creating a gun free zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| We still have our armed officers. We are all supporting our armed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| That is what both of these resolutions do and I see no reason to not support our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| One thing I'd like to share with this board is that I have a relative who until recently worked at a facility for incarcerated youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4092)|
| 1:08:22| They were incarcerated for committing felonies and she was a teacher there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| These are teenagers who had committed murder and were incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| Her classes were ages 16 to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| In that facility they had no armed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| They had no armed guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| A medium security facility for teenagers who have committed felonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| They believed that those students were best served by not having arms in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| By not having armed teachers or armed guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4137)|
| 1:09:06| I think we need to really think about that and consider all of the times that we've had discussions about reasons we don't want to put fences around some of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4146)|
| 1:09:18| is because we don't want to have the feeling that it's like a prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| When we start arming multiple people in a school, we are creating that feeling much more than with a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4166)|
| 1:09:39| How our students feel about going to school every day matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| How parents feel about sending their students to school every day matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| How our teachers feel about going to school every day matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| I don't think anyone in this room wants to consider me being armed in a classroom with kindergarteners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4196)|
| 1:10:04| That's not something we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Our security officers are very well trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Significantly more than this law would allow for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| Hundreds of hours more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| We need to make a very firm statement so that there is no question about our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Reverend Butler, I appreciate the suggestion of the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Ms. Christie, I appreciate you taking the effort and Ms. Mike to get out ahead of this and try to help us make a statement and craft a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| Ms. Christie, I've been on the board going on four years and know the struggles we have sometimes as a board to be unified in our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4251)|
| 1:11:01| I could clearly see that was your attempt and this was to get something that could pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| That would be a statement out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I would assume, and I'm happy for you to correct me publicly too, but I would assume that the timing of this resolution is in direct response to the law that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4268)|
| 1:11:17| I would assume that if that law didn't get passed, this resolution wouldn't have been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| And so because of that, I think the resolution should at least in some way address the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4281)|
| 1:11:30| And I think as written, it does a great job speaking to the support that we have for our officers and for our security personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4290)|
| 1:11:38| And I think during like a law enforcement awareness week, that would have been a great resolution just to put during that one particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| But because of the timing of this, I think without that word only, I think all it is is a statement about how much we value our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4306)|
| 1:11:58| And I don't think that's what's needed in the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And I think the word only does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| And I would hope that by suggesting the word only, that that doesn't prevent us from passing it because I think that would speak to your initial concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4324)|
| 1:12:13| That we have such a hard time sometimes as a board passing a unified statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| And I would hope that that word only would not be the thing that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| And again, if this is something that you might have brought at another time, I'm happy to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| But I would assume that it was in direct response to the law that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| Not as an indictment against the law, but as a message related to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4354)|
| 1:12:43| Ms. Christie, I think your light was on next, even though your name's not showing up here, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| I'm actually happy with the language of my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| I have sat through countless policy review meetings where we have hacked policies up because we've, this word's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| This word's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| You know, we need to, the resolution's clear, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4387)|
| 1:13:14| I mean, again, this is the resolution that I will support as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4394)|
| 1:13:27| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| I just need to point this out and then I'm going to just reiterate what I said on Monday night because I think it still stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| But I think it's important to look at the facts of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| And the fact is that if Knox County Schools or any district put this into place, it would be teachers volunteering and being vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4420)|
| 1:13:52| I think it's disingenuous and it's just false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| It's a false narrative that any district would go to any teacher and ask them if they would want to carry a firearm in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| I just don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| So I think just continuing to say that is just spreading fear and it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| And I just wish we wouldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| I wish we would dwell on the facts of the spirit of the law and what's actually in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| And so that's just kind of as an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| I would also say I'm also not against this law and I'll reiterate what I said on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| I don't think that we as a board should be discussing security in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| I think that we need to trust our superintendent and our school security chief Perriard to make security decisions for matters pertaining to security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4474)|
| 1:14:44| That's why we employ them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| I think we need to trust them to make these decisions and that we should not be discussing security in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| And I so I will not be voting for the amended resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4492)|
| 1:15:00| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| And I appreciate what I've heard from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| I want to just make sure that that is clear that as I approach this, I looked at the law because it is a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| It's a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| So it doesn't matter whether I support it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| It's a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| So we're going to I think it's important that we understand that as Knox County School Board, we we obey the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4521)|
| 1:15:29| So now that I understand that it's a law, what do we do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| What I'm understanding was two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| One was to allow teachers to be armed and it gave the guidelines that it has in the law right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| And the other was that we do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| So that was the two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| And so basically what I was looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| And once again, the language of this resolution, I like because it doesn't even have to address the law in terms of whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4550)|
| 1:16:02| It's basically that we feel like we have whatever we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| It's in place and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| And so at this point, we do not have to arm teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| So we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| And what I'm hearing the community want is that we make a statement are we or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| So I'm saying I think we ought to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| That's why with this resolution for me, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| And it works well if we put only in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| So it's not to say this is not a good statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| It's that it's not for me a definitive statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| And so I call for previous question unless someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4603)|
| 1:16:53| On the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| All those in favor of calling the question say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| So now we will now vote on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| So we will be voting on the amended resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| Mr. Can you do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Miss bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Miss Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| That's for yes votes and for no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| So now we go back to the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Can we then have discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Or was the call the question for the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4661)|
| 1:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Mr. Watson has a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| So we're we're voting on the particular item in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| We obviously know that there's another item similar to it after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| Should this item pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| I'm assuming we would still have the discussion on the last item, although it's very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| Is there is there any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| I'm assuming there's no way to combine the discussion between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| I mean, it seems it seems odd that I don't think we're going to pass both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| I think that's pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| But this also seems odd that there's the potential we could pass both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| I've wondered the same thing when we had two of the similar items on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| So I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| So I would say this, Mr. Watson, that there's there's two items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| This board could pass neither pass one or pass both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| And there's no way to combine the both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Do a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| You could always make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| Miss Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| Again, I want to want to speak to the public discussions because that was a concern of mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| And just to be clear, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| Before this draft was attached, I did share it with Mr. Dupour, shared it with Chief Perriard, who is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| I also shared it with Sheriff Spangler and Chief Noel and had personal conversations with both of them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| And did not get any feedback as to not moving forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| If that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| I mean, I feel like changes from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| I feel like I know that if there were concerns, they would have and I would have respected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| I just want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| I feel like your resolution is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| And as I said, Monday night, I will vote on the original document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| So and I hope it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| We can have dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| We have dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| So you're saying, Miss Christie, that the way that it's written, that this means that we're not going to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4808)|
| 1:20:18| I mean, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| We are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| We all agree on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| I feel confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| We will not be arming students because they may be the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| When we talk about the victims being armed, they are victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| So we're saying when we say with this statement that we are not arming teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| That is the intent of this statement, that things that we are trusting our security professionals and experts to manage the safety and security of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4843)|
| 1:20:55| So the way that it is sounding like the question being asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| But I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| So the way as I read it, the way it stands, that I noticed Mr. Wright, you was naughty, that it says to you that we're not going to arm teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4863)|
| 1:21:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4878)|
| 1:21:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| So we are now voting on the original resolution from Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| Ms. Coatney, can you please take a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Dr. Butler, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Ms. Owen, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Mr. Watson, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| Ms. Byke, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| Do you want to change it to no or you're still passing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| I'm still passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| So that is seven yes votes and one pass vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| OK, so motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4947)|
| 1:22:38| Item 11F, discussion and possible action on resolution of the Board of Education of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| affirming that school security officers and school resource officers will continue to be the only armed personnel on Knox County Schools campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4965)|
| 1:22:56| Motion by Ms. Byke, a second by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Do we have any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| I know we've talked a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| We talked a lot about it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| So the only thing, well, I'm going to say that I really appreciate Ms. Owen's, Board Member Owen's, bringing the resolution that she brought on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4986)|
| 1:23:16| When I first turned what I had in that was originally on the agenda, it was before it was actually a law and certainly was a strong response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=4996)|
| 1:23:29| And I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| And so I really appreciate what Board Member Owen's brought to us on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| And so I appreciate that she was willing to meet with me today at our publicly called meeting where we were able to draft with some community members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5016)|
| 1:23:45| This and I feel like it is very succinct and very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| And I really appreciate, you know, what we have substituted in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5028)|
| 1:23:53| And so with that, I will just read this email that we all all appear to have gotten from an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| It says this was sent yesterday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| It says, Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Now that this ridiculous teacher carry bill has actually been signed into law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| I am again asking slash borderline demanding that you do not allow anyone besides school SROs and or KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| I assume she also meant to include Knox County Sheriff's Department to carry guns in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| I do not and will not feel safe going to work or allowing my children to attend school in this if this is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| As I have stated previously, if teachers are allowed to anonymously to most of us carry guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| the odds of an accidental shooting are much higher than the odds of these teachers somehow protecting students from an active shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5075)|
| 1:24:43| We go and this is the part that really kind of hit me where she says we go through training every single school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| That teaches us as teachers what to do in a case of an active shooter situation in a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| We have to witness over and over again these tragedies and learn from what these other teachers and students did right and what they did wrong and learn from their mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5095)|
| 1:25:04| We are taught that hiding, locking doors and staying quiet is the best thing that we can do as teachers to keep our kids safe and allow trained SRO and KPD officers to do what they are trained to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5104)|
| 1:25:16| This is how our schools should remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| That really hit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| That is why I understand that this is a law and maybe some other school systems are going to benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| For Knox County, I think we have a very good system in place and I appreciate all of the leadership and the people that do those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| I feel like this resolution represents that accurately and sends a very clear message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| Do we have any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| Thank you for putting this together and thank you all for going through the process of looking at it again and meeting with the public, those who came out with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5151)|
| 1:26:05| What I really like about this one is to be it resolved, it has to only end there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| Honestly, the board has just approved one and I think, well I don't think I know, I heard two of the board members who said they read it that this is what is going to do what we want to do and that is that we are not going to arm teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5173)|
| 1:26:33| We have already accomplished this and that is the reason why I think if you could withdraw it because I don't think we are going to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5193)|
| 1:26:47| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| I would like to hear from any other board members that might share that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5208)|
| 1:26:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| I don't necessarily share or not share that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| My purpose in bringing this was only to find some common ground between the two that were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| I don't think there is anything in here that says we oppose the law or oppose anything that brought the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5231)|
| 1:27:24| It is just meant to make it very clear and as static and unemotional as language can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5244)|
| 1:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Ms. Weick, I do appreciate the work that you have done on it and Ms. Owen for helping to kind of bring some consistency between the two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5260)|
| 1:27:49| I am not going to be voting on it not because I don't appreciate the work and not because I don't think it is clear but because I think it would be an exercise in futility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5269)|
| 1:27:58| I think we have already done one vote with adding one word only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| To me that vote would be more of a political statement and that is not the statement I am trying to make tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| I think we do need a message that is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| We voted on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| It wasn't my preference but I voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I understand that and I appreciate those opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5297)|
| 1:28:24| Then I hope I will move to remove this from the agenda only in hopes that the community can feel comforted that we are all on the same page by the other resolution that did pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5304)|
| 1:28:43| It doesn't sound like they are but I am going to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| I am going to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| Do we need a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5333)|
| 1:29:17| Item 11F has been withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| The motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5362)|
| 1:29:36| We will move on to our other public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5376)|
| 1:29:45| Michelle Meehan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5385)|

| 1:30:26| in expressing our deep concerns that KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| might spend over $400,000 on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| completely unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| On page B10 of the budget for special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| under other expenses, there is a note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| that requests $420,000 for additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| from the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| This is apparently for a massive audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| of the special education system, not what one might understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| as it is line item description in service staff development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Two months ago, parents came to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| to ask where was the RFP tied to Jason Meyers' January 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| presentation that included specific references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| to the least restrictive environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| and modified content based on task force recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| number two, essentially to bring in an inclusion expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| and support teachers in best inclusive practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Then what appeared a month later was an RFP completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| unconnected to what we as a public and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| imagine you as a school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| were led to believe as fulfilling Jason Meyers'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| months long detailed assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| KCS and every Tennessee school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| already gets a deep dive special education audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| each year from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| The results are posted on the TDO website and are quite clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| So we get this information every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| and it's no coincidence that the areas we consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| fall short are on this issues over which we face lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| like LRE and child fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| I can tell you that as one of the probably 10 families who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| have a student on alternate assessment being educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| for over 80% of their day in the general education environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| the continually missed target for LRE in K through 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| doesn't come anywhere close to representing the true scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| of our district's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| I say this because in the past nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| what I have witnessed is unnecessary segregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| being challenged in IEP meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| and flipped from as much as 5.5 hours per day in a CDC room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| to full time gen ed with appropriate supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| Success all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| Even with time to provide modified content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| being the biggest support need for teachers in each case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| So this is where the task force focuses recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| on the need for best inclusive practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Did you know that Justin Gilbert, the attorney who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| won the MQ landmark case against Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| was asked to speak to the task force last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| He volunteered his time over Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| and basically told the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| how to put him out of a job here in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| This is probably why the task force was so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| clear in its recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| We know our district's deficits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| And just like in IEPs, after our kids deficits are identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| we need to get to work making meaningful progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on an audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| does not align with the resolution passed in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| To take away what parents have been told to expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| and substitute it with something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| is not only a financial mistake, but a huge betrayal of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| I do have a couple of copies written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| by professionals who partner with school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| in implementing best inclusive practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| And I wanted to give those to a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Betsy's my representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5609)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Let's see, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| I'm so sorry, Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| I cannot read your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5631)|
| 1:34:08| My name is Christy Taft, and I live in the county, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| And I'm a teacher that has been teaching since I was 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| And I'm still teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Not in the public school, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| And we moved here in 2012, and one of the first places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| we visited was Cates Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| We really hoped to see a black bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| We saw a crowd stopped on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| and they pointed to a place where one had just been sighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| I ran to the spot, and there was a bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| but it was a baby bear rambling around in the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| not far from where I was standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| I was hoping to get a good picture of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| but I stopped and thought, where's the mother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| And then I looked, and I saw her coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| And so I took off running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| And I knew I didn't want to come between a baby bear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| and its mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Not only bears will risk their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| to protect their young, but also most animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| especially birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| It's in their instinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Now, this is true for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| Most of the time, children don't know what is safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| and what is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| In their innocence, they trust that their parents will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| protect them from all harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| It's the responsibility of the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| to protect their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| The parents will sometimes let another authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| like family, a school, or church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| share in this responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| If they don't do a good job of protecting the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| the parents should remove their child from the care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| Letting the children see pornography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| and hear about things they can't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| understand, like transgenderism, bisexual, non-sexual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| and on and on, is a burden and too heavy for a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| These things will only trouble their little hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| and make them worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| As children, they cannot really understand it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| We need to protect them from such things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| Here's a quote from Corrie ten Boom, who in World War II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| helped rescue Jews from going to the concentration camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| And she wrote a book called The Hiding Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| She remembers a lesson her father taught her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| when she was small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| She asked a question, and the answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| was beyond her understanding as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Her father then asked her if she could carry a heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| if she would carry the heavy suitcase as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| were getting on the train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Corrie replied that the suitcase was too heavy for her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| but not too heavy for her father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| In response, her father said that God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| knew when burdens were too heavy for her to bear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| and that God had provided her parents to carry them for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Later, God would carry many burdens in that concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| camp and help her carry them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Whatever it takes to protect our children from harm, it's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| and it's our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Next, Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5852)|

| 1:37:50| Corrie Ten Boom was a Dutch watchmaker and later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| a Christian writer and public speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5872)|

| 1:38:05| In her book, The Hiding Place, Corrie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| described a conversation with her father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| as they were coming home on a train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| and she heard a phrase in a poem at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| that she did not understand and was troubling her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| So seated next to father in the train compartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| I suddenly asked, father, what is sex sin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| He turned to look at me as he always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| did when answering a question, but to my surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| he said nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| At last, he stood up, lifting his traveling case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| from the rack over our heads and set it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Will you carry it off the train, Corrie, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| I stood up and tugged at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| It was crammed with the watches and spare parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| he had purchased that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| It's too heavy, I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Yes, he said, and it would be a pretty poor father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| who would ask his little daughter to carry such a load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| It's the same way, Corrie, with knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Some knowledge is too heavy for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| When you are older and stronger, you can bear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| For now, you must trust me to carry it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| And I was satisfied, more than satisfied, wonderfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| at peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| There were answers to this and all my hard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| For now, I was content to leave them in my father's keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| This memory from early in her life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| is one that she kept with her in the face of witnessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| and experiencing horrors beyond imagination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| during her time in concentration camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| After seeing something torturous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| she had these thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| It was father's train case once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Such cruelty was too much to grasp, too much to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Heavenly Father, carry it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| We're all experiencing suffering, pain, and trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Often, the weight of the world can feel too heavy a burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| As life unfolds around us and brings loss and suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| we can become lost in a sea of why questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| We feel alone, abandoned, confused, and lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| In these moments of despair, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| to trust what is true of our Heavenly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| Father over our feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| He never leaves us or forsakes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| He has unending love for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| He is sovereign over all our suffering and joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| He will always carry what is too heavy for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| How much knowledge are we asking our children to carry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| We're asking our children to carry a burden of knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| that is too heavy for them to carry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| while it is ultimately a parental responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| to make sure their children are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| carrying too heavy a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Now, those county schools must make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| it's not adding to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Fortunately, some of our state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| realize this and have, during the session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| passed an amendment to HB 863, which most of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| It was given tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| For the purposes of this section, a material that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| in whole or part, contains nudity, descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6023)|

| 1:40:28| excess violence, or set of masochistic abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| is not appropriate for the age or maturity level of a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| It is not permitted in any of the grades, kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| through 12, and must not be maintained in a school library's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| collection, or is patently offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| These amendments have been confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| by Casey Washburn, the legislative attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| for the Tennessee General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| and will be forwarded to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| as you guys have already received tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Thanks, Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Lauren?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Hey, Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| Just that you're a nine-county resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Good afternoon to my Knox County school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| My name is Lauren Breslin, and I am a West Coast political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| refugee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| My family moved to Knoxville last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| and we have been spending these past few months scouting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| out Protestant churches and political action organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| Today, I would like to use my three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| to introduce myself and share why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| I will be closely following this school board's policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Personally, I am a wife to a Navy veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| so the encouragement of patriotism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| in our government schools is very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| We have four children, ages 17 down to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| I have homeschooled them with a classical education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| for the past 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Parental rights, religious freedom, medical freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| and the freedom to educate without state involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| are top priorities for our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| I am not a fan of school choice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| comes with more government funding or oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Professionally, I've been in higher education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| I have taught private courses for private and state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| universities and community colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| My experiences in those settings led me to the realization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| that the government school system has been failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| children for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| I found that most students who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| ill-prepared for the academic rigors of higher education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| Hence, I have home-educated all of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| and I am not actively encouraging any of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| to enter a state college system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| Politically, I have joined Knox for Liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| which promotes the values of faith, family, and freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Through my participation, I actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| follow local voting records and policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| I also work for Moms for America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| which is a national movement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| reclaiming our culture for truth, family freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| and the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| I am the executive assistant for the National School Board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Leadership Council, which helps school boards achieve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| their goals by focusing on elevating academics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| and leaving developing world views to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| Finally, I am a new member of Moms for Liberty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| and I plan on attending and speaking at school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| meetings when my schedule allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| My last point is that I am a member of the National School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| My last point to share is that one of my former home states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| is Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| We lived there for almost a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| The Oregon Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6210)|

| 1:43:37| and comprehensive sex ed, including supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| gender-expansive curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Last year, they dropped all graduation requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| and no longer require basic reading, writing, or math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| What began as an attempt to be more inclusive and equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| has now resulted in adding even more hardship for students who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| will be completely unprepared for their next chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| as adults and US citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| I hope you see the connection and will make every effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| to stay focused on academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Leave the sex discussions, the political activism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| and the medical decisions to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| who are the true experts of their own children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Thanks for your time and attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6256)|

| 1:44:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Oh, he, I'm sorry, he split his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6280)|
| 1:44:40| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Well, what am I doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Sherry Super, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| I've been on Facebook this week, the social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| mental institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| And some of the things that they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| about this board and my group and people like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| when they don't think you're looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| let me just share a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| We've been called evangelical Trumpers, crypto Nazis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| terrorists, cultists, murderers, and sociopaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| all in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| One post said, I was challenged to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| genderqueer by the local leaders in the crypto Nazi movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| I've gotten insight into what's wrong with these Moms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| for Liberty people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| Who'd have thought we'd have to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| to Nazis in 2024 in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| It would take a pretty sick, twisted individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| to read this book, what the Nazi woman claims was in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| I don't know what that even means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| These people are trying to ban our books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| and turn our schools into shooting galleries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| Well, Facebook suspended me for 22 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| for posting something from genderqueer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| on Facebook, the same book that he thinks is perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| See, guys, all of this, this is what's in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| Then he goes on to have a little something to say about Betsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| Betsy Henderson has supported more ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| for the school board to assassinate children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| than any other school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| She blatantly stated on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| that she is in favor of infecting children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| with deadly diseases and now just shooting them outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| The woman is a terrorist who belongs in jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| and now she wants teachers to shoot up our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| It's like a scene from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| Guys, these people don't like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| They're not afraid to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| To my Republican friends, to my conservative friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| stand up for yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| Have courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Tell them no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| You know, we've talked about this for seven months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| with these books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| And what we got was a lousy, you know, we've been coming here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| we got a lousy review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| But when these people come in and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| start screaming and yelling, you know, we're intimidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| You're all concerned about the school teachers with guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| but you're not concerned about the fact that there's 87 books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| 21 volumes from assassination classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| where kids are being shown how to shoot up a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| But you won't get the books out because we need a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| Thank goodness that the Tennessee legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| has put something into place that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| get some of this garbage out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| But you didn't need a law, you needed some courage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| And we're going to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| And I appreciate everything that you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Sean Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| Let's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Hi, Sean Murphy, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Can I just, before we start, can I just ask a two point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| OK, first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| My understanding of the law is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| allowed to talk on an item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| as well as talk under public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| I assume I have that correct because you're letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| Well, I think, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| I stepped out for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| But I believe you did take up the three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| on the other item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| So I think we'd have to vote to allow you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| to have another three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| Is that OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| My understanding is that, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| is where I'm asking for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| that the law is individuals are allowed to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| on any item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| And that's separate from public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| So I'll stop talking because you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| you had to follow the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| I totally see what you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6537)|
| 1:48:57| It's not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| It's board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| And board policy states that you can sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| to speak for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Tonight, because it's a voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| you can sign up for any topic whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| But you can sign up for three minutes, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| Like all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| Is that the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| It's a board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| I ask if that's the law, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| My understanding of the law is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| than what you're stating policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| I'm not going to answer any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Since you're not recognizing me, I'll stop talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| If you want to allow me to talk, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6569)|
| 1:49:36| Well, we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| We'll have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| So I make a motion to let Mr. Murphy speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| for three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| And I think Ellen, I believe Ellen went before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| But I just wanted to check that I did not miss you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| You did go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6601)|
| 1:50:01| Well, we have no more public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| So with that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240509?start=6603)|
