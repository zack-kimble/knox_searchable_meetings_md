| 0:00:00| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=0)|
| 0:00:15| Yes, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=15)|
| 0:00:16| I guess we're going now to the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=16)|
| 0:00:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| I guess before we get started, if I could try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=22)|
| 0:00:25| we don't have to debate this for three or four hours tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=25)|
| 0:00:30| What I talked about during the committees is to have a workshop, public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=30)|
| 0:00:42| and give the citizens a chance to come to this building and hear what Knoxville 1 questions have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=42)|
| 0:00:51| and they talk about how they come up with these ideas and what cities they use to get the best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=51)|
| 0:01:00| instead of asking us to vote on something tonight when we have no idea what cities they used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| who were the people who participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| They may have that information tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| I think Lawrence, Mr. Tullock was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| And someone may have that information tonight to go ahead and give us to get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| But, you know, I've had some calls over the weekend, you know, some people in favor, some people against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| some people don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| And I think before we get too far down the road to changing basically our constitution of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| that we need to have some public forums and educate this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| and also educate the citizens before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| So if we could do that tonight and we could save ourselves two or three hours maybe of having to talk about nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=105)|
| 0:01:52| different items, we could talk about them at a workshop where we can dedicate our whole time to these nine questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| and possibly more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| So I'd make a motion that we defer these 30 days and we have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=122)|
| 0:02:13| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Mr. Moore, you're talking about having to talk before the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| Yes, have a workshop before the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| And then we can vote on it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| And then I think we could have a special call meeting if we need to if they wanted it passed before the end of March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| or the first of April, before the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| I think April 18th was the date they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| March 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Well, let me ask the law director if we would pass this the next meeting in March and April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=164)|
| 0:02:53| will we still have time to get on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| We need to have any item that this commission wishes to place on the ballot heard on second reading by the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=177)|
| 0:03:09| So April and May would be the last two opportunities to have a first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| If we delay this, I mean, we can have our two readings and still make it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| But if it fails on those two readings, I know there's interest in the community of having a petition to get it on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| ballot through the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| But there's also deadlines for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| And what I'd really like to ask the law director is what is the deadline if they go through the petition process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| The petition process has already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| It began back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| It should be completed by mid-March, at least through the election commission process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| Then, once that is certified, the petitioners have 75 days in which to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| and get over 40-some-odd-thousand signatures on the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| Right now, they've filed two petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| There will be two questions on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| It consolidates the nine questions into five and four, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| And so they're going to go ahead and go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| I have no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| And they are time constrained in order to, you know, get their mission accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| They have 75 days roughly beginning mid-March in order to get those petitions back to the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| to get those matters placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| So regardless of what this body does, if this body delays by one month, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| I guess the petitioners will carry on, I'm sure, with their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| State your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| My name is Don Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| My address is 1214 Craig Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| And, Mr. Chairman, commissioners, we appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| I'm here as a member of the Knox Charter Petition Steering Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| And I request as much as you have heard discussed by Mr. Owings, there is a time constraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| We are here tonight to address perhaps many, if not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| the questions that you might have both in terms of substance as well as procedure with regard to the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| Mr. Owings has described it accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| The dates that have been mentioned are real dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| We are time constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| And with due respect, we too have been here for the last four hours waiting for the opportunity to have discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| and that discussion primarily to respond to any questions that you may have on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=364)|
| 0:06:12| A number of people are here to address the Knox County One Question process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| the charter petition initiative itself, the substance of the individual proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| So as you may have had the opportunity since your committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| and with the additional information that you have seen in the media during the past several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| then we would like to have that opportunity to share with you information that will be instructive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| perhaps in your reaching a decision, if you're able to do that tonight, to pass on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| and then perhaps proceed to a workshop where additional information can be provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| where other people in the community can attend and take advantage of that hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| and then help inform you as to what you might prefer to do on a subsequent second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| all within that time frame that you've heard Mr. Owings describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| You can turn your light out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| The question arose as to which were the comparison cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| They can be listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| They can be found in the Knox County One Question report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| The selection criteria for those cities are there, as are much of the nearly all the work of the Knox County One Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| That website has been up, has been up for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Its email, its URL is discoveret.org slash KCOQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| Those things are all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| I mean, I can quickly find the eight communities if you don't have them handy, but I'm looking them up right now online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| That data, those data are already available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| We needn't hold up things on that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| In fact, those same documents can be accessed, and that's the Baker Center report that the minister is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| Those same documents may be found on the Knox Charter Petition website as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Before I do, let me say that this group held meetings at halls, South Doyle, at Bearden, Carter, and Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=501)|
| 0:08:35| Five hundred citizens came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| The Baker Center was enlisted to look at best practices across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| They compared them to 160 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| All of this is available on the website, and you've had this out for several weeks, if not months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| And so I would like to make a substitute motion, and my substitute motion is that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| and approve ordinances 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, and 109 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=534)|
| 0:09:03| Included in that motion is that we have a workshop forum, if you will, the morning of March the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| This room is available beginning at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| So that it's on a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| And I just mentioned that day because I know this room is available then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| That we have a commission workshop at that time to answer any questions anyone might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Could you repeat the date, please, again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| March 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| It's a Wednesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| We meet at 8 a.m. here, and we can take several hours, if need be, to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| to ask any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Also included in my proposal, and I pass this out, is should this commission vote to have these on two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=576)|
| 0:09:45| that there would be nine forums to be held across Knox County between now and the beginning of early voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| which would be in July, that there would be one in each commission district hosted by members of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| and that it would be held at a time and place to be determined by the individual commissioners in the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| That would be nine public forums that would be held before early voting takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| to give people an adequate opportunity to come and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| I will say that some of these I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Some of them I don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| I am not going to be in favor, for example, of having the county mayor appoint the trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| and the property assessor and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| I'm just against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| But just because I'm against that doesn't mean that I don't want the citizens to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| I think that I'm one citizen, and there are 400,000 people out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| and I'd like to see all of the citizens to weigh in on these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| I think that you've spent your time, your effort to put this before the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| and I think they deserve an opportunity to vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| This takes two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| It takes a two-thirds vote on both readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| And as I understand it, Mr. Law Director, we do not have to do them consecutively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| If we do it in February and we decide not to do it in March, it could come back in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| although I would hope that if we do have this public meeting on March the 12th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| and questions are being asked that perhaps individuals would be ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| I talked with Mr. Greg McKay with the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| He tells me that when the citizen petition was put forward, I believe it was on the wheel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| or maybe it was the hotel, it was $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| And so I believe these folks will get their petitions signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| I believe they'll get the signatures needed on the two initiatives that will be put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| You're looking at about $40,000 for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| This way, the voters will vote on eight, possibly nine, charter amendments rather than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| I see that as a great benefit to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| So I'm going to have the substitute motion that we take those with a public meeting to be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| and should this pass on second reading that there would be nine forums, a minimum of nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| there could be more, which would be hosted by this commission all across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| It's been properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Don, we had this discussion about a week or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=726)|
| 0:12:16| We're going through the process of trying to figure out if these are good things to put on the ballot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=736)|
| 0:12:25| I see some problems with them legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| There's a few of these that I think there's some conflicts with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Then there's questions that I have whether or not they're good or not for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=753)|
| 0:12:42| And what I see from your group, and I appreciate all the work that your group has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| but as we go through these other public hearings, what I've heard from your group is the inflexibility for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=768)|
| 0:12:58| modifications to any of these nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| Is that still true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Well, what is true is that these nine proposals have come directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=782)|
| 0:13:12| very directly from the process that started with Knox County One Question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| or that started actually with Nine Counties One Vision that became later an effort in Knox County One Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| And the 500 citizens that were referred to, I believe Commissioner Hammond mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| the people who attended in all parts of the county expressed virtually in that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| It was put in language that was appropriate for the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| But those are expressions of people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| They didn't come from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| They didn't come specifically from members of the steering committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| They came as a result of that public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| So it would be inappropriate, and we told the people who came to those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| we will not transform what you have said into something that we want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| So this is a direct expression of what they have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| And to that extent, we believe we should honor that and go forward with what they expressed in those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| So that may be termed inflexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| At the end of the day, the opportunity is there for a yes or no vote on the part of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| We think that's the purest form of democracy, that people have the opportunity to have an up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| or down vote for the first time in 200 years on what form of government going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| given what the Supreme Court said a year ago, a little over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| We now have the opportunity for the first time in that period of time to structure Knox County government going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| So pardon the long-winded answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| But that is why the provisions are there and need to remain as they're stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| That's not the first time in 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| It's the first time since the Supreme Court made the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Because people spoke in 88 when we adopted the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| Then they spoke again in 94 with whether or not to have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| So it's not the first time in 200 years that people in Knox County get a chance to vote on the form of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| that they wish to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| There are the nine provisions actually address both in terms of legislative as well as executive branch changes that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=924)|
| 0:15:33| I believe it's fair to say, have not been changed in the longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| But we can debate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Well, I just, you know, and I've heard members of your body say they wanted input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| and they wanted to debate these in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| But when you come before us, that's not sincere because you're inflexible to make any modifications in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=951)|
| 0:16:00| I mean, there's a few of them that maybe I could support with a very small modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| But from what I'm hearing from you is that even a small modification would be unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Well, Commissioner, I think, and as I shared with you when we spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| I think that puts the citizens of Knox County who have participated in the process in the position of negotiating with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| themselves and that's not a logical position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| But even if that's not, but even if it's what we hear as we go through these public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| and that's what we're hearing from the public and they say, yeah, I think that's a smart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| or a good idea to modify this provision a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| And that's not what I'm getting from your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| You know, there's some things here I think that maybe once they went through a vetting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| that maybe they would agree with some of the concerns that these commissioners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| and that other citizens would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| And I would just, you know, I would hope that you all would be willing to work with this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| to try to come up with some good ideas so that we do have a form of government that the county wishes to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| But I'm assuming that you're not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Well, I think the petitions are prepared and the language is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| And I think you have had the opportunity to read it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| and to know the history of how those ordinances have come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| And, Don, I have read them and that's why I have concerns with some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Some of them, I'm in favor of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| I think they're good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Others, like Commissioner Hammond pointed out, there's some that he's against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| And, you know, but I guess I'm going to let others speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| But Commissioner Hammond, your motion, could you tell me again which items you want to go ahead and vote on right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1068)|
| 0:18:01| There were eight items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| The one item had to do with county employees serving on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| I believe that's number 107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| That would not be included in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| It's 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| I think it's 108, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Whichever one it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| Oh, yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| So, yes, it would be 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| And the law director has just confirmed that we don't have to have consecutive votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| In other words, if we voted this month, we don't have to vote in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| We could come back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| But part of my motion is that we have that hearing the morning of March the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| And also, should we pass it on second reading, that there would be a minimum of nine forums to be held before the start of early voting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| Mr. Chairman, as a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| may I ask Tom McAdams to share with you information concerning the specific voting on the individual nine ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1133)|
| 0:19:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I'm Tom McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Just as a point, and I'd ask John to confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I believe Section 2.08 of the charter requires you to vote separately on these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| I don't believe you can vote on seven of them at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| And I would suggest, just for the avoidance of any doubt or subsequent challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| that if the motion could be broken down into seven separate motions and you voted on each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| I believe that would clearly satisfy the requirements of Section 2.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| And I don't have a problem doing that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| John, you're looking that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| Mr. Chairman, I did have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| You've got one of these here, if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| It's basically it's an ordinance that says if any of these ordinances have a conflict with any existing part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:23| It's 109?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| I guess my question is, one of the ordinances, when you're setting this up with the 11, say, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:35| you've got a proposal to have a, to be staggered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| You're going with a six-year term for basically half of them and then a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:46| When we have a term limit provision that says members can only serve two consecutive four-year terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| so does that do away with the term limit provision or does it, I mean, how does this resolve that conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| These are questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| And if I may, let me ask Mr. McAdams again, because I think there are two questions there, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| One is the substantive one about the term limits provision as it presently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| And the other is the procedure that is contemplated, as you have just indicated, in the one provision that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| anything that's in conflict with what gets passed must get revised in order to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| So if I may ask Tom to address that in both of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| Commissioner Laubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| I just want to say I agree with the gentleman we need to vote on these one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| And I'm going to go ahead and tell you there's some of these that I think are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Some of them I think can be tweaked and can be fixed through amendments, through the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| Now, if this body, you may find at the end of this process that you may find that we've improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:04| and made these amendments more to your like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| You may like our version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| If you don't, you'll still have the option to go out and gather the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Now, I'm hoping that we can avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| I've worked in a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| It's lots of hard, hard work, and I hope that I can save your organization from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| But some of these simply, some of us on this body are going to attempt to fix them through amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| And I hope you'll be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| If the final version that passes is not to your liking, you still have the option to put your version on a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:51| But the legislative process and the process of amendments is as old as civilization itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| It is a long tradition that whatever bill is sent to Congress, that it is altered, it evolves, and it grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:06| and then it finally becomes the law that is eventually passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| These ordinances, these amendments, I believe have some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| And I believe in the spirit that these charter amendments were offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| But I believe that we, the legislative body, need to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| We need to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| We need to offer amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| We need to debate each one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| And then, if you're happy with the outcome of that, then it goes on the ballot as we've altered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| If you're not happy with that, you can still put your version on the ballot, too, through your petition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:54| But, frankly, sir, we are an elected legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| We have a mandate from the people to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| We have a mandate to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Now, there's a lot of groups, a lot of groups that I'm members of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| I could get the Tennessee Conservative Union together, and we could come up with all kinds of funny ways to change county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| government that I don't think would be to your liking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| But it's up to this legislative body, if you want us to put these on the ballot, it's up to us to do our job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| to legislate, to offer amendments, to debate amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| And I hope that you'll sit back and watch the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| And I hope that you're very pleased with the amendments and that you find that we have improved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| If not, you still have the option of going through the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| But I'm going to do everything I can to try to see that something that is both palatable to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and palatable to us winds up on the ballot because I know what kind of work it is to go out and get petitions signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| If I may, Mr. McAdams is here to address Mr. Lutho's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| And then, Brad, you may want to come up to talk about any amendment process associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Do you have a question for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| I'd ask the question about the how the six and the four, how did that relate back to the term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:20| which states specifically two four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| So I don't know how it gets cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| I'm happy to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I don't have the term limit provision in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| One of the amendments is what I would call a standard provision that appears in most charters of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:42| And that is the one of how you deal with inconsistent or sections that are in conflict with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| This particular charter does not have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| And one of these amendments is intended to add that to address the issue of how do you deal with conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Generally, if there is a conflict and you go to the conflict section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| it talks about which section is going to prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And I believe in this case you would have a charter provision dealing with term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| You have a charter provision dealing with sort of special one-time term limits that are set this one six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| And that's the one that I believe would prevail under the terms of that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| So what would be the outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I mean, so would it do away with term limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| No, it does not change the concept of term limits at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| The term limits amendment would continue to be part of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| and continue to be enforceable in accordance with its terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| There would be this one special election, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| that produced the alternated elections instead of having them all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| But the term limit amendment would remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Well, I guess I could speak here sort of personally about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| It's because I'm going to be term limited out at the end of this term in ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| And your provision you've come up with, District 5, which I happen to represent, would be a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| Now, I would, under normal circumstances, have the right to run for office, if I so wished, in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:29| But if District 5 is a six-year term, then I would have to wait until 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:39| And so that takes away a little bit of my right as a citizen, if I so wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Now, that may be a little bit selfish on my part, but I'm still saying there are conflicts out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| And that's a potential conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Maybe I'm just one, but, you know, I thought we were supposed to make sure that we even take care of the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| That's why, you know, these are just a little thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| You know, there are so many things that I've read these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| There are lots of questions out there, lots of conflicts, lots of conflicts with state law that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| if we want to sit down, if we want to stay here until tomorrow morning and discuss these things, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| But, you know, at the end of the day, I see the inflexibility of your group to change any part of your proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:34| And that's why I don't feel like you've brought this here in a sincere, open, transparent way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| so that we could debate these to try to figure out what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| Well, Commissioner, at the heart of this process has been transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| We've had a request, which we are honoring, for example, to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| I believe Commissioner Moore made the request, but we have copies for each of you of the information that he requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| One is a list of the steering committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| We have that available to you tonight, as well as a timeline for the entire process that has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| Just last week, we initiated a fundraising effort to underwrite the cost of the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| We will, at the time when that's been underway for more than a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| we will make the information available as to who has made contributions to that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| So everything we do, in fact, is transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Everything we have done to this point is transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Well, Don, the problem is, and it's not, I don't guess you want to call it a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| but the fact of the matter is this body cannot discuss these items until we are here gathered tonight in an open public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:59| So this is our first opportunity to discuss this amongst ourselves and with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| because we have a sunshine law that we are adhering to, and we continue to adhere to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| So we can't discuss these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| This is our first opportunity to discuss these, whether they're good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And that's what I'm talking about in a transparent and open way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| This is our first opportunity, and you've given us a mandate, either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| And I just don't see that as being sincere in bringing that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Yeah, Commissioner, I've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| And you can disagree with me, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| I'm still your friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| I hope you'll always be mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| But, you know, I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Well, I was only going to make the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| And I had had the impression that the committees had dealt with the matter last week in order to put it on the agenda for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| And perhaps that was an opportunity to discuss it, perhaps not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| And as Commissioner Harmon has pointed out earlier, even though you cannot convene outside this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| the opportunity has been there and will continue to be there to avail yourselves of the information that's available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| through the couple of websites that have been mentioned, among other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| I have a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Are these resolutions, are these ordinances, are they going to be placed individually on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| Is that the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| No, and I'll ask Tom McAdams to address that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| But there will be a block that is a legislative block, and then there's the block that's the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| But Tom can address that in greater detail from a legal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Now, this body has the option to put them on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| If we, the Knox County Commission, do it, we have the option to put them on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| That's correct, and that's one of the big advantages that County Commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| In a petition, everything that is in a single petition has to be voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| One vote on everything that's in the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| And you can put one item in a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| If you wanted to have nine different items voted on separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| you would have to circulate nine different petitions and have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I understand that that would be more work for the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| but then I was leery of grouping them all together on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And I really like the idea for the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| And I've always thought that putting things on the ballot is good for democracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| and a good democratic way about going about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| But at the same time, the last time that something was put on the ballot, it was written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| there was 300 words in one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| And that was for the pension plan for the sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| And it's nothing against law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| But to me, that was very confusing and for the people and for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| So I would want to review, if these things are put on the ballot, I would want to review the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| Clinton, back in his administration, had sent out a memorandum to everybody in government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| for everything to be written in clear, plain language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| And I would want that to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| The other thing that I like is the public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I think we need to have an informed electorate who comes before the general election to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:24| At the same time, I believe with Commissioner Lambert that some of these might need to be tweaked a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| So thank you for the clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Don, I think I said at committees that I'd like to have a list of steering committees, fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| but also the people who attended all your forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| You know, I'd like to see the one in Hollis and see the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| were they from the 7th District or were they from North Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| or were they the same people at West Knoxville and South Knoxville and everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| And so I'd like to have that list, if you have that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| If I may, let me ask Edith Nell McNabb to share with you some observations on that process in terms of the numbers of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2040)|
| 0:34:08| and the possibility of identifying all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Well, before she comes, do you all have that list tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| I don't think we have that list with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Can you get it to the commission office tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| I think to the extent that that information exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| we'll make every effort to get you the information that would respond to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| And going on what Commissioner Luthold said, I mean, there's many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| And if we want to debate them all tonight, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| I can sit here as long as we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| But, you know, just like one of the issues, if the executive branch, the mayor, would appoint all these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| have you all brought up the salaries of what these folks would make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| And who's going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| And when is it going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Are we going to tell the people of Knox County before they vote or after they vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| Well, I think the first answer to your first question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| We haven't attempted to address salaries on positions that may or may not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| But the process would be one of an executive branch process and a legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| So in terms of the detail, and Commissioner DeVries addressed this a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| the simpler we have attempted at least to craft these in such a way that the message is very clear in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| what the vote will be rather than try to put a 300-word sentence dealing with nine different issues on a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| So those become administrative executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| and legislative branch processes, I think, once the results of the vote are known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Well, that may be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| You know, I'd like to know up front what it's going to cost financially this county going this way if it was to pass by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:58| Because if you look at what our countywide elected officials in Knox County make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| somewhere between $85,000 and $90,000 probably for the registered aides and the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| And if you look at our counterparts at the city, considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| And we have a much more bigger budget than our counterparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| So I think we owe it to the citizens if we're, you know, are we going to keep the salaries the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| or are they going to come in here and somebody says, well, I think they need to be $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| I think the school board just said the superintendent of Knox County should make $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I mean, what if they said that the mayor is going to appoint and it won't be Mayor Rice until he's begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| But what if it's someone else and it will be someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| and they come in here and say the salary for the registered aides ought to be $250,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Let me, Kathy is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| And Kathy Hamilton, more than anyone I know, can address the issue of budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| and individual departments and the salary issues that will be among the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| You're exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| It will be before the county government after the vote on these petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| Kathy Hamilton, 1528 Botsford Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| Commissioner Moore, one of the reasons that this particular provision was suggested is that we felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| the group felt that this would give more control to the salaries to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Right now, for all the fee offices, county commission does not have a vote on any of the salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| or on the number of positions that are in each of the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| If the appointment of these positions was made a part of the mayor's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| and then the suggestion is that the mayor would suggest an appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| it would be confirmed by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| That would then bring all those positions and the salaries for all those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| into the county budget as a part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| So that's one of the reasons that this particular item was brought forward by some of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| and was suggested because it was seen as a means of giving more control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| and more accountability for positions and for salaries not only to the mayor but back to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| What do you tell the citizens of Knox County when you're taking away their rights to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| for the registered deeds, trustee, the county clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Well, what we're telling the citizens is that you have this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Here's a proposal that you can vote either up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Here are the reasons that that proposal was brought forward to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| And if they like the idea of more accountability for salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| for positions resting in the mayor's office and with this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| then I would suspect that they would vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| If they feel like that that additional accountability is not worth what they feel like they would lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| by not voting to elect those positions, then I suspect they would vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| Do you think you-does the group-have they discussed conflicts with the administration appointing, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| the property assessor or the director of properties or whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| having that power instead of the independence of the property assessor going out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| to praising every individual partial of your property and my property and all the citizens of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| If you work for the mayor and he says, we need to raise an additional whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| I need you to bump these properties up during reappraisal, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| is that a conflict if someone told you to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Well, what I will say is that I think the group that came forward with these proposals had probably as much discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| and as much spirited discussion as this group is going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| And they did look at a number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| and I think what they came down on is they felt like that with the appointment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| and with the approval by the legislative body that they had built in a series of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| And, again, I suspect that this is something that's going to be debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| and that the citizens out there are going to look at whether or not they think they are gaining more than they are losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| or vice versa, and that's going to determine how they're going to vote on the individual issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| And that's why I started out this conversation an hour, probably an hour ago, that we need to have debates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| And we don't need to pass anything tonight on first readings because if we change anything in the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| that's substantial, then we have to go back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| And I think that we ought to have some workshops and we ought to have public forums beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| And we said this during the appointment process, what's the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| The citizens told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| What's the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| We've got time between now and Commissioner Hammond said we didn't have to vote on them consecutive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| We could vote on this one tonight and get the next one in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| What's the hurry to do it tonight at 925 and to get it passed one time tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| Well, and, Commissioner, that was something that was discussed by Mr. Talekas as far as the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| And the Knox County One Question Group came out with a report in September and brought it to the commissioners in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| and delivered the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| And I think what they did is they waited to see if there was going to be anyone on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| who would bring these issues forward and who would propose amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| And when that action didn't take place, then the Charter Petition Group formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| and they started taking a look at the timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| And it's the timelines that that particular group has with going ahead with the petition effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| and placing it on the ballot as to whether or not that goes forward that is really driving the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| Because with the number of days that we have, if there are amendments that this body chooses not to put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2516)|
| 0:42:05| then if the time frame doesn't run as has been discussed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| then the Charter Petition Group will not have the right to go back before the election commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| and amend those charters that we're going out to gain signatures on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| those charter amendments that we're going out to gain signatures on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| So, again, I think if this group had its way, if we could make those time frames be anything different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| we would be more than happy to ask that it be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| Because then we would have the option of going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| and changing the charter provisions that we're going out to take to the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| and to get the petition signatures on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| But once we've lost that, then we either go forward with the amendments as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| or we don't go forward at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| And that's really what's driving the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I can't support it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| But if we have workshop and I asked a week ago to get these names of the people who participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:10| and we see tonight we don't have them, but we're going to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| You have them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| You don't have the people who went to each place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| You're going to get, you said a list of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| We have the members of the steering committee, which was one of your requests, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| I'm sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Well, that's quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| But what I asked for is the people who showed up to these meetings was because you said 600 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| I want to know if they're the 600 same people or the 300 same people went all over the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| or was it 600 different individuals because we've got a county of 400,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| And, you know, 600 people is quite a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| But it's a small minority to all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| And I think we owe it to them to have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| But I don't think we should have it on, you know, March the 12th at 8 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| We need to have it at night when people get off from work and can either get up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| or we have it out in different areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| So we get the public input and have your group come and we can debate these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| or explain them or whatever you want to and we can come back and vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| But I think you all should go ahead with the petition job in case we fail to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| or we can't get something passed, that you all still have a way to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| Commissioner Davis, and I'd like to say that we have seven lights that are still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| I have two questions or two issues, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| On 08-102, that ordinance has really two provisions in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| and I'd like to call for a division of that to be separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| because the first part talks about changing the number of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| and then it says and to align the Board of Education districts to the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| And I think those are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| Well, you already have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Don, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| As much as I'm in support of a lot of these issues and moving it forward to the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| I do have, you know, the public forum is what I raised during the committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| And so I'm a little bit supportive of Mr. Hammond's, but I'm also a little bit supportive of Mr. Moore's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| And when you look at educating the public, you know, we don't have many people here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| We're just debating this among ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| And if you had 500 people show up and you're approximately 50 on the steering committee of that, that's 550.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:54| And if we talk about the media, Rebecca sitting out there, is the circulation of Sentinel about 45,065 on the weekends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2754)|
| 0:46:02| Is that more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| But probably less than 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| About 100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| So that's 20% approximately of the people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Now, we know a lot of the people, you know, that's not a lot to be educated for such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| This is radical is an improper term, but a substantial change in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| And how do you reason that a committee of 50 and a committee of 500 was successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:34| Do you all feel satisfied and successful that you're representing all of Knox County with this 500 turning out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:43| Because we looked at this open process during the appointments, and I've got new people to my right and new people to my left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| and it really seemed like the citizens liked that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| And I'm not trying to be judgmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| but how do you feel that 500 in the circulation of the Sentinel being our only daily paper is educating people enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2817)|
| 0:47:05| without these nine public forums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Well, I think the suggestion of the public forums is a very good one in terms of sharing the information going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| and particularly with the provision that it comes before the beginning of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| In answer to the question about representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| this process has been open to anyone who was prepared to spend some time first educating themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| and then hearing other people express their thoughts about that fundamental phrase, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| One question, if you have the opportunity to change the form of government in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| what would be the change that you would make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| And that number of people avail themselves of the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Now, going forward, there's the chance to inform more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| I don't think it's likely that 100 percent, 50 percent, I don't know what the percentage might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| but we continue to make the effort, and this is part of that effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| and we would hope that you would participate in that process as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| as has been suggested by the number of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| So we're opening it to anyone who wants to participate, and the more the merrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| But when you asked your questions, and I guess this is what the commission is asking tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| you brought the recommendations of Knox County, one question, to these pool of 500 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| the ones that want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Do you not think that if they had more than one choice, that they could tweak it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| that we're not maybe expressing that view tonight, or do you think they were just locked in solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| and none of those would ever want or expect any change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Well, I think no matter how many people you have involved, there might be changes over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| What we're faced with, as Kathy has said very well, is a time frame that makes us count back from August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| and to do what has been possible to be done, as she indicated from last May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| and then into September when the information was brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| including the Baker Center report that I think gave us the advantage in this county of the wisdom that has been found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:17| and perhaps mistakes that have been found in a number of other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| So it's not just that we are learning from what people in Knox County are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| We at least have the opportunity to bounce that against the ideas that have been tried, sometimes succeeded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| sometimes failed in other governments across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| So it's a combination of information and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| And this group has done the best job it could do in the time that was available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| and with the resources that were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| And I think it is an absolute representation of the people who came and spoke during those meetings last May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Mr. Don, a couple of comments and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| One is that there's eight of us on this commission tonight that was not here a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| So it is our first chance to really have an official look at what's being presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| I, like most of my colleagues, do agree with a lot of these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:32| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| I think personally it's dangerous when we group these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| I think it's a bad move for your group because of the fact that if there's one that someone doesn't like in the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:48| then it taints the rest of that pool of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| I realize that for you to get nine petitions is a whole lot of signatures, a whole lot of time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:04| Also, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| If this commission voted on seven of the nine to put those on the ballot, what would you do with the remaining two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| We would go forward with the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Would you group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| How would you group those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| If your petition shows that you're going to group this amount and this amount, how are you going to back those out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| Once again, Mr. McAdams may be available to talk about the process of doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| so that it will meet the requirements of the election commission in terms of any changes that might be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| and the certification that would have to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Because obviously what we don't want to have is this group showing up, this group showing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| and then seven of the amendments that people are trying to decipher what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| The dilemma that faces us as well as you is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| Because of the timing, once again, as Kathy referenced, in a perfect world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| we would have another year or so to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| We don't have the luxury of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| But, in fact, the effort has been underway now for almost a year and opportunities, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| on balance for information education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Lynn Fugate is here as well and can speak to the process that has been addressed by several commissioners, most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| Mr. Ballard, in terms of the what-if scenarios, which is what you're raising, Commissioner Daniels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:35| we are dealing with the time constraint and just the ballot constraint as a practical matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| And in a perfect world, it might be some different, but this is what we're faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| Just so you know, I did attend the one at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| What I don't want to see happen here tonight is to see an argument against any one individual ordinance be transformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| in an argument against simplicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| The simplest and best for the voters is to have these nine items go through as written, get on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| and then they vote them up, down, up, down, whichever their preferences are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| I know we have every legal authority to amend, change, improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| but one person's improvement is another person's poison pill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| Why should we restrain ourselves when we hold some really good ideas about how to make them better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| ideas that seem to make sense to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Why should we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Well, I think because we should walk humbly in the path of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| The voters have shown us their displeasure through the past election cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| and they've also shown us through your organization their desire for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| So even though some of these may go up, some of these may go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| even some of these might have arguably better wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| I think we should make a simple process and pass through all nine because if we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| we end up with the situation Commissioner Daniels was describing where we have five to seven of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| and then we have them clumped together where similar items appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| and one might go up and one might go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| It would be very confusing to voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| and then you end up with something that has maybe four major provisions you're trying to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| and you like three and you don't like a fourth, and what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| I don't want us to do that to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I'd rather say, okay, yeah, I think I'm a smart person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| I think I know how I can improve that, but I'm going to hold back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| And I'd rather let the wisdom of the public go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| I'd rather let the voters decide it all because I think your process was adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| I think you brought forward some really good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And even though Elaine raised a good point and Commissioner Leuthold raised a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| all of them raised really good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| I'll even say that Commissioner Lambert raised a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| But, you know, they tell the story in journalism circles about an editor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| and a reporter who hate each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| and they go on vacation trying to bury the hatchet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| And the reporter turns around and he sees the editor at the shore of this beautiful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| pristine lake and he's urinating at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| And he says, the reporter says, what the heck are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| And the editor says, I'm fixing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| What appears to be a good fix to some is not a good fix to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| So let us restrain ourselves, too, in light of what the voters are telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| And let's simply follow the path that Commissioner Hammond outlined of passing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| having hearings, and if you don't like what you hear at the hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| then vote against them on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| But let's get the process done and give you folks enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you, Mr. Parnell, and for your group and all the work that you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| I think I'm going to make some observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| Several of them are similar to what Mark had to say just then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| and certainly our citizens have spoken loudly at the ballot box in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| I think that your process is certainly a continuation of that, of the wishes of the electorate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:25| their frustration that they expressed way back into the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| And, of course, every time you all had a meeting, you experienced the expression of that frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:41| and the desire of that electorate to do things better in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| And that's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| It's just people hoping that this process and that government turns out better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| And I agree with Mark in reference to several of our colleagues on this board that these are good arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| I really like the idea of clarity and simplicity in terms of items to be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| I hate to get inside the curtain and have to think too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| I want to have it thought out pretty well before I get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| I don't want to have to interpret stuff back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| But I think it gets down to me, at least as I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| This debate, which we may say needs to be taking place up here and amendments and such as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:36| I just don't think that's where the debate needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| And the debate is going to be in the community when this gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| And so I'm all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| You guys have studied this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| You know the constitutionality of these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| You have done your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| I'm ready to go forward with this and vote for it to proceed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| Now, let's see, what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| There was another question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Do we represent Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| I think Mr. Ballard said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| And that might be an issue about the five or 600, and Scott brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| Certainly, those we're going to represent Knox County in this process before it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| It's going to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| The people are going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| And people are going to be concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| They're going to be overwhelmingly concerned with this referendum and all these proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| just as they were with that turnout that we had in this last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| So we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I know we've got some other lights on, and I want you to get to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| But I want to call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| and I want to make sure what the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| We've been debating for quite a while here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| and it appears to me as though we're debating and about to vote on whether we're going to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| and vote on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Is that the question on the table right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| The law director has said that we cannot lump them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| So I guess my substitute motion would be that we take ordinance number 101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| and approve it on first reading with a workshop to be held by this commission March 12th at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| And, again, should these items be approved on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| that there would be a minimum of nine public forums to be held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| one in each district to be hosted by the commissioners from the individual district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| time and place to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| And there could be even more, but there would be a minimum of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| And 101 is the one about basically going back to the old standard for how many petitions citizens needed to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| I'd like to second that motion, and I'd like to speak in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| Even under the old standard, we were under that with the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| It was still a very difficult task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| And I think that the standard that exists now is an impossible task for grassroots organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3611)|
| 1:00:21| It's a task for a well-funded organization that can hire professional petitioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| but it is an impossible task for a group of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| So I want to speak in favor of 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| I second Mr. Hammond's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| and I think we need to pass this to give citizens the option to petition their own government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| So, and I call for the question on 101 after these lights, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Commissioner Lambert, we already have a second to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| And, John, could we do, if we split Elaine's question and make a new resolution and amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3656)|
| 1:01:05| would that be the will of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Could we do that, or would it require a two-thirds vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| Just to split the question, would not require a two-thirds vote, but it takes two-thirds to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| It takes two-thirds to pass both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| When that comes up, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Commissioner Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| I've got one here that I'm a little concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| It's just Inspector General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| I can't see any difference in the duties of this than the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| We really were asking that the office of the internal auditor be replaced with the office of the Inspector General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3715)|
| 1:02:03| And the only difference that we saw, we wanted to make sure that there was no perception by the public of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:15| lack of independence with the process that we laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| Basically, what we ask is that the purchasing department would put out a request for proposals for a request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:30| submission of resumes for anyone who was interested in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| That the interviews would be taken place by the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| and that a recommendation then would be made that would be approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| We ask that the Inspector General be appointed for a period of time that would exceed that period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:56| of the body that appointed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| And we felt like that that would put in place a greater perception of independence perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| than we have with an internal auditor that reports either to the commission or to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| But I feel like we've got a good auditor here and I feel like it's been a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| I don't see him aligned with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| And Commissioner, the group does too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| And we have said as we discussed that in other areas when the question came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| the group certainly didn't mean to suggest that the current internal auditor could not apply for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| We wanted to make it clear that the individual in that position was in place for a set term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| and a set period of time unless you had any reason to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| Well, let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| In this report we've got here, this is the only position that you have the salary in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3831)|
| 1:04:00| The others do not have the salary, you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| But you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| It's tied in with the law director's salary to be what he makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| It's $144,480 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| We're creating a bureaucracy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| This whole staff that the auditor has right now, their salary and his whole staff just totals $156,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| So we're starting one man out, not counting the employees that he's going to have, with almost what this whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:32| Well, I think that the reason that a salary was put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| and tied to another individual was strictly because of research done by the group as far as what they think would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| need to be put out there to attract a high level of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:49| But I just found it odd that that's the only one that we have in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| And I find it odd that that's coming through the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| He gives the criteria for you to hold, I believe, doesn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Doesn't the mayor have the criteria to give to the purchasing department of what we're putting out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| Well, the purchasing department would put out the basically just a request for individuals to submit a resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| that then goes through the ethics department or the ethics committee to make the interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| What we really tried to do, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| is to spread out the number of people in the groups that are looking at that position and to bring somebody in for interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:28| Mr. Pinkston, can I interject something as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| You brought up a good point about the inspector general being tied to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| but you've got another proposed ordinance here that does away with an elected law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| makes it an appointed law director, which would be underneath the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| And so does that not all of a sudden tie what comes back to what is a salary and how are they tied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:58| I mean, it's just some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| I mean, these are the things that I just think that we should take the time to take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| where some of these things conflict with each other, some things conflict with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| and some things, quite frankly, just don't make good sense in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Chairman, I've got one more quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| I'm not through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Do we not have, is there not going to be a public debate on this the 13th of March here in this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| Thirteenth of March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Are you talking about Mr. Hammond's 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| I heard there was going to be a public debate on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| Mr. Parnell, do you know anything about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Only with reference to the proposal I believe that Commissioner Hammond made a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| No, this is something other than Commissioner Hammond's March 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| Does anybody here from PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| I think this room was reserved either the 12th or the 13th for a public debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| I have written down the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| That's what I thought it was, the 13th, for a public debate on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| So it seems to me like we're getting ahead of the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| and I believe this is a citizen group that's setting this debate up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| You don't know anything about it, Mr. Parnell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| I don't have that date on anything that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Yes, Mr. Parnell, I have a real concern with what I'm hearing tonight about we're talking about having forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| but yet you're not willing to change any of the language once those forums take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| because citizens want to be involved in the process and they want to give their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| And I believe that we have had such an upswelling of citizen involvement since all of this has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| and I think you'll probably have more than 500 people's opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| And I'd like to make sure that we get to hear those people's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| Mr. Daniels and I have just been recently appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| and we've not had an opportunity to meet with any constituents in our district to get their feeling and their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:18| But what I'm hearing from you, sir, is even when we do get their feedback, that it's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| It's just going to be mainly an explanation of this is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| You can either vote for it or vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| And I don't feel that that really involves the citizens in this process, and that gravely concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Well, and I understand and appreciate your concerns, as we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| And once again, there are time constraints that have led us to this schedule that's been laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| And to the extent that any of those forums, any meetings, any information sessions can occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| that will occur within the time frame that we have to deal with and that you have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| then we absolutely welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| We have welcomed that over the last year that this process has been underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| So I hope that you won't see it as a rejection of further citizen participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| but as an acceptance of the fact of the schedule and an acceptance of the participation that comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| But we're faced with the schedule as it is, not necessarily as we would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| I understand that you're talking about scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| but you're still not addressing the fact that we would like to be able to change some of the language of these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| And that's what I would like to make sure that we have your cooperation with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| You certainly, as a county commission, have the opportunity to make whatever changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| to follow Commissioner Harmon's suggestion of adopting them as they are, to make changes in one, to make changes in any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| But at the end of the day, the process that we have, we have significant constraints in terms of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:07| and compliance with the election commission because the election commission must determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| and Mr. McAdams again can address this, but there's a whole process in place that we are required to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| We can't pass two votes and go on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| We have to comply with state law in terms of filing petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| So I hope that you will appreciate that just from the process that we have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| as perhaps opposed to the process that you have available to you as county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| But we understand the concern that you're raising about public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| We welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| We certainly welcome it within the constraints of the time that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| The question I have is I participated at the South Doyle Forum early, a long, long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| I don't recall some of these being brought about at that forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| For example, I know in our forum at the very end we were divided into rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| and then each room decided on key issues and then we were all brought together and decided on the top issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:22| I remember mentioning two at-large county commission member seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| I do remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| However, I don't remember anything in our group brought about restructuring the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| I don't recall anything about an inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| And I heard Kathy Hamilton reference your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| So does that, is item 106, is this more of, is this generated from your group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| and not necessarily from the public forums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Well, I recall that there were several different public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| And the input that came came from each of those individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| and then came finally to the Knox County One Question Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| So in terms of the process, let me ask Lynn Fugate to help address that question that you've raised in terms of how the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:12| that came from individual meetings then eventually came together to form what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| So really what you're telling me is that this did not really come from a consensus of 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| It could possibly have come from maybe 200 or maybe even from 50 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Well, what it did come from is a meeting of citizens who came out to public forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| to express their views to the very question, if you have the opportunity to change Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| what would you change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| So there was weighting available for each of the groups, whether there was 100 present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| or 50 present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| The process was set up to accommodate anyone and everyone who came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Did someone record the minutes from those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Because I remember being in the library, there was like three main things that we all had to agree upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| So are those minutes available for us to review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| Let me ask Lynn to address that, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| Lynn Fugate, 530 Mellon Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| I believe that all the ideas that were generated from those meetings are on the Knox County One Question website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| identified by meeting site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| They are not a tally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| There's not a tally on there, but every idea that came from those meetings is listed there from the five different sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:37| I don't know if that answers your question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| They were ranked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| That information, I believe, is also on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| I haven't looked at it in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| I'm not a part of the petition group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I just facilitated the public meetings and then recused myself so that they could operate without any cloud of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:57| having directed the facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| And I have the disadvantages, as several of us do, because we're all new and we just got appointed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| With all this stuff to consider, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| The question came earlier, do we have the list of everyone that attended the meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| Registration was taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Those forms were turned into an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| I will have to see if those were kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| I do not know if the sign-in sheets were kept after I did the public meetings, but we will check on that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| I was going to try to address several issues that may have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| and I know there's been one issue on whether maybe the meetings were packed with the same group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| regardless of where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| But really to look at how the entire process was for Knox County, one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| My understanding of it is that it wasn't just through public forums that these charter amendments were derived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| but also from the Baker Center study where they looked at cohort counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| and it's what we call in medicine best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| And some of those ideas looked at counties that seemed to be working well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| and what were they doing regarding accountability and how the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| and the executive branch process worked in each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| And I think some of those ideas were derived from those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| and didn't originate de nouveau necessarily at the forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| I have looked at the website recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| and I believe if you click on each of the sites where the forums occurred, and this is to address that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| they do have I got the impression that what it was is that every citizen that stood up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| or made a recommendation, some of them were reasonable, some of them maybe were not so reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| but they're all listed there on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| There's about 150 or 160 page summary of the entire process that really goes over what the Baker Center did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4553)|
| 1:16:04| That regards how other cohort counties are doing the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| but probably the best one to read is the executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| It doesn't take so long, and I think it's very well written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| The other issue that I had, there's been some question about the legality of the charter amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| and I thought that in the Jordan versus Knox County opinion that came out in January of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:31| that really what that said was that home rule would predominate over most of the state laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| and that the county could decide how they wish to rule themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| That was at least my interpretation of what that said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| It wasn't just the question of term limits, but it was the question of how a county can rule itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| And that was really what it asserted was the right of home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| The only other issue that I have or question that I would like to bring up regards to the March 12th, 8 a.m. meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4615)|
| 1:17:03| just deals again with how much public participation you can have at that time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| You know, many of the public have jobs, and that's a very, very difficult time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| And I would only question would we want to change that to maybe sometime in the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| where the public could participate more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| So I don't know if we got an answer to Commissioner Briggs' statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| He made the statement that some of the data did not come from the public process but came from best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| Let me ask Lawrence Tullock to address the Knox County one question process as it relates both to Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| as well as Commissioner DeVries' questions and points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Commissioner McKenzie, we have a history and a timeline that we could either give to each of you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| or we could give it to you after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| We anticipated that the more substantive discussion on all these would actually occur at a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| So we've not passed that out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| But where the Knox County one question recommendations came from was on May 14th, 15th, 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| 21st, and 22nd, 2007, there were five public meetings in all areas of the county, northeast, southwest, and central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:26| The ideas, that's the intuitive part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| The ideas that came from the citizens at that time were all cataloged and prioritized at each of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| In addition to that, simultaneously, the Seven Islands Foundation funded the Baker Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| Howard Baker Center at the University of Tennessee to do two things, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| One was to do a research project on existing conditions in local government in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| and to do best practice research, as Commissioner Briggs indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| of 160 cohort counties from around the country outside of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| The Baker Center did that totally independent of Knox County one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| They were funded totally independent of Knox County one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| It was totally independent, nonpartisan research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| They developed certain themes of best practices from counties around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| Now, all this started not because of any problems that were going on at that time in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| It started because of what Commissioner Briggs talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| which was a Supreme Court decision on January 12th, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| that did say for the first time in Knox County's 215-year history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| that you could look at changing some things that had never been possibly looked at changing prior to that in its entire history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:44| things that were previously in the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| And what the Supreme Court held was that Knox County voters, by their vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| had the power to change their charter in any way they wanted to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| That's what upheld term limits is also what has made this entire thing possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| So, in August, there was a retreat, full day retreat, of a 56-person steering committee that represented all parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:15| They took the intuitive input of the five public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| They took the best practice research of Howard Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| They came at the end of the day with a unanimous set of recommendations for changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| If there was not consensus in the room about a particular change, it was not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| There was absolute unanimous agreement to go forward with the changes that were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:40| We provided that report to commission and eight of you were not here, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| But we provided that report to commission on September 9th, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| At that time, the language for charter amendments from that report were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| We waited from September 9th, 2007 to January 28th, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| This commission, without the eight of you present, took no action whatsoever moving those charter amendments forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| On January 28th, we filed with the Knox County Election Commission to start the petition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| We have not asked you to vote on these one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| What we've said is the voters deserve for you to vote on these as nine separate issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| because that's the best way for them to be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| We have the ability to circulate two charter petitions, physically and financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| We couldn't possibly circulate nine charter petitions to get 40,000 signatures each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| It would be impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| In addition to that, the election commission would take about $35,000 to count the signatures for each charter petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:58| Now, if this commission wants that process to go forward, it will go forward on March 18th as we've set it in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:08| If the commission, on the other hand, wants the voters to vote on nine separate issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| they have every power within their disposal to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| We would ask you just to give us an answer one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| because we're prepared to adjust based on what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| But that's really the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| You know, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Lawrence, what are you going to adjust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| What could you adjust?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| I've heard nothing but inflexibility upon your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Well, let's take some examples, Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| If we knew before March 18th that you were willing to put seven of the nine on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| we would go forward with two petitions for one issue on one and one issue on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| That's the way we could adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| There are a lot of different ways we could adjust, but not if we don't know anything about it before March 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| Once March 18th occurs, we've got certified petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| We've got 75 days to get signatures on those petitions or they will not be on the ballot in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| So that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| And remember, from September 9th through January 28th, you had this information before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:22| Commissioner Leuthold, you took no action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| So I definitely empathize with you on that, and that is not a good thing that we did not take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:36| However, I guess I do have just slight wording issues with a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| So I guess in terms of a question, as we vote on these one by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| do we have an opportunity to ask questions at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| or do you want to kind of go through them in one batch, Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5034)|
| 1:24:03| We have to go through them one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| In terms of having a debate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| That's the only way we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| It is not politically correct to kind of get to the bottom line sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| but I'd like to kind of get to a bottom line, if I might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| and just show you how my mind and my thought process is working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| I remember when a group of petitioners got together to fight the downtown hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| and a number of people in the community said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| oh, they'll never get those signatures on that hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| That hotel is going to go regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Well, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| They got the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| The wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| I remember folks saying they'll never get those petitions on the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| But guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| To me, it depends on how motivated the people are to get these petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5095)|
| 1:25:03| and get them signed because it's not an easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| I will tell you, these people are motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| These folks are going to get these petitions if we don't list them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| Now, the way my mind works is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| Knowing that they're going to get these petitions because look at the work they've already put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| Look at the money that they have already expended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| Look at the time and effort they've put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Now, whether we agree with them or not and whether we agree with the wording or not, they're motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| I suspect and I believe firmly they will get those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| So if we don't do anything or if we come in and decide that we don't want to do whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| we decide to do, the voters in August will vote on two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| One would be an executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| One would be for the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| And when those voters vote, that's going to be the law in Knox County, whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| Because the Supreme Court, in my view, said very clearly the citizens of Knox County can change their government by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5171)|
| 1:26:20| And so it's going to be up to the voters then to decide if they want to reject them, maybe one or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| maybe neither one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| But if they do, then we're going to be sitting here after that election at 2010 with two petitions that have been voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:37| rather than nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| So, again, the way my thought process is I would much rather have the citizens vote on nine and piecemeal them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| and then determine which of these they want to vote on and which they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Now, again, sometimes it's not politically correct to get real, but I want to get real here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| They're not interested in us changing their petitions, unless I'm misreading the situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:06| And, again, I'm just trying to be up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| I think what you're interested in is you've put a lot of time and a lot of effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| You've brought forth what you believe are good, solid improvements to Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and you want the voters to vote on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| And so we can spend a lot of time trying to change language, trying to change this, trying to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| But my sense is that's not really what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| You're looking for us to go ahead and put these on, either all nine of them, and if we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| you're moving ahead with your petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| I think you're motivated, and I think you'll get your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| So I think the ball is in our court to determine how we want to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| We can do nothing, and you're still going to put this on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| And it's going to be on the ballot, and it's going to be on the ballot in favor of the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| with those nine parts in place to vote on, or it's going to be squeezed into two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| And that doesn't serve us as a community, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| Now, just as an aside, I would like for the workshop in reference to the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| I think the Baker Center has tried to maintain their independence in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:15| They haven't been intermeshed or enmeshed in the normal one-question movement and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| And I would like to request that representatives from the Baker Center attend the workshop in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| you know, as an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| My name is Bradley Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| I would like to voice my concern over the inspector general section of this movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:54| What I think a lot of people have failed to realize is that by having an appointed inspector general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| the way that this is structured, you may have a position that our mayor won't be caught in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| because, you know, he leaves office in 2010, I believe it is, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| But in the future, you may have positions where there are audits involving the mayor's office in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| hypothetically, and where the inspector general has to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| In that situation, we're going to find ourselves where we have the administrator of the county's contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:34| appointing who gets to audit himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| And that can cause some serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| I don't think that we need to have any input from the administration of the contracts involving Knox County coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| from anybody other than Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| simply because Knox County Commission is not directly involved in the implementation of our contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| Right now, that office is Richard Walls' office, the office of the county auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| and the executive branch or the mayor's branch has no input into how he is appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| That gave an excellent position of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| Here recently, Richard has not felt one bit out of the way to audit any contract that comes across his table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:23| And we're going to create a situation where in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| if you had someone hypothetically pass away at an untimely time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| or during the middle of an administration, you could have someone appointing their own auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Now, I've never been audited in my life, but Lord forbid if I ever do become audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| I doubt that the IRS or any other agency would let me participate in appointing who audits me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Commissioner Freese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| Yes, can we go ahead and make a motion to go ahead and tackle the first resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| and get this ball rolling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| It's already been, I think it's already been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| Then can we call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Well, we as commissioners keep turning our lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Tank, after we vote on this one, can we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| There's some folks that have been waiting a mighty long time to speak to us out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| And then go back and tackle them one at a time and stick to the subject as each one comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| No, I think we need to finish this and we'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| I'll make a ruling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| My light was on to say let's start voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| Response to Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| Charter versus state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Let's talk about the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| Let's talk about what the term limit provision within our charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| The term limit provision that was passed by the voters in 1994 said to term limit all Knox County elected offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:09| including judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| The Supreme Court came back and said you cannot term limit school board member and you cannot term limit judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| So the Supreme Court did put parameters around what we can and cannot override within our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:29| So there's still this possibility about some of these things that are in conflict with state law that our charter cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| supersede because the Supreme Court did say there are limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| What are those limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Which state laws are we going to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Which ones are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Which ones does our charter supersede?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Which ones do they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| I would like to be able to present to the public, to the voters, things that we are certain are lawful and are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5575)|
| 1:33:04| in our charter, not things that we think or possibly are legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| And I think these are questions that we should try to seek answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| Another question I have, Lawrence, is that the cities and the counties that the Baker study looked at, did they ever take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:26| a look and study their tax structure and how are they compared to other communities as far as how their taxes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:36| Because it seems to me, I recall that they called them progressive communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| In my book, progressive has always meant higher tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| So has anybody studied those governments to see how their tax structure compared to ours and to other communities around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5626)|
| 1:33:57| The Baker Center research was independent of Knox County in one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| and you'd have to ask that question to the Baker Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| There are two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| There's one way that I know that they'll answer you, and that is if you will submit your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| they will answer you in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I think you just heard Commissioner Norman also make a request that they appear at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| We'll transmit that request to them, and hopefully they'll appear at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| I think that would be something that the community would find very informative is to find out whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| or not these other governments, if they have higher taxes or lower taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:38| So just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| We have a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| We have to take each one of them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| So we're talking about 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| Let me also address the reason I mentioned 8 a.m. on the 12th was because this is a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| I was told it was a commission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| If we want to have a public workshop, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| I mean, this is not no pride of ownership here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| We can do it in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| We can even do it on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| But I think it would be helpful for us as a commission to meet just with us because, as you can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| there are a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| And then we could also have another public get together where the public could come on an evening or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Well, that was what I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| State your substitute motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| That we approve ordinance 101 with a commission workshop to be held at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| on March the 12th here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| It would be obviously televised so everyone would be able to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| And then should we have or should this be passed on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| there would be a minimum of nine public forums, one to be held in each commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| Before the start of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| Commissioner Hammond, are you going to have to add that to all the resolutions or is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| It will be added to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| One at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| So I didn't know if we could just possibly pass that and then we'd only have to then pass each of these on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:14| without having to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| I'll just split the question so we don't have to do it each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| But let's go ahead and vote on the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| And then the second one I'll have as a resolution to have the workshop and also the public forums be a separate item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| I just think it makes it easier so we could pass that one time, that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| and then we just vote on the ordinances as they come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| Makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| We split the question so we would vote first on the one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| Let's do the second part, the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| Commission workshop, Wednesday morning, 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Also, should this pass on second reading, there would be a minimum of nine public forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| There could be more to be hosted by the commissioners of each individual district with a time and place to be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| before early voting begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| Are we going to require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| This would apply to all nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| With regards to these forums, are we going to require any sort of minutes or is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Are we going to collect information to bring back or what's the structure of these forums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| These forums would be for these folks to come and answer any questions that the public would have about the individual amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| So, yes, there would probably be someone from the clerks or someone there to record the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| and make a record of the fact that it was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| And you're making this as a separate item so that it's not part of the one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| It's just a separate item so we don't have to vote on it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Isn't it more up to this organization to hold forums to try to, and organizations opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| to hold forums trying to convince people for and against these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| I think we can really leave that up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Well, this is an informational thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| and I thought it would be nice for each of us to have one in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| The commissioners could host it, bring whoever you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| but this would be an opportunity for any citizen to come and ask any question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| You could determine the forum and determine how it would be held and when and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| And obviously, if any group out there wishes to hold their own forums, they're capable of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| If we're going to have these in each of the districts, then they need to be, we need to use media outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| And then if we're going to have the clerk there, and if it's going to, are we going to have them televised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| Do we need to do what we did prior to the appointment process and outline all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| and have it televised, have a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| and have it in the media for the people to know where these are in case they miss one in their own district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| To have it televised, you would need to be at a location where that would be technically possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| We had most of them here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| If you had them out and you went to a high school that had a capability of TV so that they could do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:05| the TV stations would be able to pick up feeds that way, maybe use remote control units to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| But, yes, bottom line is it is possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| We're going to split the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Second part of the question is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Mr. Chairman, I think it's a completely separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| It's not two questions being divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| It's one separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| Standing alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Standing alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| It's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Yes, it's been rephrased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| What separate question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| Simple resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| It's a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| And the motion is that we will have a workshop on March the 12th at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| There will be nine forums in each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Prior to early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Prior to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Prior to the start of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Prior to the start of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| We all understand the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| Well, we've made some headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| Now, what's the other part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| No, we're just on 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| Read into the 101, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| This is to amend Article 9 of the Knox County Charter to designate the number of qualified voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:37| required to sign petitions for charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| Knox County Charter has adopted 11.888 as amended through referendum of 8.604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| Intergovernmental voted no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| 8.60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| Vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Do we need someone, probably need someone to explain each one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| Or do you want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| We've been over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| Well, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Do we all understand what 101 is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| I think everybody understands 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| Well, just for the people at home, if you'll tell them what the percentage was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| or what the percentage is now, and what this ordinance would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| Mr. Parnell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| I think we can shed a little light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Lawrence can describe the process as it exists now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| and what the opportunity is given this proposal for 15 percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Kathy Stilhart, I didn't think she was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| This is to change the number of voter signatures required to bring a citizen petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| At the time that the original charter was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| it was a percentage of those voting in the last general county election, or was it general government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:05| General government election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| General government election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| And now it is a percentage of the total registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| So this is to take the number back to what it was at the time that the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| So it's to bring it down to whatever the last gubernatorial election, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| That voted in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Instead of 15 percent of total registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Total registered voters, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Oh, it's going from total registered voters down to gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| Those that voted in the last gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| That's what this ordinance is for, gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Kathy, what city and stuff did you take this out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| Who had this or did you all just come up with the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| This was not from the Baker Center report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| This was from the citizens after they found out that there had been a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| and that it had increased to the number of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| I think it was a change that most of the citizens that participated in our process had not been aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| What was the group's rationale to make it less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| Because then we could just get any kind of fibrous petition if you make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| I think that basically there was not the feeling that going out to get that percentage of the voters that had voted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| last election was an easy mark and that being required to get that percentage of all registered voters was a bar maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:38| higher than it should be for the citizens to be able to bring something to be put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| Kathy, what is our number of registered voters now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| I should know that, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| Just a second, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| I can't tell you off the top of my head, but we do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| About 220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| While they're looking for that, actually the change that had occurred was due to a change elsewhere in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| that affected the ability not only in Knox County, but in other counties in terms of the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6247)|
| 1:44:14| That change elsewhere in the state resulted in the 15 percent of registered voters, as opposed to what it had been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| which is what is now being proposed, to return it in Knox County to what it had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| It's 231.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| 231,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| 231,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| And then what do you anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I mean, what is gubernatorial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| What are those elections running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| What kind of numbers are those running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| It would take it, in this particular instance, it would take the required number of signatures from being about 40,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| to being somewhere around about 15,000 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| Mr. Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| I want to speak in favor of this, having participated in one of those petition drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| Under the old standards, citizens could petition their government, and it was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| It was hard, very, very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| But it was possible for a small citizen group to petition their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| Under the standard we have today, which requires considerably more signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| a well-financed group can petition their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| A group that has the money to hire a professional petitioning company can achieve that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| What this is doing is it's going back to the old standard where common, everyday citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| dedicated to a cause, can achieve putting a charter amendment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| And I think that's a good thing, because what it does, it gives more power to the individual people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| Right now organizations can meet the standard, but, honestly, it would be nearly impossible for a small citizen group to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| And that's why I'm in favor of 101, and I hope everyone will vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6368)|

| 1:46:24| Ordinance 102 is amending Article 2, Article 6, and Article 9 of the Knox County Charter to add two at-large county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6384)|

| 1:46:59| Overall, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| Move to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| Move that we adopt this as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Not that I'm for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| I plan on fighting this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| But I do believe the citizens have a right to choose it as far as the size of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| My problem with this as far as the aligning the commission and the school board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| don't we have a redistricting coming up in what about 2012, 2010, 2012, somewhere around in there anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:35| Every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| After the new census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| After the new census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| You know, I mean, we all live and I have overlap with different state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| I have overlap with different school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| You're not going to ever be able to align all government together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| And so I don't see any reason why we should do this with the school board when we can't do it with the state senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| and the state representatives and other, you know, branches of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| I think we need to continue to have separate districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| And I just think it makes it a lot less complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| But I do believe the people have a right to choose whether they want to shrink the size of their legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| So I'm offering that as a substitute motion with that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| What is your substitute motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| To go ahead and put this on as it sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| And, again, not to say that I'm in favor of it because I certainly am not, but to remove the redistricting aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:40| The aligning the school board and the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| Anyone want to second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| Or I can split that if Elaine would be willing to second it if I split it into two different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:56| Mr. Chairman, I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Anyone want to second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6537)|
| 1:48:58| I have a comment that goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| I'd rather talk about that before I second it or not, if that would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| As far as aligning the school board and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| I believe this ordinance gives the power of drawing the boundaries to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| But it's my understanding that state law allows the school board the right to draw their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:34| It's a city to draw the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| So how do we get around the state law that grants school board their right to draw their own boundaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:49| Unless we just want to hand over the drawing of the boundaries to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| I would not be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| Is there someone that would like to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Mr. McAdams is here and can address some of the issues in terms of the redistricting requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| that are already in the law after the decennial census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| and how that relates to the drafting of the school boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| The Knox County Charter currently provides that the school board will set the school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| That's a violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| The Tennessee Code provision that sets up school boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| which are state school boards with local functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| specifically says that the local legislative body will set the school board districts, not the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| So that's a flaw within our own charter that gives the right to the school board to draw their own boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| That is a conflict with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Well, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| I had a question for Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| I had one more point, and that had to do with the size of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:08| Mr. Law Director, does the charter not give this body the right to change the size of this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:18| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Provided that it's for, I think it's between, what, nine and 25 or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| We could change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| I believe we have the right to change the size of this commission just by us voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:34| Instead of having to take it to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| I believe it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| You can do it by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| You can do it by charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| I was talking about population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Well, they've got three in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6716)|
| 1:52:06| It can only be done through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| The charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| The charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Right now your membership, it is set up through the charter through Section 2.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:21| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| This is just, I guess, a point of clarification in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| As I read the way that the districts elect, it looks like two candidates have gone to the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6749)|
| 1:52:38| Are you all saying that the general is a countywide election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| Are you trying to look more like city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Is that the intent here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| I missed the first part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| The process has a primary election, nonpartisan primary election with the top two vote getters going to the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6770)|
| 1:53:02| Is that a countywide general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Are you all trying to look more like city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| Because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| Commissioner McKenzie, the district representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| First of all, this changes it to where the voters vote for three of 11 commissioners rather than two of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:22| One would be elected by district, and it would be elected in a nonpartisan fashion, similar to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:31| But it would, the final vote would still be just by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| Okay, so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Just by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| The district representative would be run in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| If there was a vote, a candidate that got more than 50 percent of the vote in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| they would be elected in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| If not, the top two vote getters would go to the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| But it would still only be elected by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| The at-large representatives would be elected countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Let me speak to Commissioner Leuthold's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| Section 2.03A2 does allow this body, upon a two-thirds vote of its membership, to change its commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:19| And it may have more, as much to do with redistricting as anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| But you can change the number of commission districts to not less than nine, no more than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| The members shall not be less than nine, no more than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| And each seat is a separate office and not more than three members shall be elected for any one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| So we could tonight, if we wanted to, we could change this with a two-thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| change the size of this commission if we thought that was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| Now, if that's the way our charter says, no more than three per district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:06| is it even legal for us to-for this to pass if it were on the-it wouldn't be in conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6906)|
| 1:55:17| You're rewriting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| You're rewriting it by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| But I think state law says it's got to be between the nine and 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| and I think that's why the charter came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| That comes right out of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| Well, as you know, when I first came on board here, all of you older commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| I said we should go to nine commissioners, you know, with one just for each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:48| But, boy, was I naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| I'm going to tell you, instead of cutting these, we need to expand the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| to give the people more power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| I found out that up here when you cut it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| the people that gain the power of this commission is not the little everyday working man out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| It's the rich and powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| I think most of you seen in this last election that we had agreed everybody was tainted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:17| with January the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| But we had $4,500 to give in these commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| and I think everybody's seen how that helped them in their campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| Regardless of what you want to think and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| the people normally that raise the most money win these commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| If we get it down to nine, then all they have to do is have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| Then the two at large will normally be elected out of the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| I can't be for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Like I said, I was really naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| And I know the secretaries and all the older commissioners up here heard me say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| we just need nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| But I was very, very naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| Commissioner Ivan, you turned your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| Let me dovetail a bit of what Paul just said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| And, William, I'm going to use you as an example on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| I feel I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Paul, I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| You know, I get phone calls every single day and even on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:28| I don't mind the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| And I'm sure Commissioner Moore is getting the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| You take Commissioner Moore out of my district, that's that many more phone calls from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:38| I'll say William is the at-large, he's the at-large candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| And I get a question out in my area for the north end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| And these people that are serving citywide or countywide, they're going to depend on me first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| I mean, we're all busy and we're part-time legislatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| And he's going to think in his or her mind out there, well, that commissioner out there will handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| And I won't really have to worry with that because I'm at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| and I don't have to really jump on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| And that just puts more on the individual candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| But to go down to the one per district, it's just really going to swamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| I know, Tony, you've mentioned in the past that I'll be a full-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| If you do something like that, you might want to look at that going full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| But that's just going to put, in my opinion, more work on the one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| And then I agree with you what you said about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| It'll only take five people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| So those are good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| I'm just not pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| You know, I'm known for my candor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| You know, where's Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| You know, Don, you don't seem to have any answers to a lot of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| I'm real disturbed about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| One thing that I see by looking at this process is it's your committee here, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7132)|
| 1:59:00| Your committee people are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| And that's great and they're all behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| And I agree with what Commissioner Lutho said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| A lot of what he's saying is, guys, I don't hear the citizens speaking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| They're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Yeah, you said that they did some of these workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| I also went to the workshop and was a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| From what I see, Don, I see your group here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| but I don't see the public just beating out and crying and saying, you know, we want this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| And, Don, here's the big tell-tale sign for me too that I have heard in the last month to six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7171)|
| 1:59:40| I've not heard one person that's for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Not one person has come to me and said, you know, I'm really for this or I'm really for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| You know, I think you guys got an uphill battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| I agree with a lot what's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| Some things I like, some things I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| But I don't like what Commissioner Lutho said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| You guys are cramming it down our throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| And the fact that, you know, why can't we do this in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| You know, it's got to be done in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| I mean, there's elections down the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| I don't see you guys working with this body whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| I mean, we work with zoning issues all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| And the developer will say, well, let me postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| Let's get the people together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| You know, I don't see your group wanting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| I keep going to the flexibility question that Commissioner Lutho was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| You know, you guys don't seem to have any leeway in what you're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| And that's just setting the wrong tone for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| I mean, I want to accomplish some of these things that you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| But it looks like some of this stuff, guys, you haven't done your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| Because a lot of directors are saying a lot of this stuff is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| And, you know, I've got problems with some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| But then again, I'm wanting to let the --I'm letting it turn over to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| and let the heat off of me and let the voters turn you guys down on a lot of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| It's the way I look at some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| And then it's not fair to the, I think, to the new commissioners that we've just got appointed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| I think it puts a lot of stress on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| But, you know, I think that we can handle it and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| But I'm just not really thrilled with the process and how it's being done, not to say that I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| But I just really, Craig, what you said, you hit a lot of home runs with a lot of comments that you were making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| And I don't like the nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| We're taking nonpartisan out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| You know, it's we're going to see what's trying to be like the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| You know, every now and then the county does something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| I'd like to add that, you know, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| I'd take that as a friendly amendment to remove the partisanship portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7294)|
| 2:01:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| I guess the question is, with regards to this, we do have it in the charter where the county commission could change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Do we want the county commission to make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| And do we want just a handful of people to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Or do we want the voters to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| To me, that's the bottom line here is do we want the voters to have an opportunity to vote on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| I have misgivings about this one as well because I can tell you that if you have one commissioner per district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| it's really, really nice to know that a Commissioner Luthold or a Commissioner Briggs could go to a homeowner meeting if I can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| Or if there is a luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| Or if there is some type of school activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| At least there's someone who is available to go because they like to have representatives there from their commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| I think the other thing that you're looking at is you're moving toward a full-time commission job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| I can tell you this job is not ten hours a week or 20 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| Sometimes it is a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| So I have misgivings about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| And I think this is the debate that needs to be happened between now and August when the voters vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| But I'm willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| I'm willing to have that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| I'm willing to have the public come forward and ask questions, challenge you folks, ask you the tough questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| and say, why do we need to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Why is this such a good thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| Maybe it's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| Maybe they'll vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| Maybe they'll vote it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| But I think they deserve an opportunity to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| And so it doesn't really matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| This is just me talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| It doesn't matter what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| I have misgivings about some of these as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| I don't really know that I support some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| But I do believe that the citizens should have an opportunity to vote these up or vote these down in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| I'd like to echo a lot that Commissioner Hammond just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| One of the questions I had about this one, it seems like we lumped a lot of things in here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| particularly about trying to align the school board districts with the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| And I believe that there's two and maybe three of the present school board members that would either have to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| or lose their seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| And you lose a lot of institutional knowledge because they don't have term limits on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| We talked a little earlier about splitting this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Is that still on the table or are we still just going to present this as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| I'm still looking for a second for mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| I'm willing to either split it off or just scratch it completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| And I'm still waiting on a second if you'd like to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| My proposal is that we pass it minus the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| And then R. Larry amended it with removing the provision that removes the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:23| What I need is that it's non-partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| So you're wanting to make it to where the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| I want to simplify it for the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| Now, I want to make it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| I am not in favor of limiting the size of this legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| I am not in favor of adding at-large seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| I do trust the public and I do trust the public to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| And I'm willing to let this go on the ballot for them to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| provided that we scratch the provision that we align the districts with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| for some of the reasons that Commissioner Briggs mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| And also provided that we continue to have our regular partisan primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| I think this county and this country has a long tradition of partisanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| And I think it's the way people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| I think in the city, even though it's a, quote, non-partisan election, people continue to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7526)|
| 2:05:33| I work the polls for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| I worked for Councilman Hall a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| They ask the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| Is he a Democrat or a Republican?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| You know, so that's why I'm going along with R. Larry on scratching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| I would like to second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| And probably move to second that Commissioner Lambert wants to, what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7551)|
| 2:06:02| Scratch the provision that it aligns school board and commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| and scratch the provision that we go to non-partisan primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| It's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| I'm going to try one more time to say that I think we should have a public forum first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| It's 11 o'clock at night and we're up here and we've got eight new people that's never even seen any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7584)|
| 2:06:31| And we've got, what, six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| We've been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| Well, I know you've been involved, but you're going to be sitting here voting on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| that you probably haven't talked to any of your constituents about yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| And, you know, I don't think 11 o'clock at night is the time to have a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| I mean, I started at six o'clock this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| We need to realize that the One Question Best Practice Group is not interested in us putting amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7610)|
| 2:06:57| They want it as it is on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| They're not interested in our amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| And if we put amendments on, they're going, if I'm not mistaken, you're going on and get the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7623)|
| 2:07:10| So I guess, Mr. Chairman, let's just vote these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| Let's vote them down and let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| I think everybody here knows on everyone if they want to vote them up or vote them down, put them on a ballot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| Without the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Mr. Parnell, am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| We would agree with Commissioner Lambert that the people will make a good decision on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| We trust the people as well, which is why we're undertaking this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| To the extent that they can have a very clear question before them on each of the nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| then we think that is the purest form of democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| They can vote yes or they can vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| And this legislative body can vote yes to the current proposal that is an amended one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:59| or they can vote it down and then vote for the pure one as you've presented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| You have put this in the hands of a legislative body, sir, and this legislative body is going to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| You can still take it to the petitions if you choose to, but as long as I sit on this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| I'm going to try any time I see something that I think could be fixed, could be tweaked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| I'm going to do that through the amendment process because that's what legislators do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| I respectfully disagree with Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| I think we need to stay with the proposals as this group has presented them to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7718)|
| 2:08:44| and I think we need to vote and vote quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| Oh, your light's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| I'd like to ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| I read an article in the paper, I believe, and you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| have you all raised any money to promote this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| We just started last week to underwrite the petition drive and probably seven days ago the effort started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| So we will be doing that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| I was thinking I read something in the paper where John Smith said y'all had already raised $130,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:19| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| John can respond if he's here and he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| My comments were that we had gotten some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| John Smith, 1636 Lines Bend Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| My comments were we had committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| People had pledged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| They had not given any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| The process Mr. Parnell is talking about is when people's checks have started coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| What was this money to be used for, this pledge money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| Was it to promote this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| To get the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| I believe that's what I understood you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| You said you needed probably another $150,000, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| At the time, that's what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| To get these petitions, these two questions on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| That's just to get them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| Now, that's not promoting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| Yeah, that's just to get the petition process to put them on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| It would take I don't know how much to run an informative campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| Well, you know, what I'm concerned about is if you're raising money to promote this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| where's the money coming from the citizens that are against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| You know, I'd like to know when you're raising this money who it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| Well, they'll be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| We have to disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| You know, we pulled this pack on this $4,500, you know, this trust government or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| And it really amazed me that the people that contributed to that were the powers to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| I didn't see little everyday working people out here giving that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| We will be totally transparent and disclose everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| And we point people to our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| They can give the website using PayPal, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| And we'll be totally transparent and disclose every penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| and who gave every penny, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| And I appreciate your comments, Mr. Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| even though you didn't agree with some of these proposals that you thought the people should vote for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| I just wish you'd extend that same logic to the partisan, nonpartisan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| and the school board commission district lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| You know, they're kind of illogical going against each other there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| And is there any other questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Yeah, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| Could you just, the nonpartisan, does that only apply to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| or does it apply to the sheriff, the mayor, or any other positions, the clerks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| I think in this instance it's only the commission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| So the mayor would still be partisan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| So you could have a Democrat or Republican mayor, but you'd have a nonpartisan commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| That's what is contemplated, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| I will say that I agree with Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| We all know how we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| Let's take them, vote them up, vote them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| We're going to debate each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| We're going to debate each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| I would remind you too, pardon me, Mr. Chairman, this is only on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| We've got to do this all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| So after we have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| So this is round one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Mr. Hammond, will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| We have a substitute motion on the floor and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Could you state it again for Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| Yeah, this is 102 as it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| except we've removed the language that goes to nonpartisan primaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| and we've removed the language that aligns the school board and the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7958)|
| 2:12:46| We all understand the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| I think it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| Who was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=7976)|

| 2:14:48| Take two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8088)|

| 2:15:03| I can't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| Voted 13 ayes, six noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| So the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| And it does take 13 votes because it takes a two-thirds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| It takes two-thirds for these to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| And it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| And this is on first reading, so we get a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| First readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| One on three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| Two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| This is amending Article 9, excuse me, Article 9 of the Knox County Charter to adopt conflicts of interest policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8131)|

| 2:16:09| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| How are these different from the policies that we've just recently changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:22| Or are they the same and we're just placing it within the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| It's the same as the ethics policy we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| So the language is already in our ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| So we're just mirroring the ethics policy that we've already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| We're just placing it in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| I understand that the wording is basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:42| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| Well, I'm just waiting for an answer from the law director to see if there's, I mean, if there's differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| or is it exactly the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| I didn't know you'd call on the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| You're at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| Wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| It is virtually the same as in the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| It changes the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| Its section, actually, we've renumbered the sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| It's 9.08C, which provides, and let me just read it right quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| It will repeal this section and create this new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| Any member of the commission who is also an employee of the county may vote on matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| in which he has a conflict of interest arising from his or her employment with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| If the member informs the commission immediately prior to the vote as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| And then there's the litany that you go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| Because I'm an employee of the county, I have a conflict of interest, and so on and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8259)|
| 2:17:45| that we've gone through a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| And so what this allows you to do is to basically, if you're going to cast a vote on the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| you have to disclose your personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| Well, I guess now that brings the question that since that language is in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| and I am an employee of the Knox County Trustee's Office, should I recuse myself voting on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8285)|
| 2:18:17| No, you can just read the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8297)|
| 2:18:23| You know, I'm just trying to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| Are you asking the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:27| I'm asking the law director if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| By rewriting the section, basically by approving this ordinance, this amendment to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| you're rewriting the section, section C, which deals specifically with whether an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:46| who's also a member of the commission, may vote on a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| It may be a perfect matter for you to read your, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| So I should either read the statement or recuse myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| I'll recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| Commissioner, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8343)|

| 2:19:16| And the one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| One oh four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| Ordinance one oh four is amending article nine of the Knox County Charter to repeal enactments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| inconsistent with the adoption of charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| Knox County Charter has adopted 11888 as amended through referendum of 8604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8372)|

| 2:19:49| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Can I get a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| Just a general question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| I don't know who it's even directed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| But is there a vetting process or do we always take the new ordinance when there's a conflict between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:16| existing charter and the new one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| Is there a process that we go through to try to get the intent of the original change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| or do we just automatically ratify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| Mr. Parnell, could you also explain what this is all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| Our resident attorney, Mr. McAdams, perhaps to address the issue that Commissioner McKenzie is raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:45| I think we need to get Mr. Adams to stay down here at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8445)|
| 2:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| The intention of this provision was to make it clear what rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| what provision controls in the event that there is a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| And the basically the charter trumps everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| So when these charter amendments and any future charter amendments that might be adopted are the ones that control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:23| over any code references to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| One of the things that would be very cumbersome would be to go in and list, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| this amends these 20 sections of the Knox County Code or something in the body of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8491)|
| 2:21:38| So you just say this one, a charter amendment, is going to automatically repeal anything that is to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| Now, if it relates to it, it doesn't repeal it unless it directly conflicts with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| So the way this one works is if when you adopt the amendment there are things that conflict with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| then they are automatically repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8515)|
| 2:21:58| And anything that are enacted subsequent to it that conflict with it are void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| You have to go back and amend this section in order to be able to adopt something that was in conflict with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:09| So basically it's just a rule of interpretation that's intended to help in the future of deciding what controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8529)|
| 2:22:17| and the answer is the charter controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| And it repeals anything that might be adopted to the contrary in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| That's if some future commission was unaware of a provision and adopted an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| then that ordinance would be void if it was in conflict with the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| I have an observation, you know, for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| You can help me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| This is an observation that I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| I can foresee this going out and held in these public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| And this group getting out here and they're going to say, say we're going to change this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| And if we don't have our law department here to defend us, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| Commissioner Luthold has already hit several items, one right after the other, that, guys, we've already got this in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| I mean, I foresee these people come and say, you know, we've got a bunch of idiots up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| and we're going to change everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| And if we don't have anybody to defend us from the law department saying, you know, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| some of these things are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| You know, John, I don't know if that's possible for your people, you, or, I mean, I don't want to put everything on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| but we need to have representation to clarify some of this stuff with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| Otherwise, it's going to be a one-sided show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| First of all, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| I don't know what you mean when you state that the law director says that we already have these items in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| We're talking about, you know, how many commissioners that we can appoint or how many we can have on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| You have the charter as it reads now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| and you have the amendments that have been proposed through the Knox County One Question Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| They seek to change all of these provisions in the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| And I think we need somebody from our side or from Knox County here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| I've been, you know, I've been in office a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| I've been in the law director's office 17 and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| I don't know how many of these meetings that I've missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| I'll continue to be here through August 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| I'm talking, John, I'm talking about when they go out to the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| When they go out to the districts and they hold these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| we need representation from the law department to say, to give our side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:30| If they come out to halls and they do this and they're going to read all these off, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8670)|
| 2:24:36| I am not up on the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| Maybe I should be, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| That's where I depend on the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| And I just want the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| I've been to halls once or twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| Well, I just want, I mean, I guess what I want from you, a commitment from your department that we would have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:54| representation at these nine meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| And I know you'll be at these public forums here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| You see what I'm getting at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| We're committed to conducting all the legal affairs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| If you would like for us to be at these meetings, we'll make sure that we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| These meetings, these nine meetings in the districts, we'll make sure that there's someone there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8712)|
| 2:25:19| whether it be me or someone from my office there, who can answer the public's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8719)|
| 2:25:25| You, sir, should be familiar with all these changes yourself since you're voting on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| That's all I wanted from you is just that you or some of your people would be there to help us with some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| I agree with what you say, Commissioner Smith, especially this particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| It appears to be a shortcut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| Instead of listing what the changes are going to be, we're just going to simply say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| whatever's there is now void if it conflicts with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| And maybe, you know, and what some of those items may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| it may take an attorney with a fine-tooth comb to go through and figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8766)|
| 2:26:12| What are the ultimate changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| But I do have the concerns that Commissioner Smith also states is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| who is going to say, gosh, there may be something wrong with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| And no offense to their attorney, but he is their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:35| He's not the county's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| He's not even the state's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| We don't even, you know, some of these things we might even need to ask the state attorney general how he feels about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| Now, we all know what, how much an opinion of attorney is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| They can get overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| So I just, like I said to begin with, there's a lot of legal questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| and a lot of conflicts going back and forth that I wanted answers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| but I guess I'm just not going to get them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:07| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| And that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| That's what I've been saying all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| I don't believe there's many of us know exactly what you're voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| And that's why I said, what's the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| Let's have public forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Let's understand what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| Let's understand the consequences of what we're doing before we send it out to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| Because we're here, we're playing this every single day out in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| We're trying to stay informed as much as possible because we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| Just think of the moms and dads that's taking their kids to school, going home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| getting them to take them to football practice, baseball practice, soccer practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| They ain't going to have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| And here we are throwing this stuff out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| And everybody, the paper's going to say how great it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| And there's nobody going to know or be able to tell them what they're really voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| And that's why I said we need to educate ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| So, as I've done so far, except for one, I'm going to continue to vote no tonight on every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| Not because I'm against them, because we don't understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| You know, we sit here and debate a boat dry storage for three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| And we're passing all these in just a matter of a couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| And changing our basically our constitution of this whole county after 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:34| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8914)|
| 2:28:43| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| Four the noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8935)|
| 2:29:07| I think we ought to have a roll call vote, really, so this can be recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| It probably would be the smart thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| We have a roll call vote for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| Start in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt2?start=8954)|
