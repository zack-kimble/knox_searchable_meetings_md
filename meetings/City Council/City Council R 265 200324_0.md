| 0:08:25| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=505)|

| 0:08:30| Somehow you're highlighted in my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Raise your hand if you want to postpone something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| No more items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Let's move on to items requested to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| I had a council attorney email everyone a emergency ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| This is an emergency ordinance that removes the food requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| allowing businesses with on-off premise permits to deliver beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| while the governor's executive order is in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Our restaurant and bar community, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| have been uniquely impacted by COVID-19 outbreak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| This ordinance will provide additional flexibility for those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| to remain open and continue to keep their workers employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| So I make a motion that we add that by emergency on our agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=560)|
| 0:09:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| OK, motion made by Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| seconded by Councilman Smith and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| I guess this is just added and we can discuss it once we get to it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Yes, just procedurally, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| just procedurally for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| anything that's being added by emergency has to be unanimously added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| So I hope all of you would at least bring this up so we can have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| You're now voting on whether to add this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| You're not voting on the merits of it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| just on whether to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| And it requires all nine of you to approve it in order to have it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Like Councilman Roberto said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Is that everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Okay, pass unanimously so it'll be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=641)|
| 0:10:53| What will the number be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| It'll be 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Okay, 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Okay, are there other items that Council members wish to add to the agenda? Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=663)|
| 0:11:13| I am. Thank you, Mayor. I have a resolution that I would like to add to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| and everyone should have received it by email. This was something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| hopefully, thankfully Rob helped me develop the language around, and it's entitled the COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=687)|
| 0:11:37| funding response, and what I hope is just an initial response that sends a message to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| community that we support as a City Council the work that the Mayor and the Administration are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| doing to coordinate social services, and this sends a stronger message that while we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| engaged in that coordination, while we are waiting for updates from the Federal Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| we are doing all that we can on a local level to put emergency funds in place to support these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| agencies who are on the front lines and are already experiencing, you know, financial hardships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=733)|
| 0:12:23| already have concerns and fears and lots of fears in our community about how they're going to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| the next bill, and so I'm not proposing that we take on the responsibility of making sure everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| can pay those bills, but that we do all that we can in the areas where we are already providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| support, the term of that support in this moment. Okay, a motion is made to add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| item on the COVID-19 funding response. Seconded by Mr. Smith. Any further discussion? And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=769)|
| 0:13:01| this takes a unanimous vote just to add it to the agenda for discussion. It can be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| when we get to it in the agenda. Any further discussion before we vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| Okay, Mr. Johnson, would you conduct a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Okay, the motion to add the emergency resolution passes. Is that going to be 12b?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=823)|
| 0:13:51| It's going to be 11n.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=831)|
| 0:14:03| Any other items of council members would you add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| Okay, seeing none, we'll move on to consent items 11i to 11j.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| Okay, do I have to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| Certificates of compliance and then 11k to 11m pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| I'd like to add a motion. I'd like to add to that, amend it. I would like to add on items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=873)|
| 0:14:41| 8a through 8e for consent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=881)|
| 0:14:51| Those are items under elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| Okay, first the motion was made to approve consent by I think Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| and then it was second. I mean, do you guys want to have all these things on consent? It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I mean, it's fine with me. I just want to make sure I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Let's first add the items to consent and then the amendment of Ms. Singh's amendment. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| I guess, is that? Yes, that's correct. What you should do first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| What you see printed or on your computers is regular consent items 11i to 11j. Certificates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| of compliance 11k through 11m pensions. Motion was made to approve that on consent by Ms. Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| and I think it was seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie. And then we'll vote on that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=943)|
| 0:15:53| then we can vote to add to the consent. No, now you move to amend it. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Okay, now it's made by Ms. Singh to add the elections and confirmations eight items 8a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| through 8e to the consent agenda. Is there a second to that amendment? Second. I heard Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Roberto first, so the amendment was made by Ms. Singh and seconded by Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| Any discussion about this amendment of adding items 8a through 8e. These are elections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| confirmations. Any further discussion on that before we vote on whether to add that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| consent? Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=990)|
| 0:16:39| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1008)|
| 0:17:03| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| Okay, that amendment was passed unanimously. Now we're voting on whether on the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| itself. Mr. Johnson, please can write that correct? Correct. Okay, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| conduct a roll call vote on the consent agenda as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1074)|
| 0:18:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Pardon. Okay, so the consent agenda was approved unanimously. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1087)|
| 0:18:16| Yes, ma'am. Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| Mayor's report. Okay, can everybody hear me okay? Yes. Yes. First, I just want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1103)|
| 0:18:35| council and the recorder's office and CTV and the public for putting community safety first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| and arranging this electronic meeting. It's definitely not ideal, but we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| be able to conduct a public forum in the normal manner. Hopefully, if people have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| they share them with council members by email or send them to the recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| So, I know this is suboptimal, but it's a good faith effort to balance the need for transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| for getting the city's business conducted and to practice social distancing in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| of the pandemic. So, it's also a newly revised open meeting fact that Governor Bill Lee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1153)|
| 0:19:24| executive order number 16 tacked or issued last week about the COVID-19 threat, which allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1164)|
| 0:19:34| us to do this. A week ago, we were not allowed to do this, but now we can because of the COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| threat. As the weeks, you know, two weeks from now, we'll have to revisit it and see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1180)|
| 0:19:48| I imagine that we'll be conducting at least a few more meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| city council meetings in this manner, and we'll get more refined and better at it as we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| Let's see, any members of the public who have questions or comments about specific agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| going forward, you can contact the city recorder's office before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| and the input will be forwarded to all council members. And that number is 865-215-2075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| And just so you know, this is being recorded and will be posted to the city website and also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| I guess, streamed to the CTV site. So, people will be able to watch and hear everything we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| just not exactly while we're doing it. Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Yeah. But it's the recording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| just going to be my face here in the center. Before we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| Well, I'm looking at like the whole grid of people. I don't know which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| you CTV is looking at. I imagine it would be the whole grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Okay, let's hope. Sorry, please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| But I've never looked at a Zoom recording before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| I'm sorry, CTV confirmed that it would be the gallery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Okay. Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| The next thing I wanted to talk about, and I sent you guys an email just about an hour ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| an hour or so before the meeting started. So, I know it was not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| you may not have had time to read it, but I wanted to share with you what the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| response to COVID-19 has been over the last 2 weeks. First, I mean, I just want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| all the people who work for the city of Knoxville for all their huge amount of work that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| happening the last 2 weeks across the board, all departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| It's been a really fast moving situation that changes daily and requires community attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| It requires a lot of attention into our own employees. We've been working with elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| leaders, emergency response professionals, health experts, community of faith leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| really quickly and in a very high stress environment that requires a lot of coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| So, one of the first things we did was the work with the health department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| activate the emergency operations center that was mobilized last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| And the main focus is coordinating social service providers to ensure that the short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| and long-term needs of the community are being met. So, there's something like 104 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| groups coordinating together on needs for children, on needs for senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| on needs for homeless, on needs for people who have lost their incomes and are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| struggling to pay their bills. All of these entities are working through the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| operations center and different community entities are really taking, you know, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| taking the lead depending on what their expertise is. If their expertise is in food, we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| food group. If we've got expertise on senior citizens, we have help with that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| transportation. Of course, the school system has now been operating with food distributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| and schools are going to be closed for at least the next two weeks, probably longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| And that's been operating pretty smoothly from what I hear. So, there's groups helping youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| seniors, homeless, immigrant refugee services. And we're also working a lot to consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1406)|
| 0:23:35| information because there's a lot of information coming in and a lot of people working. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| sometimes people don't know what work is happening. So, they're like, well, what are you doing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| how are we going to help with the homeless? How are we going to help our senior citizens who can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| go to the grocery store? And people are working on that and things are already in place or being put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| in place. But one of the things the city's helping with is trying to consolidate that information and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| then share it out in a way that people can understand and digest. Let's see. So, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1439)|
| 0:24:09| to everyone who's been putting in really long hours, working weekends. This meeting is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| example of our information services team. A week ago, nobody was telecommuting. And now we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1454)|
| 0:24:24| I think something like most everybody who can be working from home is and has the computers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1464)|
| 0:24:33| systems access so they can continue working and doing the business of the city from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Of course, city employees cannot work from home and we're making accommodations for them to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| safe as well. Next, I'm just going to talk about the health department's safer at home order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| but does anyone have any questions about, I mean, we're going to talk about item 11M and stuff when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| we get to that later, but does anyone have any questions right now about what I was just saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| Okay. I'd like to just say something, add something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| Oh, just, I know that United Way has collected together a large emergency fund and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| continuing and they're going to distribute that within the next few days, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| And then they're gathering more money to keep supporting all of those agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| that are picking up everything that needs to be picked up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Yeah, United Way is really stepping up. Also, I mean, there's special funds available for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| in the arts community who've lost their sources of income. There's a grace fund that the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| Cultural and Arts Alliance has put together. There's a fund for bartenders and restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| workers. And all of this stuff is on the city of Knoxville website, links to it, because a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| people turn to the city for help and we want to provide that help. And some of the way we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| that help is directing them to the people in the community who are doing that with their expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| and their resources. So United Way has been really fantastic at coordinating that and also has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| money raised. Mr. Thomas? Yes. I wanted to thank you, Mayor, for all the effort that you've put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1580)|
| 0:26:29| on this. My question would be, I guess, just generally, my concern is the supplies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| when the need increases, which we're afraid it's going to, how well stocked are hospitals right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| now with gloves, masks, protective equipment for the hospital workers? Well, that's an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| and personal protective equipment. PPE is the acronym is a huge issue, not just for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| healthcare workers, first and foremost, but also for our first responders. So I've appointed Chip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| Berry to be the city's liaison for COVID-19 issues. And he is working with CHEMA. The Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1630)|
| 0:27:20| Emergency Management Agency is overseeing the EOC, Emergency Operations Center. And one of their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| in addition to social services, they are the coordinating entity to collect PPE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| and then send it to the National Guard. And it's being coordinated through the hospitals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| sharing information about what they have and what they need. Governor Lee issued an executive order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| either yesterday or today that said no more elective procedures, dentists or hospitals or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| any kind of medical things. And what that means is that those entities can share their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| medical protective gear with the acute need hospitals that are going to be dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| with COVID coronavirus patients. So everyone recognizes this as a huge need nationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1689)|
| 0:28:18| and here in Tennessee and here in Knoxville. And I think with the hospital, I had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| meet with the leaders of our large hospitals and they say they have enough for now, but they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| that they're going to need more and actively collecting that. And I know a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| in the community want to help. And some people are like hand sewing things and that's great for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| certain circumstances and certainly better than nothing, but we want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| the specific mask, the kinds of stuff that will really protect them from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| people who are dealing directly with patients suffering from the virus, the N95 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| whatever the medically appropriate protective gear is. That's what we want because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| we can't have our healthcare workers getting sick because then we're really in trouble. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| this is all something that the state is working on, the hospitals are working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| and Chip Baird is helping from a city's perspective. Also Chief Sharp and Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| have said that, again, they have enough personal protective equipment for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| teams at the moment. And I know Chad Weth has been collecting gear for the public service people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| are working, interacting with the public. So everyone sort of has enough for now, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| busily trying to assemble and collect more because they know they're going to need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| And we're working on all avenues to do that. And it's a big need everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| And as far as ventilators and stuff, our hospitals have some. And if we are fortunate and have acted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1793)|
| 0:30:03| in an expeditious manner to do this safer at home stuff and practice social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| then that's supposed to flatten the curve and then we'll be more likely to not run out of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| supplies and equipment to deal with this. But everyone knows we need more and everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| working to get more. Is Chip Baird listening in? Do you have anything to add to that, Chip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1822)|
| 0:30:31| I don't know if he's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Okay, well, he might not be on. If anyone from staff has something to add beyond what I just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| let me know. But that's where we are. I think Mr. Thomas, like, yeah, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| I just wanted to say, I know the medical community is really working hard to organize their workflows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| and to organize their staffing as well. They, like you've said, anything that's unnecessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1855)|
| 0:31:04| scripts that can be filled over the phone and done through phone consults rather than bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| people in and put them at risk have all been taken care of at the various doctor's offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| and clinics. But they are working on changing their staffing schedules and moving people around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| to open up beds and get people organized to free up space as is needed. So what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| from the medical community is that they are organizing themselves and preparing for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| as best they can. So there's a lot of hard work going on to be able to address things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| as they arise and get potentially any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| Well, so just going forward, the EOC is sort of coordinating that, KEMA, and CHIP is the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| liaison on all things COVID-19. Obviously, we're all working on this together, but that in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| getting that equipment out to the healthcare workers and to our first responders is a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| a big coordination effort. And I encourage everybody to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| CHIP and then, you know, CHIP is going to be funneling those things through the EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| Yeah, I have no doubt that locally we're trying to do as much as we can with what we have. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| I'm like a lot of people are frustrated that there's actually a shortage of material, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| of these things, supplies that we actually need on the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| But I applaud, you know, all the health workers and hospitals in Knoxville for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| making do with what they have now. And I really hope that there's more on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| Me too, me too. I want to next cover the topic of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| a safer at home. As you know, you know, I declared a state of emergency last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| and then on Friday, issued an executive order to have restaurants and bars go to carry out only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| and to close down gyms and commercial venues, many of which had already closed. And the main reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| as I mentioned, and I think I spoke to all of you, or left personal messages was to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| really encourage social distancing, especially as people and families in this area returned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| from spring break travels, because a lot of people travel to places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| where coronavirus might be already more widespread. And so getting that done before the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| weekend, I mean, for the weekend, seems really important. Two days later, Governor Lee issued a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| similar executive order that was good for the whole state. And now we're all in alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| and then on Monday, Dr. Buchanan with the health department issued a countywide order for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| Knox County called safer at home. And this is, you know, an unprecedented thing, but it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2042)|
| 0:34:11| so is a pandemic. And so what it does is, as you guys know, it encourages everyone to stay at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| unless you, you know, except only leave your home for essential things like if you're going to a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| that isn't considered an essential function, or run to the grocery store, you know, going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| pharmacy, that sort of thing. People are still encouraged and welcome to go out for walks and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| and be outside, you know, gardening, you know, strolling, exercising, but during these times to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| practice the six feet of social distancing, like it's not a time to play, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| basketball with a big group of people because, you know, everyone who touches that ball, if one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| person has the virus, it's highly infectious. And so, so I want to, you know, I was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| thankful that the health department took that very difficult step. As I said, during the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| conference about that Dr. Buchanan, you know, explained it, and then the hospital leaders were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| there, and then they asked the mayors to speak. And in my comment at the time, and I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| repeat it here, is that these are unprecedented times, and we are having to make really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| choices between people's livelihoods and people's lives. And I'm, obviously lives are, if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| have a life, then the livelihood doesn't matter. And I've been very convinced by the public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| leaders and the health department leaders who say that if we follow these safer at home practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| really, and adhere to them very closely, not only will it save lives, it will mitigate the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| fallout of it because it, you know, it means that people can get back to normal sooner if we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| this. So that's, that's the hope. It's, it closes down all non-essential businesses. There's lists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| on our website and on the health department website. It's an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| So people understandably, they have a lot of anxiety about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Most people, many people that I've heard from have said, you know, just, you know, confirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| what they've already been practicing. Other people, it's new and they're getting used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| So I'm, I'm encouraged. Most people seem to be complying with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Let's see, the order is for now remains in effect until April 6th, 2020. It's a two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| of duration. We'll see what happens at that time. As you know, on Sunday, we had five confirmed cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| of coronavirus in Knox County. Yesterday it was 12. Today it's up to 15. There's a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| a bit of lag there, you know, I'm sure you all have been following it. There's been a lag in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| testing and not everyone who has been able to. So I think that we'll have more information. And now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2218)|
| 0:37:09| the health department is giving daily briefings and there, and there seems to be a statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| effort to have more transparency and more frequent updates on the testing stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| I've heard as you have too, all kinds of, you know, rumors, we're going to have drive-thru testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| and we're not having drive-thru testing, all this stuff. Like as soon as I have heard any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| information, we'll share it out about, about those things, you know, based on what the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| department shares with us. So I don't have any other information on testing. I know that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| big issue that everyone, I actually had a conversation with the governor today with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| other big city mayors and said transparency on testing and on results and on the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2266)|
| 0:37:55| the equipment is essential, even if the news is not so good, even if we think we got an X number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| of ventilators or tests, we have a lot fewer than that. We still need to tell the public that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| because that transparency builds confidence and trust. And we have to have that to make our way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| through that. He certainly agreed and seems to be making some progress on that. Schools are closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| but daycare and childcare businesses will remain open and childcare has been asked to, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| already seen them act on this, to prioritize taking care of children of people in the healthcare and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| first responders. So they're doing that. And obviously, because you can still go, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2315)|
| 0:38:43| the grocery stores, pharmacies, all those sorts of things are still open. Banks are open. Gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| stations are open. Restaurants and bars are carry out only. Our camp buses are running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| We, to protect the operators, we have encouraged everybody to use cat for essential trips only. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| know it is the only form of transportation for many Knoxville residents. So we're going to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| cat up and running. And we're not asking people to pay so they can enter at the back and stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| the, you know, so practice social distancing from the driver and from other passengers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| The parkways are open, but there's no organized sports. And then we want people to use the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| in passive ways where you can also stay six feet apart. Ms. Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2366)|
| 0:39:34| Well, just, you may be able to clarify this question that's come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| about the new cat policy because it's been shared as a temporary policy. Do we know if that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2382)|
| 0:39:51| is kind of lining up with our own shelter in place timeline or is their policy on a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| timeline? We want to align it with the health department directives until, unless we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| other information. I mean, I don't want to make it last longer than that. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2404)|
| 0:40:12| but yeah, I mean, I don't know if there is a timeframe associated with that, except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| that it would be consistent with the health needs. Like we're not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| we're going to keep that going as long as the health needs require it. Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| I mean, nobody really knows what that means yet. Okay. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2425)|
| 0:40:38| Another thing you probably know that Governor Lee also issued an executive order limiting visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| to nursing homes, right? Retirement homes, assisted living facilities. And that's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| elderly people are the most at risk of severe acute cases of COVID-19. So that's been, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2453)|
| 0:41:04| is a challenge. And I know that people can accept deliveries of things, but you can't go in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| to visit your family members in nursing homes. So that's a big challenge. Let's see. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2470)|
| 0:41:20| encouraging anyone who has questions about health issues to call their own doctor, if they have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| and also to call the Knox County Health Department for health questions. And their number is 215-5555.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| For people who have questions about other things associated with the changes with the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| we encourage people to go to the city of Knoxville website, knoxvilletn.gov. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| our communications team has been updating it frequently. We have great infographics that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| explain and easy to read charts, like what social distancing means and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| It also has frequently asked questions. It has a chat bot. The 311 team, Russ Jensen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| has created a chat bot to help answer questions about census 2020. And that is still available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| but then they were able to add that tool to answer questions about COVID-19. So the nice thing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| the chat bot is some people, if there's a long wait for someone to answer the phone, or if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| doing it after hours, they can still get their questions answered if they have access to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| computer and the internet through the chat bot. And the city website also has information about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| United Way. It has information for people having financial issues, they've lost their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| or need help with bills, or maybe they are a small business owner and they're worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| making their rent and has connections to resources for all the people who are struggling in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| face of the changes that are happening. So there's also a list of what's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| essential business and what isn't. So basically essential businesses are government services and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2588)|
| 0:43:18| our first responders and healthcare workers. You all probably read the list. I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| repeat it here, but if you need to go look at it more, it's all on our city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| The Chamber of Commerce, which we also link to, has great resources for business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and also some information for people who want to file for unemployment benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| I just licked my finger. Sorry. Don't touch your face and wash your hands a lot. I have washed my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2619)|
| 0:43:47| hands a lot. 211 is a great number to call and a great resource for people who have questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| food insecurity, employment, and other issues. One thing we offered to help the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| they are very, very busy dealing with the health-related questions. So we said we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| take questions regarding the financial and business implications. So we're directing calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| to 311 and 211 for those. For the people who are not at risk and who want to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| Volunteer East Tennessee is directing people to volunteer opportunities. And they're obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2661)|
| 0:44:30| depending on the nature of the activity, screening people to make sure that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| are not sick. And you can read more at VolunteerEastTennessee.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2674)|
| 0:44:43| Yeah. And last, this has been a very hectic and stressful time for everyone in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| and I really appreciate everyone on council's willingness and eagerness to help out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| everyone in the city for working so hard. It's going to be a marathon. It's been a rough two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| weeks, but I feel like we're in the process of getting systems in place to help our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2702)|
| 0:45:11| practice the Safer at Home, follow the Safer at Home strategies while also just maintaining their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| mental and physical health and being able to maintain their financial needs too. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| it's a work in progress, but everyone is stepping up. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| that concludes my mayor's remarks. If anyone has any questions before we move to the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| agenda. I did have a question. I was able to learn a little bit, getting updates from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2734)|
| 0:45:45| administration today about, am I frozen? No. The work being done and the discussions taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2745)|
| 0:45:55| within the emergency operations center and the different work groups. And one thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| trying to determine what the city can do to help our homeless community with their attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2762)|
| 0:46:13| to social isolation and needing space to do that. Is there anything you can share with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| in this meeting? Yeah, I know that there's an entire group dedicated to sorting that and working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| Mike Dunthorne is involved in that and trying to help out from a city perspective. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| COPS came to the EOC and saying they wanted to make sure that the people who work for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| their staff and their volunteers had personal protective equipment so they could continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| working and feeling safe. And I know there's a lot of discussion about sheltering and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| sort of thing. I don't think there are any final decisions that have been made, but I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| discussions are happening. What I can do is, let's see, I'll ask Erin Gill, Deputy Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2821)|
| 0:47:11| to speak to this a little bit. Go ahead, Erin. Hi, everyone. Sorry, hopefully you can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| Councilwoman Parker, that's exactly right, what the mayor said. One of the things that CARM is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| immediately implementing and has been doing for several days now, I think since Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| is they're moving their dining services outside to enable folks to be a little bit more spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| out during meal time. So, in addition to some of the strategies that you and I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| earlier around screening and making sure that the folks coming into the kind of what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| the big three homeless agencies that operate near Broadway, in addition to screening folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| and having the space for people to spread out while they're coming into those facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| they're also looking at how they can spread people out while they're in the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| themselves. Just to provide that additional social distancing, even for folks who maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| weren't exhibiting symptoms, keep that extra layer of protection during meals and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| during the recreation time. Thank you, Ms. Gill. Ms. Parker, did you, I mean, I think it's a work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2886)|
| 0:48:16| in progress. Everyone's very concerned and I think everyone's also coming together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| protect our neighbors who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| And we'll keep you posted as things unfold. I mean, there's just no final answers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| No, thank you for that. Thank you for that update. I had a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| If we could just address for the public, I've had a couple today and earlier a question about using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| outdoor recreation areas like our parks, areas like that. And I think some people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| that it's the activities, organized groups and activities that are no longer, that are canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2932)|
| 0:49:00| But is there any signage in parks, in any areas where there would be children or anything to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| of educate the public about maintaining distancing? Because maybe some aren't aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| Yeah, we need to, we're in the process of putting signs up. This order just came out yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2953)|
| 0:49:22| We just haven't had a chance to do it. I know. We totally agree. Like, you know, people don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| always know it's closed. And then if they come and the doors are locked, they don't know why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| it's closed or they're upset about it. Some of our rec centers are going to remain open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| service sites for food distribution for children who are out of school. And there may be other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| uses for the rec center for like basically emergency child care and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| But they're closed to all programming. And if we are doing things that serve kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| we're going to be obviously very, very carefully following the health department guidelines for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| how to do that safely. It's a really big challenge because, you know, if you're a nurse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| or doctor or firefighter or police officer and you have to go to work and you have kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| you need a safe place to keep them. And you may not want to bring them over to Grandma's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| because she's high risk or whatever. So we're trying to strike that balance and work with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| community partners, the Boys and Girls Club, MLQs and that sort of thing. But I guess I'm getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| off your original questions. Yes, we're putting signs up. I'm not sure how long that will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| David Grace, do you have an answer to maybe how long when those signs might be going up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| Yeah. Chin Berry is working with Cheryl Ely on language for those signs. And we want it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| consistent with the language that perhaps Emerald Youth may have on their fields with the Boys and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| Girls Club. So we've got to get the language right and we've got to get the signs, those kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| vinyl push signs that we can put out throughout our park. So I don't have an exact time schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| but I'm going to text Cheryl here during council and I'll get an email out to council members with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| an estimated time schedule. Does that sound good? Okay. So just to clarify, we're not discouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| people from being outdoors and getting exercise or fresh air. We're just discouraging groupings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| of activities. Well, also to get close together and everything, but not like a group of 10 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3078)|
| 0:51:27| You know, it's not a snow day. It's where you can all like do things in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| This is what the health department says, like practice social distancing, even if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| outside. So you can go biking, but you can go walking, but keep that six feet or more distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| I also wanted to clarify though, is there a concern about our ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3103)|
| 0:51:51| keep playground equipment clean? Was there going to be some decision around playground equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| That's been a topic of discussion. David, do you have some, can you, you know, we, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| Well, yeah, I think what we were discussing was that playground equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| playground equipment, kids and that equipment is, it could be a source. So if you had multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3129)|
| 0:52:16| kids playing throughout the day, it could be a source. So I think open fields, walking pathways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| greenways, you know, if there was a single person on a basketball court, I mean, you know, tennis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| if you played single. So we're working through what is appropriate. I think we were leaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| towards play sets not being open just because of what could happen with multiple kids throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| the day. So the signage is going to be something like, you know, park open for passive play. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| know, if it's a soccer field or a multi-use field, it may say open for passive individual player,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| small group play, no competitive. So we want to keep it simple and we're working on that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| with our other partners and we'll get that deployed. But I think play sets would be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Thank you, David. Ms. Parker, does anyone have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3181)|
| 0:53:14| Okay. As you can see, you know, things are moving really quickly and we're responding as fast as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| can and trying to follow all the best practices to stop the spread and flatten the curve and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3200)|
| 0:53:28| those things. It's complicated, but I think we've made incredible progress as a city and as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| community. And I really do think that, you know, we have the benefit of a head start. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3216)|
| 0:53:44| advanced warning from other parts of the country and other parts of the world where if we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| action now and do a good job of it, we're not going to be hit as hard. And one thing that might happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| is we do a really good job of doing the safer at home practices and then not that many people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| sick and that's a win. And people will say, well, you overreacted. I'll say, no, we overreacted just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| the right amount and prevented a lot of deaths and tragedies. So the best possible outcome is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| we adhere to the safer at home order and not that many people get sick and our hospitals can treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| them and then this, you know, dies down and we can go back to normal in the future at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3260)|
| 0:54:28| So that's my sincere hope and I'm hoping that the community will work with us. I know we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| I'm really, I know we can do it. I'm grateful for all the people in the city who are working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| That concludes my mayor's report. Do you have any reports from council members or committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| Vice Mayor McKenzie. Okay, thank you, Mayor. I just basically want to piggyback off of some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3291)|
| 0:54:59| information that you shared. I just want to thank all the agencies and also all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| city and county partners for the diligence and the work that's been put into coming up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| all of the actions that we have in place now in order to try to keep our residents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| our community safe and mitigate community spread, which I think in the grand scheme of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| we've taken all the right steps and actions to this point. I also want to ask you, I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3326)|
| 0:55:34| you referenced 311 and 211 for people to be able to call and find out about different resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| I do know that there are churches and some additional agencies that are in the community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| are doing a food collection, they're doing grocery giveaways, they're doing meal giveaways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| such as OBC Church, and I do want to thank them as well as a school board member, Ebby Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| who connected Yasim and also Yasim from Yasim's Popple House for donating hot meals to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| community via OBC as well. And so I want to ask you, Mayor, could some of these resources also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3368)|
| 0:56:16| maybe register themselves with 311 or 211 so when people call from different parts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| they can find out what is available that may be in walking distance to them, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| That's a great idea. If you could either share that information with Russ Jensen and his team or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| encourage the various churches that are doing that to share that, and then his team of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| answering the calls will have that information in their system to call on and say, oh you live two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| blocks from this food pantry or whatever, or there's this church that will bring food right to your door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| Okay, absolutely. And so I know that other council members in your communities and your districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| that you serve know about other resources as well, so maybe if we all can encourage them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| contact Russ or just 311 or maybe give you the information and then we can pull it together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| just make a power list to give to Russ to share for resources. I just think that that's so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| better because a lot of times... You can do it as you find out, and he'll just put it into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| You don't have to like collect 30 things and then give it all at once. Just say, you know, pass it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| into him as you come across it. Okay, great. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Again, as I said, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3448)|
| 0:57:36| that we're doing... We're taking all the appropriate steps right now, and I definitely appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| and Mayor Jacobs and Dr. Buchanan for your diligence. I know it's... And deputies, everyone, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| council members, because I know all of us have been getting a lot of questions, building calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| and actually going out helping people as well with food and checking on seniors. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| I just want to commend the work that's been done at this point. I want to thank council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| your patience as we are going through these motions of social distancing ourselves, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| at the end of the day, we need to stay healthy because there are a lot of major decisions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| we have to make, and I'm sure that we will make before we're out of this crisis. And so again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| just wanted to thank everyone for the work and the efforts that have been put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| to this point. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. If you don't mind, I have two other things I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| wanted to mention that I forgot to mention. First, this is Jim Hageman's last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| Jim, I see you down at the bottom there. If you're listening, you can show us your face if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| you want, but he's been a director of engineering for eight plus years now. And we really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3525)|
| 0:58:56| all the work that you've done. Engineering does a lot of work to keep the city running and protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| our infrastructure and build and stand and be sustainable. So just want to thank Mr. Hageman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3544)|
| 0:59:13| for all your work. And we had a party reception planned, but of course, we'll have to reschedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| that when we're allowed to meet in group gatherings again. So how about a jazz hands for Jim Hageman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3559)|
| 0:59:29| Thank you for your service, and we'll celebrate you a little bit more when we are allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| gather again. Also, Dr. Lyons, who's been helping me so much in these first few months of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3578)|
| 0:59:47| administration, and also helped throughout Mayor Rojero's administration, and also was on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3587)|
| 0:59:55| throughout Bill Haslam's administration and helped out as a, you know, his professorial and academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| consultant role prior to that. He's been an integral part of Knoxville city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| for many, many years. So he is retiring, I think, before our next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3609)|
| 1:00:18| So I wanted to end, but the good news is, because we have this crisis, I asked him to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| continue to be an advisor to me in a more informal capacity. And I'm grateful that he accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| to do that. He's also, as you saw in your agenda, has agreed to be appointed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| Civil Service Mayor Board to take the place of someone whose term was expiring. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| Dr. Lyons, also, we want to celebrate you, and we will wait till we can gather and do it in groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| of more than 10, because I know there are many, many people who appreciate all that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| to contribute to the city over the years. And I know, you know, I'm super grateful personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| for all that you have done, and I know you're going to continue to do in a slightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| you know, just different capacity. So thank you, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| Okay, that's not a very great celebration, but it's the best we can do under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| And we'll do, yeah, thank you, Vice Mayor. We'll do this more properly later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| but I did just want to acknowledge both of those people who are, you know, such big parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| city and won't be with us in the same capacity by the time we meet again. Okay, one other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3691)|
| 1:01:41| I already got an answer from Cheryl Ely on the Parks and Rec signs. They should be up Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3701)|
| 1:01:48| or Saturday. Okay, okay. So now let's go to, I guess item eight is on consent, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3708)|
| 1:02:04| Okay, so why don't you take it from here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3724)|
| 1:02:19| Article 9 provides Table 9-1 to identify two family buildings as permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| in the I-MU District, Knoxville-Knox County Planning Applicant Hall Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| Move to approve. Second. Motion made by Ms. Ryder, seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| Roll call vote, please. Just a quick discussion. Oh, discussion, sorry. Or a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| I just wanted to explain my vote last time on this item, and the issue that I had with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3766)|
| 1:02:56| item was the enforcement that was included with it, and it brought up larger questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| And now that we are living in the context that we're living in, I'm going to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3782)|
| 1:03:13| you know, just because it's not that tantamount. But I have a question into the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| about what is happening with codes enforcement right now. Are folks who are sheltering in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| going to be penalized when their yards are growing at the moment? If somebody does have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| a broken down bus in their church parking lot right now, is that going to be an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| for codes enforcement over the next couple of months? So, I just wanted to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| bring that up since this was somewhat relevant, that my hope is that we do not have codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| enforcement worried about these issues during the pandemic. Can we ask Mr. Ahrens to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3830)|
| 1:04:00| the codes enforcement? Mr. Bryce, did you want to speak to that? And then Mr. Ahrens may wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| as well. Yeah, just very quickly. I think our team has had a discussion with codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| about the situation we're in. And let me back up. I think all city employees understand that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| duties several weeks ago are very different now. And so, we may utilize someone in codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| enforcement to go help deliver mobile meals or to go check on an individual in a home. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| that message has been very clear. And Ms. Gill and the mayor and other folks on the team have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| been working with benefits and with civil service to make sure that we have policies in place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| allow us to be that flexible. We feel comfortable we've got those. But our codes enforcement staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| has also been advised to obviously work towards solutions to help folks out and to be less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| proactive. Because we understand right now that the ability for doing some basic maintenance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| lawn mowing is just going to be tough. And so, yes, they're aware of that. Mr. Ahrens is aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| of that. We will huddle up and discuss that throughout. I also want members of council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| know that our number one job in the field is to help connect people with resources. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| even before the COVID situation, if we had an individual that we needed to connect to CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| or to connect to other social service resources or our community development department, that's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| first tool. Educate, connect. And again, the enforcement is always later. So, I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| answered your questions. Thank you, Mr. Brace. Any further discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3941)|
| 1:05:51| Ms. Ryder? No? Okay. Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=3951)|

| 1:06:58| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Councilman Ryder. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| Ms. Kessler? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| I'd like to ask Mr. Ahrens, I do have a question on this, where it relates to the notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| in the Sentinel. With the low circulation, with low subscriptions of the Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| are there other platforms where these notices are being pushed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| And just kind of wanted to get some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| Mr. Ahrens? Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Can you hear me? I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Okay. This language is pretty much verbatim of what the previous code had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| and I think we're open to, I'll talk with our law department to see if there's other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| I think the public currently knows that's where to look, so they know that's where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| notices are located. I think it's important to keep it there, but I do think we can research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4081)|
| 1:08:10| avenues for additional postings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| That was my only, I just think, you know, it's a good opportunity with RECOVE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| you know, this is a fresh start to, you know, how can we introduce other platforms for information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| Again, given if people don't subscribe or can't access Knox News or the Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| that was my only thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Sure. I'll be happy to look into it with our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| And see if there's other opportunities available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4123)|

| 1:10:33| I know that on the governor's update today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| he was suggesting that schools be out another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| Did this come from the governor, or was this the Knox County school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| The governor suggested it, and now Knox County schools has followed his suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| Okay, very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4248)|

| 1:11:27| Just my only thought, has there been any other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| to designate another street to rename in honor of our troops, if this one's closing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4290)|
| 1:11:40| Not to my knowledge, Mr. Bates, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| I think we've thought about the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| but I think we would want to discuss that with Council if we've got ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I think it will stay open as a street until construction actually starts in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4309)|
| 1:12:00| So I think we've got a little time to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| but I don't mind giving you a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| and I can talk with Council about some potential other locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| because that is an idea that we have thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4330)|
| 1:12:10| I just wanted to know, that did cross my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I'd love to pursue that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Okay, what I'll do is give you a call, and we'll discuss next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4335)|

| 1:22:34| I only want to start this discussion because KUB doesn't come in front of us very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| I appreciate what they're doing to try to help people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| Just because we don't see them very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| I still would really like to see them work on the basic fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| If you look at, it's just not a fair assessment that a small apartment and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4971)|

| 1:23:11| Well, I would just add to that since KUB has signed this new contract with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=4991)|
| 1:23:20| that we don't have any controlling authority over that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| But we can encourage them to use the partner credits that they've just received under TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| for low-income assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Go towards that rate relief, which I think they've already mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| But also forgiving or providing funds to help our low-income neighbors through this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5021)|
| 1:23:51| I'm happy that they're not going to shut off utilities during this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| But I also want to see them use those credits that they have through that TVA contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| to apply that to our low-income residents who are going to be suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5040)|

| 1:29:10| Okay, motion carries. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| 7N is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| The City of Knoxville respectfully requesting the City Administration to consider and allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| emergency funding for certain programs to assist Knox civilians, and to also assess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| all current taxes, fees, penalties, and tax deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5376)|
| 1:29:43| Did I make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Yeah, Ms. Parker makes the motion. This is the resolution that came to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Seconded by Ms. Singh. So the motion was made by Ms. Parker, seconded by Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| Discussion, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Okay, yes. So a couple of questions just for point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| So when we state here, I'm looking at it now, hold on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| emergency funding to analyze and assess the need for additional emergency funding to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| certain programs. When we talk about rental assistance programs, are we talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| HUD and Section 8, or are we talking about a different demographic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| I just need to get a little clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| Yes, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| When I originally proposed this idea, I brought it initially to the administration and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| our attorney first. And in that proposal, I wanted to direct it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| the rental assistance fund that I knew was administered by CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| When I brought that forward, I was kind of given a heads up that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| it would be better for the administration to have some flexibility to direct those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| where the needs arise, whether that's through CAC, whether that's through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| I've seen a couple of other programs that are offering rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5484)|
| 1:31:32| And so once the city, once the administration assesses where there might be additional need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5492)|
| 1:31:41| so that we can, as leaders in the community, be promoting these programs aggressively and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| have confidence to know that when it comes to our social safety net, we're doing all we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5508)|
| 1:31:57| to keep it strong. We know that we're going to need additional support coming into this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| but there are some things that we can do as a city in the coming days and weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| until that assistance arrives. And this, the purpose of the fund and the flexibility of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5530)|
| 1:32:19| was just to show city council support for us to direct emergency funds as the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5539)|
| 1:32:26| identifies those priorities to these specific needs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5546)|
| 1:32:33| Okay. A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| To clarify, so this is just a resolution at this point to assess these different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| what the needs are, and yet there hasn't been a proposed amount that's being recommended with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| Is that correct? Right. I had initially attached an amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| and learned that that is essentially making a line item budget change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| which the city council does not have the authority to do. So the only thing we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| do when it comes to wanting to see monies directed in our budget or emergency spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| towards the most vulnerable in our community, the only thing we can do is pass a resolution asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| the administration to look into it and create the plan that they feel is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5604)|
| 1:33:32| If I would just speak to this. And first, my reading of this, and thank you for submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| it Councilwoman Parker, is that you want me and my administration to do whatever we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| to help the vulnerable people who are affected by this virus. And in all respects, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5627)|
| 1:33:55| housing, homeless support, youth support, you mentioned a lot of things. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| first of all, rest assured we are doing that already, but a resolution to encourage us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| continue to do that, I have no objection to that at all. I think it just shows that council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| encouraging us to do this. And you guys can share your suggestions as you work in the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| hear things that we can be thinking about. That's totally fine. One thing I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| suggest as a possible, just a language amendment to change the word assess to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| evaluate, because when you use the word assess right next to taxes, it's just confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| So I would just maybe change the word assess in the top and everywhere. You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5676)|
| 1:34:47| If someone would be interested in making an amendment to change that word, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| would be good. It's in several places. But I appreciate the spirit and values behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5691)|
| 1:35:00| You know, I think it's fine. I don't think that, I think it just reinforces and will expand and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5700)|
| 1:35:09| reinvigorate our energy doing this work already. And so may I also want to finish my comment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5709)|
| 1:35:18| say that I think that we are already looking into this same line of logic as far as what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5718)|
| 1:35:26| agencies and programs that are out there providing the support already. And I do think that for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| to start maybe evaluating those needs now, and I know that they're looking at that as well. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| CAC has a rental assistance program in place currently in some other agencies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, and I think that we all can attest to first case in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| of Tennessee being seen on March the 5th, and here we are the 24th, and we now have over 600 cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| is that we are continuing to see that spread. And these needs are going to increase as people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| not able to work. Different factors come into play that go along with these types of pandemics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| that I think we will seriously need to know what are those needs? How can the city assist while we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| are waiting for potentially federal funding or whatever the state may have available to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| as well? So I would be in favor based on those circumstances. I just want to add as well that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5786)|
| 1:36:34| you know this all of these programs are extremely critical and I'm very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| We will soon, hopefully sooner rather than later, have to address re-employment. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5799)|
| 1:36:47| I just want to mention that as a focus for the administration to be thinking about now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| because we will need that immediately. And also I missed a chance earlier to commend that Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| Chamber has done a great job of identifying all the companies that are hiring. So as people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| laid off they've developed a web page with a list of all the employers who are hiring, for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| Kroger and some other grocery stores. So for those who are already have been unemployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| can be re-employed as much as quickly as possible. So I also want to add any employer who is hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5839)|
| 1:37:27| should contact the Chamber. I've been working with them closely and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| they're doing a good job. So I don't think we need necessarily to amend this to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| employment, but just that it's right around the corner at the top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| Thank you Mayor. Council Member Smith brings up an excellent point and I kind of want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| go back to briefly the transportation issue because we have seen that there are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| grocery stores that are hiring people for restocking those types of things. And so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| we look at the CAT doing the temporary, you know, no fees for ridership, you know, I'm kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5880)|
| 1:38:09| thinking about those people that may be dependent upon CAT to be able to get to jobs. So I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| to maybe ask along yourself, along with Council Member Parker, if we could have some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| additional conversation with CAT to say could we even in this evaluating the needs, if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5901)|
| 1:38:29| could be some funds potentially or grant maybe that's out there for a work pass for people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| are trying to get back on their feet and don't necessarily have access to be able to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| the transportation to get to work. So just a side note, but I know that, you know, a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| are being laid off, especially folks that are in the service and hospitality industry that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| looking for any type of employment that they can get to be able to take care of their families to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| the best of their ability. So that transportation I think is going to be one that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| evaluate a little bit more. So if you guys don't mind to bubble up on that, I'd really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| that. Ms. Ryder. Yeah, and I just wanted to insert, I know we've all been hit by a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5946)|
| 1:39:14| concerns from our area businesses, which is where, you know, some of the businesses are owned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| locally, by our neighbors and our friends, our constituents, as well as their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| our neighbors, our friends, our constituents that are now finding themselves in a position of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| not being able to make payroll, not be able to make tax payments, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| I did tune into Congressman Burchett's talk last Friday, and he mentioned that one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5976)|
| 1:39:45| in discussion, which I'm going to say there are a lot of things, but pertinent to this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| are the SBA loans. That's a hard thing for me to recommend to some of these small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| in talking to someone who represents a bunch of them today. You know, some of them are used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| having about $4,000 a week coming in to be able to make all their bills, cover their overhead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| and they're now reduced to $2,000 or less a week. You know, that might be what they're looking at on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| the books. And to turn around and tell them that a loan is their option, that's hard. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| Congressman Burchett is pushing for, and I hope more people in Congress are, that the disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| funding that's being directed to the SBA ends up being grants. There will be some strings attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6028)|
| 1:40:36| to it being granted. So, maybe one thing that we can look at as in our role is to reach out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6036)|
| 1:40:45| our legislators and say, you know, to please vote to make that grant instead of loans. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6045)|
| 1:40:54| most of these businesses max themselves out on loans just to get the doors open and create these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| businesses in our community that in turn help fund our firefighters, our police, our city workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| And to ask them to take a loan to cover a pandemic is just mounting them up with another loan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| they can't. Now, the turnaround time on the, according to the Congressman's staff, is anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| from two days to two weeks at this point. So, if you guys have businesses contacting you or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6078)|
| 1:41:24| anybody's listening, they need to apply as soon as possible. If they need that, what I've told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| the Congressman's office is that people need to hear sooner than later that it's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| grant, it's going to be a grant. Because some of them are just going to go out of business and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| apply because they just can't take on another loan. So, anyway, that's what I'm hoping for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| and that's my comment on this conversation. Thank you. Ms. Fugin. Thank you. As a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| longtime banker, I would recommend people go ahead and apply. Better to apply than miss the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6113)|
| 1:42:01| opportunity to apply because I suspect it will convert to a grant. I mean, there's no guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6121)|
| 1:42:09| that it would be worth applying before you let yourself go out of business, but that's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| conversation. But perhaps in two weeks, we, as a council, could do a resolution as our city, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| city council, encouraging that that would be a grant. So, Mr. Frost, can I work with you on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6141)|
| 1:42:30| Happy to do so. Okay, I'll have some for us in two weeks. Thank you, Ms. Fugin. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| McKenzie, just as far as the transportation, I mean, just to clarify, cab is fare free for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| everybody right now. So, people who are getting to their jobs don't need a special pass. They just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| can get on the bus and ride to their jobs if the bus route goes there. I was a little confused about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6167)|
| 1:42:56| your question. Well, so I'm kind of, I was going along the lines of if this pandemic continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6176)|
| 1:43:05| but yet grocery stores are going to be essential businesses that have to stay open and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| to have employees to stop those folks that may depend on transportation. So, I think we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| probably just take it offline maybe with Council Member Parker as well. I'm just going to flush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| out a little bit. Thank you, though. Sounds good. Any further discussion on Item 11M? Ms. Fugin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6204)|
| 1:43:34| Is Ms. Parker going to make an amendment to change from assessment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6214)|
| 1:43:42| evaluate? Yes. I mean, that was a friendly suggestion from the Mayor. I just wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| if we were going to do that because I will second your motion to amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| Yes, I would like to make such a motion to amend. Okay, motion to amend to substitute the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6236)|
| 1:44:04| assess, take the assess out and replace it with evaluate. And I think it occurs at least three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| places, four places. So, that's the motion by Ms. Parker, by Ms. Fugin. Any discussion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6251)|
| 1:44:20| amendment? Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, would you like a roll call vote on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6260)|
| 1:44:27| Council Member Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| Council Member Ryder? Yes. Council Member Bursa? Yes. Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| Unmute yourself there. Yes. Council Member Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6280)|
| 1:44:56| Unmute. Unmute. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6301)|
| 1:45:18| Okay, the motion passes and the next item is 12A. No, that was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6318)|
| 1:45:27| Oh, that was the amendment, sorry. Okay, back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6327)|
| 1:45:34| Any further discussion? Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, can you conduct a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6334)|
| 1:45:42| Council Member Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| Council Member Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| Council Member Bursa? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| Okay, the motion carries. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| 12A is an emergency ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to amend section 4-39| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6377)|
| 1:46:24| of the Knoxville City Code to authorize certain permit holders to deliver beer directly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| customers during the COVID-19 pandemic within the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| Motion made by Council Member Roberto, seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| Any discussion? Mr. Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| Thank you, Mayor. I mentioned this in the beginning when we added this to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| This is really an attempt to help support our local businesses. It's something that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6416)|
| 1:47:05| able to do because of the executive order issued by the Governor, and I think we want to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6425)|
| 1:47:12| encourage innovation in this challenging time, try to keep as many of our businesses open as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| and keep, very importantly, keeping folks employed. And if this gives them an opportunity to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| you know, find some avenues for business and keep people getting those paychecks that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| really need to support themselves and their families, then I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| This would only be in effect as long as the executive order is in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| and I hope everyone would be able to support it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| I just want to add, particularly, the reason I sponsored this as well is that there are four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| businesses in South Knoxville who confirmed they would be able to keep a person employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| as a result of this, so every bit counts, particularly for these small retail shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6478)|
| 1:48:07| Mr. Thomas. Yeah, I had some of the same responses as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| Councilperson Smith in the 5th District as well. I also want to commend the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| on moving on this quickly without short notice and being really efficient in getting this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| us in time to help some folks. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| Thank you, Mayor. I usually try to speak up for addiction issues and alcoholism issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6510)|
| 1:48:38| and I think this would be a very different discussion if times weren't as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| so I am going to support it. Thanks. Thank you, Ms. Singh. Any further discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| Council Member Orto. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| Council Member Singh. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| Council Member Smith. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| Council Member Testerman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| Council Member Thomas. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| Yes. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| Yes. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| Yes. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| Yes. Okay, the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| That is the last item on our agenda, and because of the extenuating circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| was anybody who submitted public forum comments to the recorder's office, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| No, ma'am. We did not receive any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| Okay, well that concludes public forum. I know we'll try to give people a little more advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| warning before we do this next time, so if they want to submit comments in written format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| we'll do so. We'll figure out other ways to do it, but thank you all for your patience. I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| this went pretty well, all things considered. If you all have suggestions for how we can improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| during the next two weeks, please share them with Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| Be more Zoom-suitory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| Okay, so unless there's anything else anyone wanted to say, I'd like to adjourn this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6619)|
| 1:50:27| Thanks, everyone. Be safe. Bye-bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200324?start=6627)|
