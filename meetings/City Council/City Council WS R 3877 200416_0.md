| 0:03:08| Our employees are our most important resource as we serve the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=192)|

| 0:03:15| workforce and in our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=195)|

| 0:03:20| administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=200)|

| 0:03:28| the effort in a more concerted way a couple of years ago and even went as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| far as budgeting a couple of positions for it in the FY20 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| And I have taken a look at the work that previous administrations have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| done and feel responsible to continue the conversation and to help ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| that the city remains a model employer that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| practicing 21st century best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| I'm going to give a short overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Well, I don't know how short, but thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| And we can, you know, take a few questions during this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| but as you see in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| there's someone from the civil service merit board who's going to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| I guess that will be Vicki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| And then the presentation of the ordinance, like the nitty gritty details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| that's going to be presented by George Shields and Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| So with, so please know that there's nitty gritty questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| I would ask you to save those for that portion of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| So one of the most important things I want you to get from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=265)|
| 0:04:34| Hi councilwoman Parker. Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| I'm giving a presentation just a little background before we get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| other parts of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| So one of the most important things I want you all to take away from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| from my discussion is that I'm fully committed to support the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| And I want that to be true, not just for my administration, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| but for whoever may be mayor in the future and whoever may be on council in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Merit based examination, certification, appointment, and promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| That is super important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Prohibiting discrimination of course is vital and disciplining people only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| for cause and ensuring that all appeals and grievances are heard and resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| through fair proceedings. I'm fully committed to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Those are in place now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| and I want to make sure that those protections are sustained and protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| and continue in every possible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| Re-establishing the human resources department is not going to impair or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| diminish the rights benefits or privileges of civil service employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| established in the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| And you'll we'll get into the specific language about that later on when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| George and Charles shared, you know, go into the legal aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| And I know we have what three lawyers on council and other people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| really good at reading into delving into these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| So I'm glad George and Charles are here to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| help with that level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| I believe firmly that restoring an HR department will strengthen the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| service merit system by enabling the merit board to use its resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| to focus exclusively on its charter based function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| ensuring that personnel actions continue to be made on the basis of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| I feel this is so important that, that the integrity of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| so integrity of that crucial civil service function is so important that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| now there's an inherent conflict of interest present when the same entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| that's responsible for providing impartial review of personnel related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| decisions is the same one making those decisions in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| And so that's what we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| And it results in employees questioning the integrity of the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| One of the important benefits of establishing an HR office is that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| resolves this conflict of interest and helps the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| the civil service. Wait a second. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| It helps us monitor the city's personnel system more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| I mentioned this also, I was going to share this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| share this with you by email, but I just didn't get a chance to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I can send it as a follow-up later tonight or tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| I asked the municipal technical advisory service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| MTAS to tell me what other cities and towns across the state do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| And they surveyed cities and towns across Tennessee and the vast majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| every single one that they surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| And I think they got responses from about 20 have an HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| except Knoxville and two cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Nashville and Memphis have an HR and a civil service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| We're the only one that only has civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| And I recognize that our civil service department currently performs some HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| functions, but we're the only one with this unusual arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| where civil service merit board is also performing these, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| HR functions. It's, it's something that I haven't seen in any other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| And MTAS, I appreciate their help in doing that survey for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| So I use the term reestablished in HR because we'd actually be returning to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| structure that existed in the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| The city had a personnel department that performed all the functions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| now being proposed in the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| It was responsible for the administration of all personnel things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| And the merit board focused on the charter function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| ensuring that her personnel actions were made on the basis of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| This change happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| It was actually Janet's father, Kyle Testerman was mayor at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| and they were undergoing some budget constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| And then the Roach was the head of civil service at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| And he asked her if she would be willing and able to merge those roles for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| the sake of a budget. And she agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| And, and then, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| it has been in that structure ever since there was no charter change at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| time. And I'm not proposing a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| To undo that and restore an HR function either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| So as much as it is so important to protect employees from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| discrimination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| employees need a lot more than just protection from discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| They also need and deserve training, career paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| modern recruitment and retention strategies and support to deal with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| kinds of workplace challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| including the ones we're facing right now with COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| So a few of the things that I would like to share with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| that I would anticipate an HR department overseeing our marketing and talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| acquisition. A lot has changed since the 1980s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| especially the labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| You are all really familiar with the challenges we face in all departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| but in particular, our law enforcement and trying to recruit people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| An HR department would be able to go on beyond the civil service charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| has a recruitment function where you post vacancies and accept applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| And they would still be responsible for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| but there's a lot more to recruitment and retention than just posting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| posting a opening to the website. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| that's one of the things I think HR can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| And I'm also looking forward to the Ackerman report that is going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| that we asked a marketing entity to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| to examine how we do KPD enforcement, recruitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| That's going to be coming out next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| And I think that some of their recommendations will be very well suited for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| something like an HR department to, to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Another function I want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I would hope that an HR department would take over is classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| compensation and performance pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| This would enhance our recruitment intention and really allow us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| And this is something I think that is probably most important to employees is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| the compensation and classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| These are functions that were formally performed by the personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| And we need to be able to compensate our employees fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| And in a way that's consistent with the market and to be able to devise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| surveys and so forth that are consistent with modern labor market practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| that we, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| we are working hard to attract people to work for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| and it's people have a lot of other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| So we need to ensure that our compensation and performance pay policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| you know, are up to speed with the modern labor market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| And another really important function that we are really lucky to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| great managers in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| but it sort of happens in an ad hoc manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| So I would love for an HR department to more proactively help manage that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| supervisors develop a positive workplace culture and focus on developing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| supporting that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| So people know how to appropriately develop the people that they oversee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| do progressive discipline as, as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| And just, just be able to train our managers to be effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| as effective as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| I'd also want an HR department to work on our on-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| onboarding and orientation functions. We, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| we have some capacity in that area right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| but I think it could be better. And I think that would help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| cultivate long, successful and productive careers that better serve our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| So that's a little bit of an overview of what is why I'm bringing this to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| table right now. And that it's not a new thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| It's been something that's been in the works for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| Several administrations and mayor O'Haro, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| worked really hard on it for the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| but then just got busy and ran out of time with her administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| So I'm just taking it from, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| hopefully from third plate to home base and in collaboration with our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| with you all, of course, and with our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| So now I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| I guess vice mayor McKenzie, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| I can take some questions or we can segue into Vicki Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| She's the executive secretary of the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| And I think she's going to be presenting the next agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| but I can take a few questions now or we can wait till later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| whatever you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Do any council members have any specific questions for the mayor at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| juncture, based on the information that she just shared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Table any questions until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| So we actually asked Vicki Hatfield to dial into the meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| participate to answer questions of council members toward the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| We actually had requested a member of the civil service merit board to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| on the call today to share their position or their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| their feedback regarding this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| They did have a call yesterday and they elected a new chair of their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| which is Jamie Ballinger. And congratulations to Ms. Ballinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| the board tabled this particular topic because they did need to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| additional due diligence and had a lot of additional information that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| into them that they needed to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| They are going to take this up at their May 2nd meeting and they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| So what the council will do is we will ask them to log into our council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| meeting when this item will be on the agenda to share with us their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| their position and their, and their comments and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| So at this time we'll go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| we'll move to the presentation of the ordinance at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| I think I was going to be first on that. This is Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| I don't know if anybody recognizes my voice or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| but this is Charles and I would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| the ordinance know that the things that you all have heard some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| about has to do with whether or not this ordinance is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| So I'm going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| I'm going to move to the presentation of the ordinance at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| This ordinance has to do with whether or not through adoption of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| ordinance, we are in any way going to impair the civil service protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| afforded to employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| which currently exists under the charter of the city of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| And I want you to understand that that is not what is happening with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| regard to this ordinance. This is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| This is not a charter change. And that's very important because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| charter protections that are afforded to city employees are protections that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| are afforded in the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| And an ordinance couldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| even if it wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| an ordinance couldn't trump those charter provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| It's just like it works in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| in the state government where a state statute cannot trump the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Neither can a federal statute trump the provisions of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| constitution for all practical purposes for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Our charter is our constitution and we cannot do anything by ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| would impair the provisions of that charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| So I want you just to be aware of that fact up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| And it was never the intention of this mayor or any other mayor that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| worked with, with regard to this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| to try to impair any of the protections afforded to employees with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| to merit-based hiring, merit-based promotions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| discipline being administered only with just cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| All of those things are the core functions of the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| They will continue to be the core functions of the civil service merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| and they will be strictly adhered to as the charter requires that they be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| And I want you to know that when you look at this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| and George Shields is going to go through this ordinance in great detail for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| you in just a minute, but as you go through the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| there are a couple of things I want you to note particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| One, which I don't think George will note for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| is in the 12th whereas clause in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| you will find the words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| the mayor's recommended reorganization does not in any way diminish or impair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| the civil service merit system rights and privileges afforded by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| charter to city employees in the classified service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| That is right there in the ordinance. It says so in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| We put it in the ordinance because we want any court who interprets for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| reason to understand that it was never our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| I had to, I had to okay my video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| which is really a bad idea on anybody's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| But at any rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| what I was saying is it was never our intent to impair the charter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| And that's why we've said so particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| and we put those words in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| So a court, when it goes back and looks at this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| we put those words in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| So a court when it goes back and somebody wants to challenge something based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| their charter protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| we want the court to know that we never intended to impair their charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| protections with this ordinance in any way says so right there in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| After talking at some length with chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| who's been talking to some of her folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| she felt like it would be a good idea to put some additional language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| with regard to, to assuring the employees that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| this is not an effort to impair their charter protections that are in civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| service. And so we have made a change in section six of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| And George, we'll go over that with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| but based on the recommendation of chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| we have made the change to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| That's where it talks about where the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| what the functions of the HR department will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| what the responsibilities of the HR director and the functions of the HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| department will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| And the first thing that we're going to say there is subject to the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| service protection afforded to employees under the city charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| the department of human resources shall operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| And then it will list the various things that the department of human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| resources shall do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| But we're going to say right up front that this is not in any way intended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| impair those civil service protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| It is subject to the civil service protections afforded to the employees under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| the charter. So I just wanted to get that out front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| let you all know that that's what our intent was in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| And that's how we have crafted this ordinance in a way that protects the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| civil service protections of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Now I'm going to turn it over to George Shields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| who knows all the details of this ordinance and knows the history of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| And he's going to go through the operative sections of the ordinance with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| in a sort of a line by line basis to help you understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| And you might want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| if you have questions as he goes along in particular sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| if you have questions with regard to the section that he's on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| you might go ahead and address those questions as he goes through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| sections because that might be more helpful to you. George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you, Charles. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| And thank you to the members of the council for providing the opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| me to go over this ordinance with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I've provided a PDF version of the ordinance to Will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| and I think Will will be able to share that on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| So no matter what your situation is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| we'll all be literally reading off the same page together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| And then Will, if you can, if you can start us off on section one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1238)|
| 0:20:49| Okay, great. Is, is everybody able to see sections one and two there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| Okay. And so like Charles mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| what I'm going to be doing is going section by section with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| And so section one is the start of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Before I get into that though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| I want to touch on some of the background elements that others have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| First is that this is an ordinance to reestablish the former personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| department and then rename it the department of human resources and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| empower it to administer the city's personnel system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| So at the broadest possible level, that's what this ordinance is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| At the same time though, as the mayor and as Charles had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| the ordinance preserves all of the civil service protections guaranteed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| city employees under the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| And this is both by design because this administration does not want to alter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| those protections and also by law, because as Charles said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| no ordinance by itself could amend the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| And moreover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| no charter amendment is necessary to accomplish the objectives of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| ordinance because when our current charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| the one we have today was drafted and approved by referendum in 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| the city had a personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| In fact, the city had had a personnel department under various names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| accountable to the mayor for more than a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| By that point, our charter was therefore written and approved with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| understanding that both civil service and a personnel department already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| And after our charter took effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| both entities continue to coexist again under the very same charter we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| today for another six years until,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| as the mayor mentioned for budgetary reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| the personnel department was eliminated and its functions were transferred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| So this ordinance ultimately is restoring the arrangements that the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| had in mind at the time it was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| And it also adds some additional functions to the HR department that aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| currently being performed on a citywide basis by any department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| And one of those examples is employment marketing and outreach and talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| acquisition. We'll talk about that a little further in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| So with that background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| section one is repealing the old ordinance from 1986 that eliminated the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| And we don't often include a repeal language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Sometimes we just move on to making the changes without going back and finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| the source for the change that we're undoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| But we thought it was important here to put that right up front to illustrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| again that we're trying to maintain consistency with what the charter itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| had in mind. This isn't something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| This is returning to a model that we used to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Section two does two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| It first corrects, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| a past drafting oversight that resulted in the department of employee benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| and risk management being omitted from the list of the city's departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| And because we're having to make some changes to the employee benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| department's functions, this was the appropriate time to make that housekeeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| fix. And then second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| you'll see it also adds the Department of Human Resources to that same list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| So these two will be added onto a long list of existing departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| sort of taking their place alongside peer departments in this section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| code. And then, Will, if you're ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| I'll be glad to move on to section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| So section three is confirming something that is already true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| The director of law is already responsible for advising the mayor on official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| acts and on other matters of legal consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| That existing responsibility already includes advising the mayor on the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| administrative rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| which is one of the two bodies of rules that govern most of the day-to-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| aspects of employment at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| And so this section is simply confirming that existing reality in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| for the avoidance of any doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| And because we're going to be talking about the administrative rules later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| this was the appropriate time to sort of recognize that reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Section four is both deleting a function and adding a function to the list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| those functions that are performed by the employee benefits department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| It first deletes responsibility for developing employees through training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| In practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| what employee benefits does in the training space right now is focused on its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| risk functions. It's about occupational safety and health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| and related risk prevention type training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| It's not holistic training in the way that you might think of a corporate HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| department offering training on a variety of subjects to a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| employees. And so in some respects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| deleting that is just recognizing the reality that that department is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| providing citywide training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| And we intend the HR department to provide that citywide training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| So we first have to delete it from the employee benefits section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| But then we're also adding to the employee benefits section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| the responsibility for administering both paid and unpaid forms of leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| Currently leave is divided between employee benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| which handles leave pursuant to the family and medical leave act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and then also civil service, which handles most other forms of leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| This ordinance would consolidate all those types of leave under the benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| department, which happens to also be the heading that our city code already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| uses to categorize leave. It's categorized as a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| And so that covers section three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| I'll be glad to move on to five and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Five and six is a little bit of housekeeping as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| Five particularly is six is more than housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Five is deleting the current requirement that the employee benefits director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| reports to the finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| It hasn't been the case that that has been the reporting arrangement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| some time. And so this change is again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| just confirming our existing practice. Section six though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| does more than that. And we're going to spend several slides on section six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Section six starts to reestablish the personnel department under the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| the department of human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| And the next several slides will lay out the details of the department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| duties and functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| So first you may have seen in the code where departments are created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| There's usually a description of the duties of the director and then usually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| description of the functions of the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So this is the first half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| This would establish the duties of the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| And so it would say first that the HR director is the city's chief human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| resources officer. You'll see that there in the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| The ordinance would direct that except in cases where some personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| responsibility is assigned elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| the responsibility for personnel matters would rest with this director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| This language is patterned off of similar language used to describe the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| director's role. And similar with finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| where there are financial functions happening in other places other than just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| in the finance department, but ultimately the responsibility rests with finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| This language also recognizes that there are existing personnel functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| happening in other parts of the city. For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| obviously the civil service merit board has a place in the personnel system and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| where it has expressed roles to play, those roles are preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| There's no change, but also directors have existing roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Other than the HR director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| each director is a hiring authority for their department and each director is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| disciplinary authority when disciplinary issues arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| And so that language is designed to preserve their existing responsibilities as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| well. It's in those gaps where there aren't some existing authority that the HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| director fills the gap. And so, and finally, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| as Charles mentioned as the first Senate states right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| all of this is subject to the existing civil service protection afforded to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| employees under the city charter. Well, okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| So now we move into the department's functions list and this will take a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| minutes to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| So the first section is HR numbered. And so the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| the first two first is enhancing the relationship between the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| This is something that HR would have in common with employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| If you, if you were to look up the corresponding section that describes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| employee benefits, they're also tasking with enhancing that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| It makes sense that HR would have a role in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| So the next section is employment marketing outreach and talent acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| programs. This is already happening in some departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| but it's only happening on a department by department basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| you've already heard and you're already aware that KPD engages in some in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| marketing on its own and public service and fleet services do some of that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| This ordinance builds on that existing reality by making it a citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| So it's not just HR with delivering on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| At the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| civil service will continue to perform its charter based recruitment function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| namely posting vacancies and accepting applications as well as its examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| and certification functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| In other words, this marketing function goes beyond what civil service does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| but it doesn't take away from what civil service does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Okay. Moving on to number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| the list of HR department functions section six part three here next assigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| the HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| the responsibility for a class of functions that have been referred to as post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| selection, but still pre-employment processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| These are things like background checks and medical and psychological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| examinations and pre-employment drug and alcohol testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| While these are currently coordinated by civil service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| these functions are closely aligned with the risk management department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| standards are typically set by risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| The pre-employment health related functions in particular were formerly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| performed by the personnel department when the city last had both that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| department and civil service under the current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| And this ordinance restores those functions back to the HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Section six also tasks HR with assisting the city's hiring authorities with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| interviewing and selecting applicants for employment and candidates for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Note that this is an assist function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| So the degree to which one department needs or wants that assistance may vary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| to the extent that directors feel that they would benefit from having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| assistance. The HR department will provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| But again, this does not alter civil services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| charter role and recruitment examination and certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| It's simply providing additional HR expertise to help directors in making the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| decisions that they have to make using the authorities that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| provided to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| And next section six tasks HR with enhancing employee growth and retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| through administering the city's orientation and onboarding functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| citywide training programs and organizational development initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| performance management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| the performance pay program and leadership development and succession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| planning training for supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Moving on now, we're still in section six numbered item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| Section six next assigns to the HR department the responsibility for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| administering the classification and compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Both of these plans were administered by the personnel department when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| city last had both that department and the civil service merit board under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| the current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Several later sections will address classification and compensation plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| in terms of compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Currently compensation recommendations are made by civil service to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| but the mayor decides whether to accept or modify or reject those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| recommendations as part of the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| which of course the council ultimately acts on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Currently, however, the mayor does not have any staff accountable to her to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| assist her in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| This ordinance provides the mayor with the authority to administer the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| classification and compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| However, the mayor does not have any staff accountable to her to assist her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| This ordinance by returning compensation to the HR department solves that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| In addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| this ordinance would jointly task HR and civil service with maintaining the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| city's personnel records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| It would also task HR with responding to public records requests involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| those personnel records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| HR would also provide advice to directors as needed with employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| employment compensation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| Moving on to section seven and eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| section seven is another of those housekeeping fixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| The charter treats classification and compensation as separate plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| plans plural with an S,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| but sometimes the code currently references them as though they were a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| single plan singular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And so section seven is the first of the few housekeeping fixes that aligns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| the code with what the charter has been saying the whole time to fix that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| So we've added an S there onto the end of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Section eight is another housekeeping fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| It deletes an old transitional provision that was used when the city first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| transitioned to having a classification plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| So again, it's just a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| a little pruning of the city code there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Section nine is another of those housekeeping fixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| This section of the code is currently titled maintenance of plan singular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| but because it addresses both the compensation and classification plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| we've added the S on to make sure that it's clear that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| those two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| And we've added the word administration to be consistent with the terms we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| using to describe the maintenance of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| It's a, it's an administering function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| And then section 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| section 10 addresses the classification plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| The code currently assigns responsibility for maintaining the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| plan to the civil service merit board through its executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| And task the executive secretary to periodically review the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| plan and recommend amendments to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| Section 10 assigns those responsibilities to the HR director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| which is consistent with the arrangement that was in effect when the city last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| had both the personnel department and the civil service merit board under our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Section 10 then goes on to add additional language that confirms that the civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| service merit board may monitor the classification plan and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| classification and reclassification of employees in accordance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| provisions of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| This additional language is almost word for word the same as the language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| was in the code when the city last had both the personnel department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| civil service merit board under our current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| Moving on to sections 11 and 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| section 11 deletes a section of the code that tasks the civil service merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| board with making rules related to classification and compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| The civil service merit board gained that authority only after the personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| department was eliminated in 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| The charter itself does not task the board with making these rules as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| returning responsibility for classification and compensation to the HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| department. This section would relocate those rules to the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Hey, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| It's Andrew Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| I had a question about section 11, if we can stay there for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| The, you know, the section that's being deleted here and is about rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| changes, and I know that there's been several questions about and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| about rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Presently, with regard to this, the types of rules that this section is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| particularly referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Those rule changes will be held in a publicly held and noticed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| For the merit board to make rules on any subject, it has to do it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| notice in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| And then I know in this particular ordinance, we're not addressing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| specific rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| So as is, there wouldn't be a requirement to have a publicly noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| meeting or a public meeting about these proposed rule changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| The ordinance doesn't get into that level of detail here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| It's only addressing who is making the rules, but not necessarily the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| mechanics of how the rules are being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| The board makes its rules through that process because of the type of body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| The administrative rules are made ultimately under the authority of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| mayor through a staff process, you know, where the board makes its rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| through a staff process, you know, where the relevant employees in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| city that have expertise on a particular matter, you know, they work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| to recommend change that's vetted through the law department, presented to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| the mayor, and ultimately it's the mayor's to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| So the mechanics of how the rules get made are different in those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| instances because the nature of the final approval is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| One is a body, you know, a board, and the other is an individual elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| That's not to say, though, that the city would not be intending to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| sure there was feedback on those rules, and that's something we're actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| It just means that the mechanics of how that feedback would be received may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| be a little bit different because of the nature of how the rule is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Well, and this may be more of a policy thought, but, you know, one way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| address that would be to just have a public notice of any proposed rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| changes and allow maybe like a 10-day comment period before the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| before the rule change would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I think that something added there, and I understand exactly what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| saying, you know, hey, this is the framework, and then when you get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| the rules, we deal with, you know, some of the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| But addressing that particular concern with some minor changes here, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| think, might alleviate some of that, some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Yeah, I appreciate that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| I'll take that down, and we'll look into that a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Like I mentioned, it's already something we're looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| You know, we want to make sure that employees know that there's a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| for feedback on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| And so I appreciate the suggestion about how we might do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| So if there's no other questions on Section 11, I'll move on to Section 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Section 12 modifies the provision of the code that describes class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| specifications, which are like job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| The code currently says that the Executive Secretary of the Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| Service Merit Board, but not the Board itself, approves and maintains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| this master set of class specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| This section would transfer that responsibility back to the HR director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| which is consistent with the arrangement that was in effect when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| City last had both the Personnel Department and the Merit Board under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| our current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| But again, Section 12 adds additional language that confirms that while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| class specifications will be approved and maintained through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| executive structure, the Civil Service Merit Board may monitor class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| specifications in accordance with the provisions of the City Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| This additional language is almost word for word the same as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| language that was in the code when we last had both that Personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Department and Civil Service Merit Board under our current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2420)|
| 0:40:27| Then moving on to Section 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| Section 13 addresses the procedure that applies when an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| requests a review of their own classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Currently, employees request reclassification through their director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| who can recommend the reclassification or not, to the Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| Secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board, and the Executive Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| makes the decision ultimately on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Section 13 restores almost the same language that was previously in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| code when the City last had both the Personnel Department and the Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| Service Merit Board under our current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| At that time, the employee's request would route through their director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| to the Personnel Department, and the Personnel Director would make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| decision on the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| But an employee at that time could appeal that decision of the Personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| Director to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Section 13 would restore the same arrangement, except Section 13 does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| not permit employees to appeal to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| What does not change, however, is the existing right of an employee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| take a reclassification complaint to the Civil Service Merit Board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| ask that the board investigate whether merit system principles were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| violated, and if the board determines that those principles were violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| to have the board order a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| So, to be perfectly clear, the right to appeal language that you see at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| the end of the section is speaking in terms of being able to appeal beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| the HR Director to, for example, a deputy mayor or a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| This stops the HR decision at the HR professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| It doesn't allow that appeal to go beyond someone who's knowledgeable in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| HR. But again, the charter already says that if an employee has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| complaint related to a violation of merit system principles, the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| can always bring that complaint to the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| The appeal language is not speaking to that arrangement at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| It's speaking to whether you can bypass the HR Director and take your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| complaint on to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| And so I hope that helps to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I know that's been a topic of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| And as we've mentioned already, and as you'll see in other places, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| frequently state that the Civil Service Merit Board may monitor the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| classification and reclassification of employees consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| charter. This section doesn't say that because the old section in the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| didn't say that. But the impact was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| The Merit Board could then monitor those classification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| reclassification matters. And under the ordinance, they would also be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| to monitor those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| George, I've got to. That's Andrew Roberto again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| I've got a question on Section 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| So and I think you identify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| That last line in this particular section about the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| it's final without the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I think that has certainly generated some discussion that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| That might be a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And I think you identified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| But it might be a good place for looking at some amendment there to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| You know, I totally understand what you're saying is that or the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| of saying here is, you know, we're not having folks go directly to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| mayor or deputy mayors to override something that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| But there may be some work needed on that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Because certainly when you read it, it doesn't necessarily convey the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| message that I think you're trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| And then, you know, specifically when you're thinking about the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| rules that the Civil Service Merit Board has, I think there's there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| a rule currently in place about reclassifications being posted for at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| least 10 days prior to reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Is that something that is would be addressed in the rules we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| about earlier that would need to be adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| Or is that something that, you know, we would need to spell out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| in this this framework?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| To your first point, I appreciate your comment there about clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| what the intent of the appeal language is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| That's something that we've mirrored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Like I said, almost word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| What was there previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| But that doesn't mean we necessarily have to to stay with that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| there's a need for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| So as far as the where to address that, that second level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| procedure when it comes to these reclassification requests, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| answer is traditionally up until this point, they have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| addressed in the code that has been left to the underlying rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| to spell out exactly what the mechanics would be beyond what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| see in the code here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| So whether there would be a 10 day comment period is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| something that's only provided for in the Merit Board's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| And so I would anticipate that if the rules were under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| administrative rules in the future, the mechanics of that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| would also be embodied there in that body of rules as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| If that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And I think that's another place to look at for potential amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| because certainly, you know, what you're hearing is a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| concern about reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| And if that was addressed maybe here or if the rules that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| were going to be initially put together were published at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| time, I think that might alleviate some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| OK, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| I'm taking that note down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Mr. Shields, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| This is Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| I would just say I echo some concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Section 2452 in Section 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| That is different than what was discussed at the Civil Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| Merit Board yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Is that correct or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| I feel like there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| So this version that we're looking at, what's the draft date on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| this version that we're going through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| This version was adjusted today, but not in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| The change today was to add the language that Charles referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| that she said that was earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| There hasn't been a change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| OK, so this is exactly what was discussed yesterday at Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| This is something I tried to clarify yesterday on the same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| I echo Councilman Roberto from yesterday's discussion at Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Service Merit Board meeting as well as night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| I don't think it's conveying what you mean for it to convey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| And it's causing a bit of confusion and concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Vice Mayor McKenzie, could I could I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| I don't know how I just want to say I'm reading and hearing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| and I have the same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| And I think, well, this is why we have the workshop is to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| these areas of concern and we'll find a way to fix that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| particular, you know, that make the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| So it reflects what we actually want to, you know, how we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| employees to have the power to appeal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| But and where that would happen and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| So we're taking note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I'm taking note and we'll fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| OK, I'm I'm ready to move on to 14 unless anyone else has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| questions on 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| OK, hearing none for section 14, this is another housekeeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| fix to ensure that consistent with the charter, we refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| the classification and compensation plans in the plural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| rather than the singular to to make sure that we're technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| consistent throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| And then sections 15 and 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Are making compensation related changes consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| restoring that function to the H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Section 15 transfers the responsibility for making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| performance pay rules to the administrative rules rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| in the merit boards rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| And section 16 tasks H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| with conducting compensation surveys and submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| compensation recommendations to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| These functions are currently performed by the H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| These functions are currently performed by civil service, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| they were previously performed by personnel when the city last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| had both the personnel department and the civil service merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| board under our current charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| Well, if you can go to the next slide for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Section 17 makes the same changes we've already discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| related to the administration and maintenance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| classification and compensation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| But it makes those changes applicable to the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| What we've been talking about up until this point are mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| sections that address the general government classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| and compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| The code has sort of trifurcated those things over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| to where there is a distinct sections for general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| for fire and then for police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| And so the substance of the change is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| It just typically has to be made three times to cover all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| So this is doing some of the same work we've already talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| about, but in the fire department section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| And like I mentioned, section 18 is doing the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| regarding performance pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| Then section 19 makes H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| responsible for conducting compensation surveys and submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| compensation recommendations to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| Also applicable to the fire department the same way as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| previously discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Section 20 makes the same changes we've already discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| related to the administration and maintenance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| classification and compensation plans, but now applicable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| the police department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| So you're seeing sort of the third version of those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| to make sure that we're covering everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| Section 21 makes language adjustments to this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| regarding the police department so that it matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| a previous section in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| There's some inconsistency there, but the intent is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| And so this was another housekeeping opportunity to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| sure that like looks like like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| And then section 22 makes the same changes we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| talked about concerning performance pay, but here it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| applicable to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| And then section 23 makes H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| responsible for conducting compensation surveys for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| police department, the same as we previously talked about for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| general government and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Section 24 makes changes to a provision related to annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| leave and comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Currently, the rules and regulations related to annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| leave and comp time are made by the executive secretary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| the Civil Service Merit Board, but with subsequent approval by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| Section 24 would remove the executive secretary's role as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| part of transferring the responsibility for paid leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| to the Department of Employee Benefits and Risk Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| So it's consistent with what we've talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| It just has to be done a little later in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| In section 25 repeats what is already true in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| Charles mentioned this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| It's it's also set out in a whereas clause before we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| into the operative language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| But it's also here in the operative language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| It's it's very clear that nothing in this ordinance shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| impair or diminish the rights, benefits and privileges of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| employees in the classified service to examination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| discipline and retention, except in accordance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| provisions of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| So, like Charles mentioned, we wanted that to be a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| interpretive rule in case a court was ever called upon to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| construe this so that it was clear what the city's intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| was with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| And then section 26 is intended to ensure that any existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| inconsistencies in rules don't override this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| Instead, the ordinance should control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| And this reflects that there there would necessarily be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| changes in rules in order to implement what the ordinance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| But we would not want a situation to arise where before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| all of those changes could be made, some personnel matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| arose and there was confusion about whether a rule or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| ordinance was supposed to decide the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| And so this is another interpretive guide that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| you know, to the extent that there are any inconsistencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| between those two bodies of rules, the ordinance is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| controls, not the inconsistent rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| And then section 27 is designed to preserve the status quo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| other than what the ordinance requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| So it says that other than is set forth in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| nothing in the ordinance should be construed to authorize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| changes to rules either made by the mayor or the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| or to authorize either of them to make any rule that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| currently provided for in the others rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| In other words, except to the extent those changes have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| made by this ordinance, everything else should stay the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Section 28 is just a little bit of lawyering there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| It's a savings clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| You see those frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| It's designed to make sure that if some part of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| was held invalid by court, the remaining sections that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| invalid would continue to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| And then section 29 is the usual statement about when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| would take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| And so with that, I appreciate you letting me go through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| in that level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| And I'll be happy to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3226)|
| 0:53:57| Does anyone have any questions of Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| OK, I think I saw a couple of hands go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| I will go to Council Member Smith first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Mr. Shields, I had a question about section 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Excuse me, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Pardon me, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| And it's regarding when an employee asks for reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| or change to their classification, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| I believe if an employee wants to request a change to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| classification, the employee makes the request to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| director to civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| And currently civil service has the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| And my question is about the process today versus the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| If the director does not agree with the employee's request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| reclassification, is the director required to pass it along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| to civil service today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| In both cases, that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Today it's true and it would be true under the ordinance as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| You know, the director currently can recommend the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| request and can endorse it essentially and pass it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| But even if the director does not endorse it, the employee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| still able to take that request currently to the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| secretary of the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| And under the ordinance, the employee would still be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| take it to the HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3329)|
| 0:55:39| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| So, Mr. Shields, let me see if I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| And I'm learning how all this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| So I may I may have it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| So to follow up on the question from Councilman Smith, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| an employee or a director, let's say it's their director, thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| that their employee should be reclass, they take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| They don't just make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| It goes to Civil Service and Civil Service makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| The executive secretary makes the decision or it goes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| Civil Service Merit Board and the decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| How does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Or the Civil Service, the executive secretary makes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| recommendation to the Merit Board and the Merit Board blesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| I'm not sure how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| That's part one of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I'll let you answer that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I think the answer to your question is the employee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| request does go to the executive secretary and the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| secretary makes the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| But if the employee disagreed with the executive secretary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| decision, you know, and if it was based on some non-merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| basis, the employee would be able to take that decision to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| the full Civil Service Board for them to examine it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| to investigate the decision and perhaps to overturn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| And the same is true under the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| What changes is that the decision is not being made by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| It's being made by the HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| But the employees, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| If there was some non-merit based, you know, consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| involved or a suspicion of some non-merit based consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| the employee would still be able to take that decision on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| the Merit Board for them to continue their function of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| ensuring that personnel actions are made on the basis of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| So right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| If I'm an employee and I think I need to be reclassed or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| if my director thinks I need to be reclassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| We take that to the Civil Service executive secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and it's either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| And I have if we disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| me, the employee or the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| I then file my appeal with the Civil Service executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| secretary or I file my appeal with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| So as a practical matter, I'm not sure that that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| very much. So it's a little murky, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| You would ultimately take it to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| The mechanism that the executive secretary would use to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| facilitate taking it to the board is not entirely clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| It's not it's not well spelled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| But yes, if there was some aspect of the decision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| seemed improper to the employee, something about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| you know, some political views or some kind of discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| or or some other decision that was contrary to merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| principles, regardless of exactly what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| if you will, the logistics of how it gets to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| it does get to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I just don't think it happens very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| And so the procedure is perhaps not as fully fleshed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| as some of the more common procedures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| But the board would hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| So just to wrap up my question, I see Janet raise her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| But so in the future, the way you perceive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| the way this is laid out to work is the the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| and or the director could make that request to the human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| resources director. And if for some reason they disagreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| with the decision of the human resources director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| that's when the civil service merit board secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| executive secretary, director steps in and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| the decider arbitrator of examiner of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| that was a fair, just nonpolitical decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| That's mostly right. I think it would not be the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| secretary individually. I think it would be the executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| secretary facilitating the board's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| It would be the board that would look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| And that's an area where the board's procedures would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| So you could envision the executive secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| you know, facilitating that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| But the objective would be for the board to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| the decider, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| OK, thank you for explaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| Excuse me. Before we go to Councilwoman Testament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| I know that we have Vicki Hatfield that's dialed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| So, Vicki, could you speak to that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| I know that Mr. Shields said that he wasn't as familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| with how many of those instances that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| So if you could speak to that for us, please, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Sure. Can everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Yes. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I think I've expressed that this is one of the parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| of this ordinance that concerns me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| A reclassification is a noncompetitive promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| Basically, it's a process where an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| if they feel they are being worked out of class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| that's what this is, is to correct an issue where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| an employee is being worked out of class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| A lot of employees request reclassifications because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| obviously it's an easy way to get promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| You reclassify me. I don't have to take a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| I don't have to go through a merit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| For that reason, the board makes the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| that govern these reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Those rules are very strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| In my review of a reclassification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| first, we only accept reclassifications once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| It's a yearly process where an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| if they feel they're being worked out of their classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| they can apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| It first goes to their director for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| That director sends it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| whether they recommend it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| and we do take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| At that point, this is a lengthy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| We spend several months reviewing reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Each reclassification has to adhere to strict rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| developed by the merit board that are in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I will tell you that we get a large number of requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| for reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| We award very few reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| For example, this year we did zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| We approved zero reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| The reason for that is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| it is a non-competitive promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| You are promoting an employee without a merit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| The only instances where these are going to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| the criteria set by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| are typically going to be when the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| between the job the employee is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| and the job they're being reclassified to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| is a very fine distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| There's not a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| I'll give you a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I'm a traffic engineering technician one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| I'm asking to be reclassified to a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| that I've been working with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| If you look at those job classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| there's very little distinction between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| The duties are very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| That's an employee saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I've been here for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| They've given me a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| of additional responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I now meet the minimum qualifications for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| I think I've worked up into this second level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Almost every reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| is going to be that exact situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| We are not going to reclassify an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| to a supervisory position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| We are not going to reclassify an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| to a position that should be competed for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| posted and competed by other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| It's literally going to be a step one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| to a step two graduation of duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| in a job series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| That's only if it meets a strict audit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| We actually go out, we audit the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| We do extensive interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| We audit the supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| We audit the managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| We audit the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| After collecting all that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| then we look to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| has this employee met the test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| to move up to that next level of their own job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| That's basically what a reclassification is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| To give blanket approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| a blanket authority for a director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| to make decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| to be able to reclassify an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| from any job class to any job class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| within the merit process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| does not go with Charter 1005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| that says promotions will only be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| within the rules prescribed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| by the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| This is giving the authority for a director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| to award that promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| I can read from way back in 1980| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| when the charter was first revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| This was a letter from the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| actually sent to the mayor at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| with this exact concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| They basically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| reclassifications have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| at the will of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| because the board feels that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| it's their responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| to assign individuals to classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| or to recommend to the appointing authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| reclassifications of positions and individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| Without this control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| reclassifications may be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| to affect a salary increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| to an individual who may not actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| be performing the duties of the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| or may not be qualified for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Accordingly, individuals who may be qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| for the position are not afforded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| an equal opportunity to compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| for that promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| That's why this is an extremely rigid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| It's an extremely restrictive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Even once we do make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| to do those few limited reclassifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| we post that for 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| we allow other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| to provide feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| If I'm a similarly situated employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| and I feel this is unfair to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| they can make an appeal to us on that behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| and we may not approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| that reclassification on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| We may go back to the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| and say this needs to be posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| as a competitive promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| For that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| we do very few reclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| If we were to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| that the reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| was not warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| or if we did one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| that other employees objected to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| they could appeal directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| to the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| I will tell you that in my 21 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| due to the restrictive nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| and how conservative we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| with the reclass process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| there has not been an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| since I have worked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Vicki, could you just clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| one thing you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| You said you got many requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| but you approved zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| What is many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| This year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| I would have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| and look at how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| we actually got for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| In a general year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| we opened this process up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Anyone who wants to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| for a reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| must get that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| by the end of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Then we review those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| because we want that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| if there are going to be reclassifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| we turn that into finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| We work through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| with finance during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| That becomes part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| the class comp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| process with budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| In most years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| we usually get about 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| to maybe 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| 25 requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| In many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| it is an employee wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| a non-competitive promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| In most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| we go back and recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| that the department post it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| as a competitive promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Then another thing that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I am sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| I feel like I am going on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| commented on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| it is a rigorous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| process and it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| a very distinct set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| I would have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| and listen to what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| where does it specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| how that is going to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| under human resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| The ordinance does not specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| anything on that front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| because the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| also does not specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| anything on that front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| That is all handled through rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| That is in the Civil Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| Merit Board rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| not in the current ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Then I was just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| mention as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| there is nothing in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| that provides blanket approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| to directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| The decision is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| at the executive secretary's level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| and under the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| the decision would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| at the HR director's level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| The individual directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| of individual employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| have a facilitation role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| They can endorse it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| they can support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| or they can oppose it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| but the decision is made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| by an HR professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| in either instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| under the current law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| and under what the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| is proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| The difference though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| is that the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| separates the decision maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| from the same body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| that would hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| one of those appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| The decision maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| is the executive secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| and if you felt aggrieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| by that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| you would essentially be appealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| to the executive secretary's bosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Whereas in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| if you disagreed with the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| of the HR director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| you would be able to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| that complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| assuming there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| some merit-based issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| to the merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| completely independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| of the HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| There wouldn't be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| organizational relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| Councilwoman Testament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| And then we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| I think I'm clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| as far as sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| the order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| or the chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| of sort of command,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| In both instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| it can still go to the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| versus the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Can the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| go straight to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| civil service board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| without going to the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| I think the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| that would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| is if there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| some merit-based reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| right from the get-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| that would require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| that would make an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| feel compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| to go straight to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| with their complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| The charter allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| There's already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| you know, language in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| that says any employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| can bring any complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| that has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| some personnel action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| on a basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| other than merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| They can bring that to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| As a practical matter, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| I don't think that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| And part B of that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| as Ms. Hatfield was explaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| let's say an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| or feels like they deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| a reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| They take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| to their director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| The director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| concurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| this employee has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| I'd put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| my recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| that employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| to be reclassified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| level one to level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| is it then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| is considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| for that particular employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| that it's then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| turned into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| where other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| can apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Is that how that works now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| the way it works now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| is that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| a reclassification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| is being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| there's an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| for others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| proposed reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| But it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| a competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| that that establishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| what Vicky was explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Vicky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| you're welcome to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| amplify on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| if an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| is being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| for reclassification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| what's that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| ultimately now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| it would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| to the executive secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| and she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| initiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| that she described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| some analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| of whether it's warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| And as part of that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| of determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4315)|

| 1:19:17| My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| To say they're breaking the rules, please, you know, make them stop and then they will and they're an independent board. And then if we want to change the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4758)|
| 1:19:28| Like, let's say, I want to change the rules for how we recruit police officers and let them be able to apply online from California, instead of flying to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4768)|
| 1:19:38| If we wanted to change the rules, it wouldn't just be like, oh, Mayor Kincannon said so, the HR department wrote the rules up, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| We would bring those rule changes to the Civil Service Mayor Board, say, we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| Please review this, let us know if you think it still meets our principles of non-discrimination and merit and all those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| They would review it, and then they would say, yes, this meets the merit protection standards or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| We want you to amend it in this way. And then once it's approved, it's like, now we can test people in California, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4805)|
| 1:20:14| So I think maybe it's a language thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| I mean, the Civil Service Mayor Board still sets the rules, administration administers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| If I wanted to change the rules and had an HR department that would give me suggestions for what our rules changes could be that would make us a more modern, efficient talent recruiter and retainer and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4824)|
| 1:20:38| I couldn't just do that without going through the Civil Service Mayor Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| It was still rule changes would have to go to them for review, or am I understanding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4841)|
| 1:20:48| Mayor, the answer to your question is a little complicated because some of the rules are in one set of rules and some are in the other set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| For those rules, though, that are made by the merit board and that would continue to be made by the merit board, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| You wouldn't have any authority on your own to change those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| So for your recruiting example, recruiting is something that the ordinance leaves with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| So when it comes to deciding what the appropriate procedures are to make sure that all potential recruits have a fair chance at the job, that would be the merit boards to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| If there was something in those rules that you felt were out of step with your objectives, you would take that request to the merit board and they would they would make the change or not because that's something that would stay with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4879)|
| 1:21:31| So what are the kinds of rules that would not be in the purview of the Civil Service Mayor Board under this ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| So broadly speaking, issues involving classification and compensation would move back to HR because that's where when we had a personnel department, the merit board wasn't making those rules at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4900)|
| 1:21:52| It's part of the management function to define what the jobs are and to budget the salaries fundamentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4912)|
| 1:21:59| That's the philosophical basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| And right. But right now, those rules don't go to the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| Anyways, just as Miss Hatfield said, when someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| Twenty five people have submitted requests for reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| There's been twenty five denials, zero appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| I don't think people even know that they have an opportunity to appeal just ends with the civil service staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| So there so there'd be no no difference in that, except instead of ending with a civil service staff, it end with an HR staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4943)|
| 1:22:30| But we could make it more explicit that if someone's unhappy with the outcome of the HR, we could change the thing that Andrew, Roberto and Lauren were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4950)|
| 1:22:43| You know, on page whatever, I think it's section 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| You're exactly right. We could make it better than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| We could make make it so instead of zero appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| There's a more explicit rule. I'm looking on page seven of the ordinance, section 13, the very last line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| This is an issue that I think employees have found to be problematic and council members and me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| So this is to me, this represents the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| There's no decision of the department shall be final without right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| That's sort of the way it is now, except instead of HR, it's civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| Civil service board, civil service staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| But according to civil service board rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| I'm not sure. I don't think it's in the civil service merit board at all. I think it's just staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| But George, I'll let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| So, Mayor, your example is correct right now. For all intents and purposes, the executive secretary's decision is final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| And she makes that decision on the basis of rules that the merit board has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| There's a practical matter. No one is taking an appeal to the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| It's it's the individual executive secretary's decision that controls the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| What the what the ordinance would do is move that decision over to the HR director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| But still, as is already the case today, but is apparently not exercised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| If the HR director's decision was contrary to merit principles, not necessarily just the letter of a rule, but the principle of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5044)|
| 1:24:13| You know, the idea that merit is what controls our personnel actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| The board always has the ability to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| So if someone said I didn't my my classification upgrade was denied because I'm black or because I'm a woman or because my my supervisors doesn't like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5059)|
| 1:24:32| They could appeal to the merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| That would happen under the new ordinance or in theory it could happen now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| It just doesn't. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| So we could change the ordinance language to maybe make that more explicit or just somehow put it in an employee handbook or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| Because I think that's a real concern of employees being able to appeal that if they think it was unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| If the reason is that they're not actually doing that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| And they're just trying to circumvent, you know, they're trying to get a promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| That's a different that's that's not a merit issue. That's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| You're right, Mayor. So the ordinance and the charter are supposed to talk with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| And so that's what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| If it's easier and clearer, though, to to sort of repeat what the charter is already saying in the ordinance, we can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5114)|
| 1:25:23| Thank you. Let me go to council member writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| OK, so I have a question for Miss Hatfield, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| And we've been talking around this and I just want to make sure that it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| So I have an experience with what we keep talking about reclassification and calling it promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| And I understand it why you're calling it that. But I'm not going to talk about a city job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| OK, so if somebody is crossing guard level one and they want to be reclassed to crossing guard level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5153)|
| 1:26:02| I'm making these things up, but, you know, you want to get bumped up in class because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| There are certain merits. I'm not looking at your system, so I may be speaking off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| But there's certain job functions that you do as level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| And if you do certain job functions, you're level two and there's a pay range associated with level one and there's a pay range associated with level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5180)|
| 1:26:29| If your job changes and you're doing things that you believe puts you at level two, you or your supervisor might say, I'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5189)|
| 1:26:41| I'd like to be reviewed for reclassification because I believe that the functions I'm performing are actually in keeping with level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5201)|
| 1:26:51| So I just wanted to make it clear or have you clarify that people this isn't just people saying I've been here for a certain amount of time, I feel like I deserve a promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5211)|
| 1:27:04| It's does the amount of time and percentages that you spend doing a certain thing put you in level two versus level one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5224)|
| 1:27:14| I've had this personally happen where I had an assistant that I felt was doing supervisory functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| And so when we did an evaluation of the position, a reevaluation on a on a reoccurring basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| I made a point as the supervisor of writing up and saying this person is doing these things which I would like a review for to see if that bumps them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5249)|
| 1:27:39| That is how this that's what a reclassification is, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| That sounds like a pretty good explanation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| A layman's explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Typically, if one is going to be approved, that's what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| I would like to note that in our rules, in the Civil Service Merit Board rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| one of the things that it's very specific about is that in the determination of a reclassification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| it's the intent of our rules to provide guidance and guidelines for monitoring these to ensure that merit principles are not circumvented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5286)|
| 1:28:16| The basis of the reclassification must be gradual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| It can't be a sudden change in a job basically just to circumvent the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| So, yes, we we use the terms interchangeably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| We refer to these we have always referred to these as non-competitive promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| That's why I use the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| OK, because you don't get reclassified laterally and you don't get reclassified down in a promotion in in our system is defined as an accretion and pay grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5316)|
| 1:28:49| But to note that, you know, to meet that meet that test, one of the requirements that we have always required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5329)|
| 1:28:57| And this was something that we agreed on in cooperation with the finance department some 15 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| is that two things, three things have to be met for a subsequent classification to advance to another classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5345)|
| 1:29:16| Time in class cannot currently under our rules, time in class cannot warrant a promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| It has to be a combination of time in class. There have to be additional educational and training requirements added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| We're not just going to have a, you know, a tenure based promotion system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| So it also we have to bring added value through education and training and certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| They have to meet that as well. And there has to be an accretion of duties and responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| So all of those are currently housed and governed by the civil service rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| And we require all of those things prior to someone advancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| OK, so follow up question to that. You use the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5394)|
| 1:30:02| Don't just come up with these rules. Do you have some kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| Is there an overseeing body? Is there a national organization? What monitors what your rules are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5409)|
| 1:30:17| How? I don't understand. Well, yes, I can tell you is most of these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| So we had a body of rules when I came here. So I can't tell you where the original set of civil service rules came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5425)|
| 1:30:35| But time we make a new rule or we make an amendment to a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| You know, I I basically the board typically looks to me for that guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| And I've been an H.R. professional for 23 years. I have a tremendous amount of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5448)|
| 1:30:56| We work with M-TAS very closely. We work with the Tennessee Personnel Management Association very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5456)|
| 1:31:04| We coordinate closely with agencies like Wimberly Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| So we reach to all of those resources and just looking at best practices, best H.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| practices to ensure that our rules, you know, meet our needs, preserve our merit system principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| but also are consistent with H.R. practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| OK. Do we have any other council questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5489)|
| 1:31:39| Councilman Roberto, then we'll go. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| I think we're hitting on the big points here that, you know, I think need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5504)|
| 1:31:50| One being this, you know, Section 11, which is about the rulemaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| And I think, again, if I understand George's answer to my question correctly and given using the mayor's example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5514)|
| 1:32:04| you know, you have compensation and classification rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| The current system would be that that would be if there were any changes made to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| it would be in a public meeting, publicly noticed. That is not addressed in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| It's part of the rules. And I think the follow up to the ordinance would be the rules and the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| You would be able to specify that, you know, the same procedure that goes on with public notification and a notice or notice would go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5549)|
| 1:32:39| If that's not in this ordinance. So one potential way to deal with that would be to bring the rules with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5559)|
| 1:32:47| And that way everyone can see what the initial rules will be with regard to reclassification and these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| And you don't have to wait to see what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| But I do think it's important to if there are going to be changes to any of the rules to make sure it's publicly noticed and give a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| period, so that if employees find that, you know, find out that something came up and didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5587)|
| 1:33:16| I don't think that's where we want to. I don't think that's the intent of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Now, keeping in mind that the charter provides for extensive investigatory powers of the civil service mayor board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| So even if that did happen in that way, they could investigate it even with subpoena power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| I don't think we want that to be where we're going. So I would, again, you know, part of the discussion today is about improvements that we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| Maybe bringing the rules with the ordinance is a good idea. So I don't know, George, did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5622)|
| 1:33:50| You got that right. That's exactly right. That's addressed at a lower level of law right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| It's not addressed in the ordinance. It's addressed in rules. And your analysis is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| OK. I had a couple of questions and I'm happy to let Councilperson Smith go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5641)|
| 1:34:10| But I had a couple of questions for some of the representatives from some of the employment associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5650)|
| 1:34:18| I don't know. Vice Mayor, do you want me to do that after Mr. Smith's question or do you want me to go ahead and do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| If you don't mind, let's let Councilman Smith give his question. Then we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| Ms. Hadfield, I thought I heard you say that the rules themselves being maintained within civil service are part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5670)|
| 1:34:45| Is that what you were saying earlier? No. So the civil service rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| So the charter requires the Civil Service Merit Board to have rules on certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| And our our requirements for notice, 10 day notice, public hearing that comes from the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| Council has currently placed the rules for classification and compensation within the civil service rules through the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5703)|
| 1:35:11| OK, thank you. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| Any other council members? I have a council member, Bardo, if you don't mind, I'd like to let Councilwoman Buickett ask her question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| Absolutely. Thank you, Vice Mayor and Councilman Roberto, because mine goes to follow up that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| So if the rules are made by the Civil Service Board, the Civil Service Board can change the rules. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5732)|
| 1:35:41| So they could publicly notice and change the rules at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| That's correct. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| Councilman Roberto. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'll start with with Kevin Faddis with the Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5752)|
| 1:36:02| Actually, I'm going to ask each of you the same question. So, Kevin, you get you get to be the first the first one to have to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5762)|
| 1:36:12| The hot seat. Is that what we're going to call it? The hot seat? Yes, that's what we'll call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| Hey, given your experience, what I want to ask you about is, you know, can you talk to us about your experience with the present, the current system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5778)|
| 1:36:28| And then after you talk about that experience, can you tell us about things that you might want to see changes in the future or, you know, what the process in your mind would look like in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5788)|
| 1:36:42| Sure. I appreciate it. My name is Kevin Faddis, Knoxville Firefighters Association president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5802)|
| 1:36:49| So thank you for having me on there. First of all, I want to say I completely like this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| Things that you hit on, Councilman Roberto, things that you hit on, Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| And, you know, you guys have really and even Ms. Hatfield, the mayor, I can see where this is being hashed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| And I certainly enjoy this and looking forward to it. But some of the things that I've experienced, you know, it's almost like I want to say a redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5830)|
| 1:37:20| But it's some of the things that I do like about the civil service in itself is the protections of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| Absolutely. First and foremost. And while we were discussing this, you know, some of the language that Mr. Shields put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5847)|
| 1:37:35| Well, Mr. Roberto put forth that Mr. Shields concurred with. I think those are going to put some of our employees at ease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5855)|
| 1:37:44| So thank you for bringing that up. You know, employee protections in the way they dole out discipline from that end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5864)|
| 1:37:54| You know, I think that is a pertinent role of the civil service and or the merit board, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5874)|
| 1:38:02| Some of the things that we've had issues with, of course, are I don't I don't really want to say transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| but it's kind of like that because we don't absolutely know, I think, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| And maybe part of the reason is we didn't ask, but I had no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| We had no idea how much control that the civil service merit board actually has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| We thought some of these things fell on the executive secretary, which some of it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| Absolutely. But I mean, you know, so what we do like, what we do like, what we would like to see is like the comp, the compensation go to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5910)|
| 1:38:44| HR can monitor that on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, on a monthly basis, follow the trends, see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5924)|
| 1:38:55| I don't think and it's nothing against the civil service employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| I don't think it's something that they can actually efficiently do every day, every week, every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5939)|
| 1:39:07| I don't know that they're doing. So the HR function of that, I think, is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| Very good for the city. Very good for civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| It's a checks and balances. And that's what I've been hearing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| I know some of the language is kind of off, but I think we can get there. I truly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5961)|
| 1:39:30| So those are just some of the issues that I've had to pay compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| You know, I did have a question, though. Is it always made public, for instance, that that Councilwoman Ryder brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| Is it always made public for the executive secretary to make a decision on one individual, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5982)|
| 1:39:50| Let's say you had Cabana Boy one, wanted to go to Cabana Boy two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Is that one individual, is that always made public or is that something since there isn't a competition, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=5995)|
| 1:40:03| Is that something just made within the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| So I hope I answered your questions kind of the best I can. I'm still here if you got any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6007)|
| 1:40:16| George, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| I'll be glad to. According to the Merit Board's rules, the posting of a reclassification announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| in other words, the public component of that process occurs after the reclassification decision has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6026)|
| 1:40:33| So it's sort of a final step before it becomes a locked in classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| There's one last chance to make sure there's not some issue that others would be able to bring to the attention of the executive secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| The analysis and for all intents and purposes, the decision is done barring some new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6047)|
| 1:40:54| So if the decision is not going to result in a reclassification, there would not be an announcement that it was even being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| It's only if there is going to be a reclassification and there's one last chance for contrary information to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6061)|
| 1:41:13| Kevin, I know you're probably signed up for a public forum, so I just wanted to hear from you about your thoughts on that and we can save further comment going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6073)|
| 1:41:23| If it's OK, I'd like to ask Ben Buckner the same set of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| He's with the City Employee Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Ben, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Can you follow up on what Mr. Faddis talked to us about with regard to your experience with the current process and what you'd like to see going forward with whatever process we might adopt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6096)|
| 1:41:50| I think the process we would like to adopt is just clarification on employee protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| That's the biggest thing I keep hearing from a lot of people is to make sure we are protected under civil service and where we can't just be reclassed for no reasons and for any particular like political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6116)|
| 1:42:11| You'll hear that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| And then I know Keith Lyon isn't available with the FOP, so Mark Taylor, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6139)|
| 1:42:30| Are you there, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| Mark, if you would raise your hand, if you're dialing in, you could select star 9 to let us know that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6153)|
| 1:42:41| I don't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6161)|
| 1:42:49| Nobody's raising their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Well, he may not have been able to dial in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| That's all I have, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Councilwoman Testimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| So I've heard two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Just to clarify, I've heard from Ms. Hatfield that reclassification is synonymous with promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| But from what Mr. Buckner just said, that the fear of the employees is that reclassification almost also must signify to some level demotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6191)|
| 1:43:23| So I'm just trying to make sure I understand really what the terminology of reclassification is across the board or what everyone's interpretation is of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6203)|
| 1:43:43| I'll be glad to speak to that, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| Our charter is very clear that demotion is the result of a disciplinary action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| It can't be accomplished other than through a disciplinary process that requires notice and an opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| It could not be done, so to speak, through the back door through a classification issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| It's solely a disciplinary matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| Mark Taylor is now here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Well, he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Yeah, he is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| We want to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Mark, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6259)|
| 1:44:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| I think I was muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| Well, I don't know if you had been tuning in, but I had just asked some questions of Kevin Faddis and Ben Buckner, and I'm going to ask you the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6271)|
| 1:44:40| Can you talk to us about your experience with the current process and any changes or what you'd like to see in a future process that we might adopt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6280)|
| 1:44:50| Well, my name is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| I'm the immediate past president of the Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Lodge 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| I was the president for about an eight-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| So I have a bit of experience with the process, with civil service, with compensation, stuff like that, and with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6303)|
| 1:45:14| And I guess, you know, I am a proponent of civil service, and I've used civil service processes as ways to try and resolve conflicts over the years on multiple occasions to varying degrees of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6314)|
| 1:45:33| So I would, first off, want to do nothing that would take away an employee's rights to any equity processes or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6333)|
| 1:45:46| But I think specifically in my line of work and in police, that there are big issues with the current system as far as its ability to adapt and its inflexibility to meet the needs of recruiting and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6346)|
| 1:46:07| and just those things that we need to get back to where we have the proper staffing and to where we can function again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6367)|
| 1:46:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| Okay. Are there any other questions or comments from Council at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| Okay. If not, I have a couple. Okay. Councilwoman Ryder, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| Do you have questions? Because I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| I have a couple, so I'll let you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| Okay. Well, I just wanted to ask. So, Ms. Hatfield, for everyone on Council, I have no idea who from Council was able to watch the Civil Service Merit Board meeting yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6409)|
| 1:47:03| If you were not, I hope that you got the link, and if not, Ms. Hatfield will provide that. I think that was important for everyone to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6423)|
| 1:47:12| I watched it twice. And Ms. Hatfield, when will your next Civil Service Merit Board meeting be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| We actually do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| Isn't it regularly prescribed in your rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| Normally, yeah, the normally scheduled meeting would be on May 13th, but we think we're going to have to call an earlier meeting, so we're discussing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6445)|
| 1:47:37| So, we have not made a decision on that yet. But if it's our regular date, it would be May 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Ms. Hatfield, would you like to, do you have anything else that you'd like to share based on what you've heard to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| I have so many things to say, but I'm going to hold most of them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| I just wanted to do a couple of follow-up comments to some of the statements that were brought to you by the employee reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6477)|
| 1:48:09| George is correct that a reclassification, as defined in our rules, would not include a reduction in classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6489)|
| 1:48:19| I don't see how, under any circumstances, that could be done without being considered a disciplinary demotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6499)|
| 1:48:28| So, I think that answers Ben's concern with regard to a reclassification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| With regard to both Kevin and Mark's comments about compensation and recruiting and retention, I'm just going to direct all of you to the data that I provided you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6515)|
| 1:48:49| I think you have that. I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| It's important to note, I think there's a huge misunderstanding about what we do and how much we do, how many metrics we pull on a regular basis, how many of those we study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6533)|
| 1:49:04| The reports we generate, the reports we share, have shared with our mayors on a quarterly basis, an annual basis with departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6544)|
| 1:49:13| I actually pulled one on my own initiative for Chief Thomas just back in January to show her how we ended up where we were in that situation with having a difficulty recruiting for those academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6553)|
| 1:49:28| and what things she and I have already done to improve that, and you can look at that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| There was a compelling reason why between 2014 and 2016 that situation occurred, and you can see that through really aggressive means, we're already reversing that trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6576)|
| 1:49:47| We are almost back to being able to fill the requisition number. We're very close with this April group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| So, to suggest that we don't do that, I just want to clarify that we absolutely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| We have a lot of trained professionals with regard to compensation, but I did give you all that recruitment and retention data so that you can see that is something we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6603)|
| 1:50:11| We monitor compensation on a regular basis, even in years that we're not doing a survey, so I'm happy to provide any of that at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6611)|
| 1:50:21| So, can I ask Vickie about a question about compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6621)|
| 1:50:32| So, you guys do a compensation study, some of that is in ordinances because we voted on changes to the frequency of information from other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6632)|
| 1:50:47| and that's how the pay ranges are come up with for different classifications of positions. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6647)|
| 1:50:55| Yes. So, until two years ago, we actually did a survey every single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6655)|
| 1:51:03| That is unusual for a municipality, but because of that, we've become extremely well-versed in it and very experienced in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6663)|
| 1:51:12| So, we've done a large number of surveys. We've done two comprehensive surveys with consulting firms, including the Mercer Compensation Study and the Siegel Compensation Study in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6672)|
| 1:51:26| And I have recommended on more than one occasion that because we're doing that, we've done those every six years, that because 2020 is a survey year, it would make sense to potentially look at doing another consultant survey this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6686)|
| 1:51:41| I know that police and fire have raised questions about compression that would give us an opportunity to see if that compression actually exists and what could be done to alleviate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6701)|
| 1:51:53| They've expressed a desire to go back to a step structure that would also address that and allow us to redesign a step structure for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6713)|
| 1:52:01| And just take a checker pulse and look at our market rates. But I guess to me, you're just taking it from one entity and putting it with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6721)|
| 1:52:10| I don't see that you're going to be – you're not going to be gaining something you don't already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| We already do that, and we do it in a very professional manner, and we have a lot of education and experience at doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6735)|
| 1:52:22| So, my question – let me see if I can get – convey to you what my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6742)|
| 1:52:29| Salaries aren't arbitrarily decided. They're based on market data and surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| And you provide that as a recommendation. I know I've been on council a couple of years. That comes to us, but it also goes to the administration. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6755)|
| 1:52:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| And what happens at that point with – it's a recommendation from you. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| So, here's how that process works. And I will respectfully disagree with George in that there is a classification plan and a compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6773)|
| 1:53:04| In the HR profession, you have a class listing, and that's going to list – that's going to house your job classifications and those specifications and descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6784)|
| 1:53:14| You're also going to have a salary structure. The combination of those two things is your class comp plan. It is one plan, and they do work like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6794)|
| 1:53:23| That's what we bring to council. Job classifications don't come to council. That would wear you out if we had to bring those every time we changed or amended a new job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6803)|
| 1:53:34| What comes to council is the class comp plan, which is a single plan, and it's where you intermarry all of your job classifications with your three salary structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6814)|
| 1:53:45| The way that we monitor that and make amendments to that, we do collect data. Even in years we don't do a comprehensive survey, we're always collecting data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6825)|
| 1:53:54| Right now, I'm actually doing a targeted survey for traffic engineering. They want to do a comprehensive reorganization of their parking meter, sign shop, and signal shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6834)|
| 1:54:05| So, we're actually working with them right now to do a targeted classification compensation survey to look at how best to help them reorganize and develop better career paths for those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6845)|
| 1:54:16| So, we do that regularly. When we do a comprehensive survey that looks at all three structures, general government, police, and fire, at the conclusion of that process, so we conduct our own survey or we hire a consultant to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6856)|
| 1:54:30| In the years we've hired a consultant, I work closely with the consultant. We basically do the survey together, and they don't just do a survey and hand us a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6870)|
| 1:54:40| Even in those years, we're working with them on every single step. We help them design the survey. We help them look at the data. We work on every piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6880)|
| 1:54:50| So, when we finish that process, I then look at it initially for recommendations under the classification compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6890)|
| 1:54:59| Do our structures themselves need upward adjustments to better reflect market rates? Do individual job classes need to be readjusted? Do they need to be in a different pay grade? Do they need a better job title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6899)|
| 1:55:12| That's why I say it's a class comp plan. The whole thing works as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| Once I take a look at that and determine some initial recommendations based on my experience doing those, I then sit down with the finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6916)|
| 1:55:27| That's usually step one because I want to say, here's what it looks like we need to do, and this is what we've done. I've been doing this for the city for 15 years, this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6927)|
| 1:55:38| Every year, I sit down with the finance director, usually in February. I go through what, based on the data, look like the ideal recommendations. If we could have our wish list, here's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6938)|
| 1:55:51| Then the finance director and I work on those together to ensure that they're going to be agreeable with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| Sometimes it's something that our wish list, we simply can't afford to do it. We look at that together at that point and work on a final set of recommendations that meet our best needs, most important needs, and still come in with responsible budget considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6958)|
| 1:56:15| Once the finance director and I have something that we both feel meets the class comp needs and the budget needs, we establish a meeting with the mayor. We sit down and propose our joint recommendations to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6975)|
| 1:56:30| In past years, usually it's a couple of meetings to ensure that the mayor has any data that she needs, understands the recommendations, has an opportunity to ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=6990)|
| 1:56:44| It's always been a very cooperative, collaborative process. Once the mayor has had an opportunity to understand, review the recommendations, in my 15 years, I've only had one instance where the mayor wanted different recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7004)|
| 1:57:01| That was last year with the 7.7% increase for police. That was the only time in my tenure we have not arrived at a general consensus. That was just a last minute change that was inserted into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7021)|
| 1:57:18| Usually it's a collaborative process. We all are in agreement before that ordinance is even drafted and goes forward. But it is at the mayor's prerogative to add to those recommendations if the mayor feels there's something that is a priority or she wants to add an increase across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7038)|
| 1:57:39| Certainly, the mayor then can ask me to add those into the class comp ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| Okay, thanks. So you bring a recommendation and you come to a consensus. It's not something that you come to within the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7065)|
| 1:57:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| Mr. Shields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just wanted to correct. It may be Civil Service's practice to treat classification as compensation as though they are too intertwined to be thought of as separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7082)|
| 1:58:14| But that's not what our charter says. Our charter treats them as separate. And that's important because, again, going back to when we had a personnel department and we had a Civil Service Merit Board, all under this charter that we're operating under now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7094)|
| 1:58:28| it was recognized that compensation was the function of the personnel department and the mayor and finance alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7108)|
| 1:58:36| But classification was different because that does impact, you know, the fairness of the task you're assigned to do and the nature of your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7116)|
| 1:58:44| And so it was recognized then that the Merit Board had a role in monitoring classification to make sure that those merit system principles were being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| Compensation is a budget process, and that's why the personnel department managed that process when we formally had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| Classification is a management process first, unless it's being done unfairly in some way. And that's why the Civil Service Merit Board can monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7138)|
| 1:59:06| That's why our charter treats them as separate, because all of the rights and issues that flow from them are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7146)|
| 1:59:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7162)|
| 1:59:33| I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was on mute. I was asking, are there any additional. Thank you, Mr. Shields. Are there any additional questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7173)|
| 1:59:42| Okay, I'll go into my, to my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Ms. Parker had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| I just, I just wanted to comment that it's clear from tonight's discussion that there are a lot of pieces for us to understand before voting on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7189)|
| 2:00:06| And that includes even legislative history going back 40 years, which there doesn't seem to even be agreement on that history and why these changes were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7206)|
| 2:00:19| You know, I'm concerned that we're going to need more time to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| I know many folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| We're all aware that there are many city employees who want to be a part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| And I imagine many more employees who would have signed up for public forum, so that we could better understand their concerns, if we had a different setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7234)|
| 2:00:48| And it was really concerning to me yesterday during the Civil Service Merit Board meeting that, you know, a member of the board with 30 years of HR experience was himself overwhelmed with all of the information coming in on a daily basis, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7248)|
| 2:01:09| And so not able to provide an opinion on this proposed ordinance during yesterday's meeting. So someone with 30 years of HR experience needs more time to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7269)|
| 2:01:24| And I think we as a city council need more time. And certainly, city employees, you know, deserve time and space to give feedback and input on this process, which is different than individual calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7284)|
| 2:01:41| It's different having a one-on-one conversation with the city employee versus us as a group hearing that feedback. So we're all hearing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7301)|
| 2:01:52| So, you know, I don't know where we go from here. We have the workshop today. And then our next conversation on this is not for six, seven weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7312)|
| 2:02:06| And we're not going to hear from the Civil Service Merit Board as a body until that voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7326)|
| 2:02:13| So my hope would be that we would be able to hear from the Civil Service Merit Board as a body before being asked to vote on this ordinance in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7333)|
| 2:02:24| Thank you, Council Member Parker. And we can certainly look at scheduling some time, maybe an additional workshop with council, if we can find availability to actually hear from the Civil Service Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7344)|
| 2:02:44| I have a couple of questions and comments that I'd like to make. At this point, I would like to ask, what has the communication plan been to the employees related to the changes that we're talking about in acting and establishing an HR department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7364)|
| 2:03:03| And so, Mayor, I don't know if you or Mr. Shields can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| Well, I'll speak to that. And maybe if Mr. Shields has something to add, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| The communication has been with in-person meetings. And then since the pandemic, it's been these kinds of meetings, Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7394)|
| 2:03:26| I've had a couple of those. I wanted to hear from council members at this workshop before scheduling the one. I'm planning to have at least three more, one for police, one for fire, and one for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7406)|
| 2:03:40| Because while some of their concerns are just consistent, some of them might be particular to their area of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7420)|
| 2:03:49| So those are going to be planned in the coming weeks. And I do appreciate your willingness to postpone this at the last council meeting. And I think that was a good call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7429)|
| 2:04:02| I think that council members have had some questions answered tonight. Civil Service members had a good discussion yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7442)|
| 2:04:11| But they have time to meet again. They meet again in May. And they can have this on their agenda if that's what they choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7451)|
| 2:04:19| And then they can bring any feedback that they want to to city council at one of your meetings and all before you vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7459)|
| 2:04:32| So yeah, that's my communications plan. I mean, I've been sending some emails and Mr. Hatfield has sent a few emails as well and shared FAQs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7472)|
| 2:04:44| I've answered questions personally, questions by email and phone. But the broader communications plan is to have more of these Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7484)|
| 2:04:56| I would do more in-person ones, but that's just not possible right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| Okay, I totally understand that. And so in those meetings, do we have Civil Service, anyone from the Civil Service Merit Board or Civil Service that maybe sits in on those meetings to address any questions or to maybe help employees feel like this is more cohesive as far as the transition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7501)|
| 2:05:21| Yeah, well, what I pledge to do is to have the meetings and have them be open to the public. And I'll make sure members of the Civil Service Merit Board are aware of when those are. They're not secret meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7521)|
| 2:05:34| And I'll work with our IT people and communications people to do it sort of like whatever we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7534)|
| 2:05:42| I want to set it at a time that's first and foremost convenient for employees, but then invite the media, invite the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7542)|
| 2:05:49| You know, it'll be public similar to what we're doing with this meeting now. So people, I guess we're watching live on YouTube. It can be recorded and posted to the city website, but also people can watch it while it's happening as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7549)|
| 2:06:03| OK, thanks. Thank you. Also, Mayor, you mentioned in your opening statements that employees have questioned the integrity of civil service in the past. Have you seen that in your administration? Are you speaking to past administrations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7563)|
| 2:06:26| Mayor, you're on mute. Mayor, you're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| I'm sorry. I'm just looking back at what I said, and maybe I misspoke. What I meant to say is that it's critical to protect the integrity of the crucial civil service function, not that people question the integrity of the civil service itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7592)|
| 2:06:48| If I said that, I apologize. I misspoke. I do not have any experience of that. I think people in general think the civil service does a good job, and it's just difficult to wear two hats, and that's what the challenge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7608)|
| 2:07:05| OK. And then also you had mentioned that there's been some due diligence that was done across the state with other municipalities regarding civil service versus HR departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7625)|
| 2:07:20| The feedback, were you able to get any additional feedback as to how long they've been in place, background, how long have those been in place, what's been the feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7640)|
| 2:07:35| Well, this was a survey that MTAS did, and they got the responses, like I said, from about 20 or so entities, but I think right now it might be hard to get people to answer more extensive questions about the history of it and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7655)|
| 2:07:52| So I can ask MTAS if they could send that survey, but if they're anything at all like how busy we are, it's not going to be. I'm not expecting a high response rate, but I can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7672)|
| 2:08:05| And I mean, I think what's important to note is that we are really, what's unique about us is that we do have civil service. We do have merit protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7685)|
| 2:08:14| And that's something that's unique, almost unique to NYSL. There's only two other cities that have that. And I think that's something that's really important. It helps us be a strong employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7694)|
| 2:08:24| It helps us protect from discrimination. In other cities, a mayor could be elected and just fire people who had a yard sign for their opponent in their yard. We can't do that here, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7704)|
| 2:08:39| I think patronage is bad. Nepotism is bad. Hiring people and firing and promoting for anything other than merit is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7719)|
| 2:08:49| And I think that that's exactly why we have the civil service protections, and that's why I don't want to change that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7729)|
| 2:08:56| But I think, as I said at the beginning, our employees need more than just protection, the merit protections. They also need those HR functions, the recruitment, the retention, the training for our managers and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7736)|
| 2:09:11| So I want to keep civil service and all those protections and strengthen the HR side of things and have them be two separate functions because one sets the rules and the other administers the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7751)|
| 2:09:27| And we need the civil service to act as that watchdog to make sure not just my administration, but all subsequent administrations follow those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7767)|
| 2:09:35| Can we clarify, though, that under this ordinance for compensation and classification, the HR department would set the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7775)|
| 2:09:48| Mr. Shields, can you clarify that for me, for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| Yes. So under this ordinance, those rules would return to the administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7794)|
| 2:10:02| They would not be made to the civil service rules because they're only now being made there because there's no personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7802)|
| 2:10:08| But even then, civil service has an overarching authority, even if they're not making the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7808)|
| 2:10:15| They have an authority to hear complaints, conduct investigations and order remedies on any violation of merit system principles, regardless of who the author of the rules is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7815)|
| 2:10:24| And that part could not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| But we cannot say that civil service merit board makes the rules and then another department is administering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7827)|
| 2:10:36| Councilwoman Parker, it's my understanding, and Mr. Shields, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| I mean, he just stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| Okay. That civil service would continue to make all the rules about merit protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| And right now, the classification and compensation rules are not really made by civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| It's just made by the executive secretary and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| And it ends there. It doesn't go to the board for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| And now it would go to HR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| But like I said, since there's so many concerns and I share them about an appeal process and what the charge allows, we can put in the ordinance that fix that thing on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7866)|
| 2:11:20| I think it was where we can clarify in there that people that could appeal, if they feel like they've been discriminated against, they could appeal to the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7880)|
| 2:11:30| They could appeal through the merit system to the civil service merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| Okay. That's as clear as I think I know how to make it this evening anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| Let me go ahead, Mr. Shields, and I have a question, a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7901)|
| 2:11:46| I was just going to try and clarify that. The merit board's rules are doing two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| Some of those rules are merit protections, but a lot of them are the day-to-day processing of a request or the handling of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| You know, it's setting out the steps, if you will, that a particular issue is handled through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| The part that changes is the administrative part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| You know, the who and the how and the when type stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| The merit protection part is something civil service can always make rules on because that's their core charter function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7931)|
| 2:12:19| So even if the administrating rules are being done separately, civil service could still maintain rules that address inequities in how that administration is being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7939)|
| 2:12:30| You know, if there's some non-meritorious aspect of that, they can make rules designed to remedy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7950)|
| 2:12:37| It's a distinction between who's doing it on a day-to-day basis and who's monitoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| And the rules would have a different focus if they were split between those two separate groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| Okay. So let me ask the clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| Ms. Hatfield, you may be more appropriate to answer this one because I keep hearing reference to the Executive Secretary and just recently the Executive Secretary and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7973)|
| 2:13:05| Are we talking about, is her staff the Civil Service Merit Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| Vicki Hatfield's official job title is Executive Secretary to the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7990)|
| 2:13:19| The Civil Service Merit Board are five volunteers who they are, essentially they direct, they're the board that directs Ms. Hatfield in her capacity as Executive Secretary for, you know, whatever direction that she needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=7999)|
| 2:13:38| And then Civil Service has staff members, I don't know how many, 12 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| I'm not sure exactly how many, I'm sure Ms. Hatfield can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| And they are City of Knoxville civil service protected employees, many of whom do civil service functions, some of them whose job titles are, you know, they do HR functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8028)|
| 2:13:59| So that's what, those are the paid staff who process, some of them are the ones who do the work of the old personnel department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8039)|
| 2:14:13| Say, for example, when someone wants a classification, that doesn't go to the board, that goes to the civil service staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8053)|
| 2:14:21| And they review it and apparently, you know, typically deny it for the reasons Ms. Hatfield explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| And then it ends there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| So when I say civil service staff, I mean actual employees of the City of Knoxville who work in the civil service department, and their boss is Vicki Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8070)|
| 2:14:39| And Vicki Hatfield's boss is the members of, the volunteer members of the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Ms. Hatfield, do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| Or answer how many staff members you currently have, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things that were a little misspoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8093)|
| 2:15:00| My official title is the Civil Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| That's actually what is in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| That's what's in the class listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| I serve as the Executive Secretary to the Civil Service Merit Board, but that job title does not actually exist in our class listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8107)|
| 2:15:14| I do work for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| I report to the board of five members, and all of the actions that I take are subject to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8117)|
| 2:15:23| I do have a staff of currently 11 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| And one thing that the mayor said that, I don't know if she meant it this way, but it came out a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| She stated that currently the rules are not subject to the board and that they're made by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8135)|
| 2:15:43| And that is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| I think what she meant to say, I think she was just referring to the reclassification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| And all of our rules, all of the civil service rules are subject to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8149)|
| 2:15:55| I don't have authority over the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-200416?start=8155)|
