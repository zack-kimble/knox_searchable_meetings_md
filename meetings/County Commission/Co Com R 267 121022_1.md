| 2:29:26| But then we would have to also not only have those people screen the vehicles on Hill Avenue at the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8966)|
| 2:29:33| but you would have to have metal detectors and screeners at both ends of the main floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8973)|
| 2:29:40| Normally at rush hour, at least, that would consist of two PBA security personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| plus one sheriff's personnel at each end of the floor, so that's six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| And those people plus the screeners on Hill have to be there not only during the normal operational hours of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8993)|
| 2:30:01| they have to be there as late as you might meet or as late as the city council might meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| so obviously we can't perfectly predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| But the cost assumptions we made, I think it was around $450,000 for those ongoing personnel costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9010)|
| 2:30:20| That also included a parking attendant, which has to be there to collect money on the outbound side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9020)|
| 2:30:27| But the main thing I want to mention was people come to Boomsday and football games over the course of a number of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9027)|
| 2:30:34| I mean, it goes usually a five-, six-hour window that we've got traffic coming in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| People come to work within an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| We're going to back Hill Avenue up to the Basketball Hall of Fame and past Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| if we start screening vehicles at peak rush hour every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| I mean, it's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| It's a logistical nightmare from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9056)|
| 2:31:03| The other thing about it is in order to allow the public into the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| you've got to kick out 100 of your people and the city's got to kick out 50 of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| Boy, I don't want to be the guy building that list, and I don't know that you do either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| And some of you might be on that list, which you've got people parking at Kessel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| and you've got some of you parking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| Those are just practical issues that arise when you say something that sounds popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| sounds like a good thing, but there are many, many moving parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| And, frankly, Commissioner Smith was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| Commissioner Smith was adamantly in favor of reopening this garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| And after listening to about three meetings of that stuff and all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9107)|
| 2:31:54| I think at least acknowledged that it was a lot more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9114)|
| 2:31:59| and a lot more problematic than you might think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| So I'm going to stop there, and I'll be glad to, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| go into detail with anybody individually or answer any questions you might have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| Any other questions for Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| Thanks, Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| Okay, we have the motion to defer for 30 in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9140)|

| 2:32:40| Resolution 903 is approving a grant contract in the amount of $425,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9160)|

| 2:33:17| Can we take about a ten-minute break before we get to the passage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9197)|
| 2:33:21| We've just got a couple of items, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9201)|

| 2:33:28| Can you wait just a few minutes, Mr. Moran?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| We'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| We also have green space, but we'll be here at five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| Okay, let's take ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| We'll come back at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| Is that adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| Okay, commissioners, let's go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9225)|

| 2:33:52| The next item is Resolution 114, which was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| It's designating the Knox County Commission's representative on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9236)|

| 2:34:13| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9254)|

| 2:34:25| the Knox County Commission Chairman's appointments to the Cable TV Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| Any of those appointments, McKenzie, Broyles, Owen, B. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| Anders, Smith, Wright, Brown, and Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| Okay, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Okay, we're on Page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| It's Ordinance O-12-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| It's to amend the Knox County Code, Chapter 12, Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| entitled Peddlers and Solicitors, to further regulate transient vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9301)|
| 2:35:05| and enable the Knox County Department of Code's administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| and inspections to enforce said regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| This amends Ordinance O-97-5-101, adopted July 28, 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9311)|
| 2:35:17| and O-10-6-101, adopted July 26, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9328)|
| 2:35:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| I would like you all to consider the fact that I think this particular ordinance is too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9338)|
| 2:35:50| We have a lot of folks in our community, a lot of them are retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9350)|
| 2:35:56| who operate under the free enterprise system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9356)|
| 2:36:01| They may be drawing Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| Maybe they're on partial disability or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| They're in the garden and they grow some produce to go out to one of the local hot spots, intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9366)|
| 2:36:16| Now, if you're out in deep south Knox County on McCammon Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| you're not going to get a lot of traffic if you stick it out on your front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| But if you go down to the corner of John Sevier and Martin Mill Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9384)|
| 2:36:30| most days you'll find somebody down there with some products to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| They're not blocking traffic in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| I know that's the main issue and they're perpetual offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9399)|
| 2:36:45| But the people that do this on a seldom basis, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9405)|
| 2:36:53| we're going against the free enterprise system in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9413)|
| 2:36:58| Suppose Dr. Briggs has an overrun of honey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| and nobody wants to run out by his place out there and buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| But he says, well, you know, next Saturday I'm going to take a couple of cases over to Westtown Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9425)|
| 2:37:10| and open up my trunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| Well, he can't do that under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| I think we need to take another look and make some exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| where that some of these folks who are doing this to supplement their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9439)|
| 2:37:24| Right now, you know, they're doing it because times are hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| But a lot of these folks do it, you know, all of the time, whether good times or hard times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| because, number one, they may enjoy gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| If you've ever done any farming or gardening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| you know that, as old boy says, there ain't a lot of money to be made in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| By the time you figure your time in and your machinery and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9465)|
| 2:37:50| your corn will have to be about seven bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| So the fact that they're able to do this and help out, you know, folks in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| I think we'll be penalizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| And I just don't think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| Mr. Brown, if you'll read the ordinance, it takes care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| It excludes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| Roy, if you'll mention to us what it excludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| We specifically kept that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| Roy, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| Roy Braden, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| In the ordinance itself, it excludes agricultural products being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9502)|
| 2:38:27| Also, the Knox County Zoning Ordinance has three yard sales a year permitted for any homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9507)|
| 2:38:34| and two rummage sales for any civic or church institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| So I don't think we would be targeting people that would be setting up on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9519)|
| 2:38:45| roadside stands or anyone selling agricultural products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| So, Mike, that addresses what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9530)|
| 2:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| Mr. Hammond, you had your line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| Did you mean to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| No, agricultural products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9541)|
| 2:39:04| And I was going to go along with Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9544)|
| 2:39:07| I've stopped by a couple of these places on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| And, basically, these are not people who are business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9550)|
| 2:39:14| I mean, they're people who have a few extra tomatoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| or whatever it is from their garden they're just trying to sell to make a few extra bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| Some guy's got a few beehives, and he's just trying to sell some honey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| and he had permission to be on these people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| And so I don't have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| But then I go on down John Sevier, and there's some guy down there who's selling steaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| And he's just got a big elaborate deal set up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| And so, to me, that's a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| So when you say agricultural, can you define that a little more for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| If you're out doing codes and you're going to have to enforce this, how are you going to differentiate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| Well, number one, most of our complaints are lodged by the public, and we work off of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9589)|
| 2:39:58| Other than that, if an inspector goes out and has a complaint on one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9598)|
| 2:40:06| and someone else is in violation, then they would probably write them up next property or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| Someone selling any kind of honey and goods like you're explaining, we probably would not even stop and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9613)|
| 2:40:20| But, anyway, agricultural products, if you were to sell them as a roadside stand, which is allowed in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9620)|
| 2:40:29| if you move that off of property, off of your own property, it might be considered retail sales of other goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9629)|
| 2:40:36| But, as I said, we work off of complaints at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| And I don't think our inspectors would be bothering those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| But if they had permission from the property owner to be there, even though it's not their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| This may allow someone to actually get a permit to sell goods like that if that's what they so chose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9648)|
| 2:40:57| What about the guy with the stakes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| I'm sure you've seen him because he's all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Those people that are selling those products are supposed to be getting a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| or a permit at this time from the clerk because that is something that's being sold as new goods or sold as new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9670)|
| 2:41:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| Roy, kind of talking about the roadside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| We've got one in Powell that's pretty large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| I mean, it's sitting on Clinton Highway between the Emory's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| And it's not currently legal because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| Is it currently legal or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| It could be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| That is a CA zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| At one time they were growing some things at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| The zoning ordinance allows that to be done as a roadside stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| if the goods are grown on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| All the goods have to be gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9718)|
| 2:41:59| They can't bring anything in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9719)|
| 2:42:00| They can bring some things in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| And I would, forgive me, I'd have to read the ordinance again to exactly see what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| Because I've also got right down from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| There's a TVA easement where somebody will set up firewood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| or one guy comes and sets up a fishing rod store there on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| And under this, that would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| It's already illegal because he's on TVA's right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| But as a roadside stand, this would kind of alleviate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| And the man selling the fishing supplies should already have a permit through the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9747)|
| 2:42:34| And he would be regulated for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9754)|
| 2:42:37| And I think that also has to do with business taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| And what about just up the road a little bit on Larry's border here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| but the Old Ingalls are starting to kind of become a flea market there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| Under this ordinance, that would be illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9774)|
| 2:42:55| They would have to get their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| And this would allow people to actually get permits through the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9777)|
| 2:43:03| or licenses, as this ordinance states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| And they get a permit through us, a use permit, so that we can check to see the zone is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| check to see that they have permission from the property owner, and then that way they can be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| And I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9801)|
| 2:43:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9803)|
| 2:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9804)|
| 2:43:25| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| Roy, I assume agriculture, that includes firewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| A guy with the pickup truck load of firewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| I would consider that an agricultural product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| Is the clerk's office or your office who determines that the owner, like you see the guys with the pickup trucks everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9818)|
| 2:43:46| that the owner has given permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| Is that not an arduous process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| Well, the people that would be trying to become legal would have to obtain the license from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9832)|
| 2:43:59| Then they would have to obtain a permit through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| We would check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| We would be probably the only department that would enforce anything through a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9845)|
| 2:44:11| I don't think the clerk's office probably has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| You feel confident, and that wouldn't be too much of a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| I know it's easy to look at KGIS and see who owns a piece of property, but contacting them is another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9860)|
| 2:44:26| And finally, referencing the Westtown Mall and so forth, I mean, how is the city on their more restrictive right now, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9866)|
| 2:44:36| I would believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| I think they do have a permitting process or a license process already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| I know they do for Market Square Mall, and I would think they do for other special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9883)|
| 2:44:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| The clerk's business tax or the license or permit that they require now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| it requires the person applying to give specific dates and specific places for a 14-day permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9895)|
| 2:45:05| And the permit's 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| That was my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9908)|
| 2:45:09| Two weeks only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Our office, by procedure, could require our permits to match up with the clerk's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9911)|
| 2:45:19| And we would do that through a procedure so that people, if they want to get 14-day permits through the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9919)|
| 2:45:25| then we could limit those to 14 or 30 days through our office so that we can maybe try to regulate it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9925)|
| 2:45:33| for those businesses that actually need the license from the clerk's office and a permit through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9933)|
| 2:45:43| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| Roy, what about the guy that makes and sells, as Mr. VandeVate calls them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9945)|
| 2:45:51| bean bag toss games or birdhouses to sell at Christmas or even Christmas wreaths or any other seasonal products?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9951)|
| 2:46:04| What category do they come under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| I would think that they could fall under this ordinance, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| I think those businesses I try to, I guess, illustrate is where companies go into parking lots and set up and sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9972)|
| 2:46:21| Usually that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| I think that they should be regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| They should have to pay their taxes just like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| And this is the way to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| I think the ---- I talked with one of the law ---- Deputy Law Directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| and he explained part of the 14-day permit by the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| It's more of a tax, and it's under state law that they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| So the state's trying to make sure that they get tax money to operate and set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| And what we're trying to do by this ordinance is to make sure that they have proper parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| that they're not selling in the road right away, and safety being the number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10014)|
| 2:47:00| I understand, Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10020)|
| 2:47:01| And I appreciate you and I have discussed this on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10021)|
| 2:47:05| and I appreciate your department's position on basically being complaint driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10025)|
| 2:47:12| and allowing some of these folks to do this so that they can make a couple extra bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10032)|
| 2:47:17| But if they come and get that permit or license, whatever, that's 50 bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| Well, if a guy's made ten birdhouses and he wants to go up there and sell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10040)|
| 2:47:25| that might not be all the profit he'd even get out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| So, I mean, it's, you know, it's kind of becoming a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| I know for a fact that at least three of those that come up to the bilo there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10052)|
| 2:47:40| Martin Mill and John Sevier, they give the profits they make out of it to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10060)|
| 2:47:48| or one of them gives it to admissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| So it's kind of a hobby with some of them, but it's a chance that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| everybody likes to show off their handiwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| But yet there are some who do it for, you know, put a little extra money in their pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10079)|
| 2:48:04| and maybe put bread on the table, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| So it's a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| I just want to be sure that we're going to be able to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| If it gets to the point where we have a lot of complaints on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| and these folks can't do that, then I think we need to revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| We have a motion to approve on first reading this peddlers and slicers ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10107)|
| 2:48:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10113)|

| 2:48:38| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| One pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10122)|

| 2:48:49| It's ordinance O-12-9-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| Since you've had to do this once and Angie's had to do it once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10135)|
| 2:49:01| and in fairness we see another member of your contingent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10141)|
| 2:49:10| So we cleared it with Ms. Sexton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| and she has agreed that she'll read this thing maybe for the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10158)|
| 2:49:19| Go ahead, Ms. Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10159)|

| 2:52:12| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| Thank you, Ms. Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10336)|
| 2:52:20| I think you're equal to your mates here on the clerk's office, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10340)|
| 2:52:26| Thanks also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| And we don't mean to make light of this from the codes administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| We know all the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10350)|
| 2:52:31| Thanks, Roy and Bill, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10351)|
| 2:52:34| So this is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| Do we have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| I'll second, but I just want to say that I know that Roy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| and his group have been working on this for a couple of years to kind of get all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| So I applaud them for finally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| It's a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10370)|
| 2:52:51| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10375)|
| 2:52:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10376)|
| 2:53:01| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10381)|
| 2:53:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10382)|
| 2:53:03| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| We have Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10389)|
| 2:53:10| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| We've got public forum also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10392)|
| 2:53:13| There's possibly someone else here that wanted to speak to the voter ID issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10393)|
| 2:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10400)|
| 2:53:30| Thank you, sir, for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| And please give us your name and your address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| My name is Paul Burney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| I live at 1412 Hannah Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| And, again, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other commissioners for the opportunity to entertain the resolution that we had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10425)|
| 2:53:58| Basically, I just don't know how this became a partisan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10438)|
| 2:54:05| It just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10445)|
| 2:54:10| To me, it just makes sense that you would want to encourage as many people out there to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10450)|
| 2:54:17| I was born and raised here in Knox County, and I attended Knox County Public School Systems, and I've lived here all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10457)|
| 2:54:24| And I can probably say that I had a number of teachers growing up and family members who told me that one of the obligations of being a citizen was to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10464)|
| 2:54:35| And, you know, and as many of you all know up here as elected officials, we the public like to gripe about you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10475)|
| 2:54:46| And I was told you don't have a right to gripe if you don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10486)|
| 2:54:52| So I've always taken voting as something, as an obligation, as something that my granddaddy and my daddy fought for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10492)|
| 2:55:02| and many of your family members probably did as well, for us to have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10502)|
| 2:55:07| And I just feel that the fact that there's never been a case of voter fraud here in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10507)|
| 2:55:18| There's never been anyone convicted of voter fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| And from the year 2000 until 2010, there have been 13 cases of voter fraud here in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10521)|
| 2:55:30| That's throughout the entire United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| There's actually almost 20 cases of toilets exploding in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10534)|
| 2:55:41| We were just listening to various code adoptions and code enforcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10541)|
| 2:55:46| You know, it's silly, but one might presume that the General Assembly might regulate exploding toilets next term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10546)|
| 2:55:55| since that seems to be a more pressing issue than voter fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10555)|
| 2:56:02| This is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10562)|
| 2:56:08| I don't see it as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| It seems that we have a solution looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| There have been several cases in the state of Tennessee of election fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| That's when one of the poll workers tampers with the machine or tampers with someone's votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10579)|
| 2:56:26| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| There have been a number of cases of that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| Voter ID will not stop that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| There's nothing in this law that will prevent election fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10595)|
| 2:56:39| Absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| What it will prevent is poor and elderly from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10601)|
| 2:56:47| There's a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10607)|
| 2:56:48| We were just talking about the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10608)|
| 2:56:53| Many of them don't have a photo ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10613)|
| 2:56:58| The case was brought up earlier that you can't travel outside the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| You have to have a passport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| You have to have a photo ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| Not a lot of elderly people, not a lot of poor people use their passports or travel outside of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10626)|
| 2:57:13| In fact, I've met a number of poor people who don't even have a bank account, who've never had a bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10633)|
| 2:57:25| I just feel like we should be doing everything we can in our power to encourage people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10645)|
| 2:57:31| And this is the reason, one of the reasons why the League of Women Voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| and many other fine organizations here in town have tried to educate people about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10654)|
| 2:57:41| and are, well, opposed to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10661)|
| 2:57:48| I respect your all's individual opinions and beliefs on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10668)|
| 2:57:55| and I thank you for entertaining our resolution that we've asked you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10675)|
| 2:58:02| But, frankly, I feel that as an elected body, as a group that was put here by the citizens of this fine county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10682)|
| 2:58:11| that, well, that you would encourage more of your constituencies to get out, to be active, to be proactive, and to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10691)|
| 2:58:23| I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| Thank you, Mr. Burney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| Mr. Chairman, could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10711)|
| 2:58:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10712)|
| 2:58:33| Mr. Burney, you and your colleagues, what exactly are you asking us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| Is there a resolution before us next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| I guess I'm a little unsure as to what you're asking us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| I know you've talked about a resolution, but there's really nothing on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10722)|
| 2:58:47| So I'm just wondering where do you all want to go with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10727)|
| 2:58:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10732)|
| 2:58:55| It's my understanding that we're in the process of crafting a resolution to get various counties, municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10735)|
| 2:59:06| to support looking at the voter registration or, excuse me, the voter ID law as it exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10746)|
| 2:59:14| and to encourage the General Assembly to rescind that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10754)|
| 2:59:21| So you're working on a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| I'm actually working with some people, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10767)|
| 2:59:28| There's a number of different people here today that are expressing their concerns about this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10768)|
| 2:59:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| Because you had said, I think the other speakers had said, that you wanted us to vote on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| but there's really nothing before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| That's why I was wondering the process that you all were going to be using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10779)|
| 2:59:42| if you're going to be bringing something before us or where we were with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| And my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| I kind of came in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| I missed some of that, some of the speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10796)|
| 2:59:57| Mr. Burney, and for the people that spoke today, you all did a really good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| really enjoyed listening to what you all had to say and you had passion in what you had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| But to be honest with you, we're not the people you need to bring it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10804)|
| 3:00:08| If you want to move your agenda quicker, you take it straight to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| That's what you need to do, see your state representative, your state senators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| and you all get together with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| It will move a lot quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10818)|
| 3:00:19| I mean, you can go through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10819)|
| 3:00:20| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10820)|
| 3:00:21| But they're fixing to head back to Nashville and put their laws into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10821)|
| 3:00:29| And right now is when they're thinking what laws do they want to be passing for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| So the month of November, then December is a great time to be talking to your representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| and your state senators because that's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| If you give us something, it's going to take us a month or two for us to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| And by the time we get down there, it might not be there in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| So I just need to go straight to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| I mean, we are concerned with you and feel the same way that you feel on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10848)|
| 3:00:54| But if you want to move quicker, you need to just go straight to the people that are actually going to pass that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10854)|
| 3:00:59| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| And, actually, that is something that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| There is a we're scheduled to do that next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10863)|
| 3:01:08| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10871)|
| 3:01:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10872)|
| 3:01:13| Thank you, Mr. Burney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| Come ahead, Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10876)|
| 3:01:22| The reason that we approached our local body first, and we do intend, actually, next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10882)|
| 3:01:29| we are delivering the petition to the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| We're asking that Speaker Harwell personally foster the changes because she is a woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10893)|
| 3:01:41| And as a protected class, we believe that she should be, you know, acting in her own self-interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10901)|
| 3:01:48| But we also wanted to gain the support of our local officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| And that is why we had asked that if a resolution were drafted, could we, you know, propose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10912)|
| 3:02:02| And could it be voted upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10925)|
| 3:02:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| Thank you, Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10927)|
| 3:02:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| We have, I believe, one discussion item remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| And Mr. Luthold and Mr. Weaver are here from Property Assessor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10933)|
| 3:02:20| They have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10940)|
| 3:02:26| Mr. Luthold, name and address and tell us all about Greenbelt relative to tax revenues, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10946)|
| 3:02:33| He said he had a black belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| I'm a second degree, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| But I'm Craig Luthold, 1320 Zachary Taylor Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10957)|
| 3:02:44| and I'm Public Information Director for Knox County Property Assessor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| I have Jim Weaver here with me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| He is the Chief Deputy for the Property Assessor and can answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10972)|
| 3:03:00| I think he's going to let me try to answer them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| But he'll make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| I'll just entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| I had asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| I was reading the newspaper article about all the Greenbelt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| and Mr. Ballard was quoted there saying that this was something he was going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| So I was just asking, okay, exactly what is he going to be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| What is the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| When is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11004)|
| 3:03:25| In other words, just kind of brief us on exactly what Mr. Ballard is going to do with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11005)|
| 3:03:30| Well, I know that we plan on, in November, we're going to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| and go through all of our about 1,700 or so parcels of land that are under Greenbelt right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11013)|
| 3:03:44| and we're going to start that process of examining them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11024)|
| 3:03:47| making sure that they're complying with the law as far as how they've applied to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| And we did this two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| and we discovered a few that were no longer using it for those purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| and they were taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| And so, and as you may or may not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| if a piece of property sells or becomes subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| and it no longer meets the requirements for Greenbelt, we do take those off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11048)|
| 3:04:15| And I think over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| I think about 90 or so properties have been taken off for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| I think that's 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| It must be 15 acres for if it's qualifying for agricultural or for the forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11064)|
| 3:04:32| But if it's open space, it could be much less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11072)|
| 3:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| Other questions on Greenbelt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| There were two golf courses that the city had disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11081)|
| 3:04:47| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11087)|
| 3:04:48| The city doesn't have the Greenbelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| The county has the Greenbelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11090)|
| 3:04:51| And there was two golf courses that were on it as open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11091)|
| 3:04:58| that our office was notified by the state that the golf courses do not qualify under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11098)|
| 3:05:06| So they were taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11106)|
| 3:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11107)|
| 3:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11108)|
| 3:05:09| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11109)|
| 3:05:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11113)|
| 3:05:14| Thank you, Mr. Lujan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11114)|
| 3:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11115)|
| 3:05:16| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11116)|
| 3:05:17| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| I'd like to bring up something, and I hope I'm not out of order in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| I want to go back to something in our beer board today, and I've been pondering this and thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11124)|
| 3:05:28| Mr. Law Director, could you review some of the actions that we have taken with regards to increasing those fines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11128)|
| 3:05:35| Somewhere in the back of my mind, we as a body increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| and we were told we could do so under state law, the amount of monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| And I want to say that, well, could you look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11144)|
| 3:05:48| Because I know that we did take a revocation at one point, and we actually revoked someone's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11148)|
| 3:05:55| And would you look into that and find out and just give us clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11155)|
| 3:05:58| Because I think as we move forward, we need to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11158)|
| 3:06:01| So I'm just making that as a request for our next beer board meeting, if you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| During the beer board, I said that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| There is an area of exception, and I'm going to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| And see some people it applies to, some people it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11173)|
| 3:06:19| I do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| And so I'll try to have you some real clarity and some real rules by next beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11181)|
| 3:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11185)|
| 3:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| Any other items from other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11194)|
| 3:06:35| We'll adjourn until five o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11195)|

| 3:07:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| We have ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11227)|
| 3:07:08| Welcome to our zoning portion of our October commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| The first item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| The first item is 9-A-12-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11234)|
| 3:07:17| It's a request of Jack Walker for a northeast county sector plan amendment from NC Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| and AG&RR Agricultural and Rural Residential to RC Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| Properties located northeast side of Tillett Lane, northeast of Corrington Road and the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11247)|
| 3:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| Is Mr. Walker here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| The staff, do we have comments about this, Buzz or Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11260)|
| 3:07:49| I don't think that, yeah, that one's been troublesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| That one's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| This one's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| Yes, sir, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| You have a sector plan amendment, a companion rezoning for property located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| A little bit closer there, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| Located at the northeast side of Tillett Lane, northeast of Corrington Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11289)|
| 3:08:13| It is a request for a plan amendment from NC Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| and Agricultural and Rural Residential to Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| And if you allow me to go ahead and mention the zoning, RB zoning to rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11302)|
| 3:08:31| This is part of a commercial node near the intersection of Corrington Road and the railroad that crosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11311)|
| 3:08:43| There is commercial development, commercial zoning around that interchange of a railroad and the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11323)|
| 3:08:51| This is part of a track that is already being used for commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| or part of a development track already being used for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11335)|
| 3:09:00| You have CA zoning on the neighboring track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11340)|
| 3:09:04| You also have surrounding the property RB general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| The staff, for the most part, looked favorably on the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| We see that rural commercial is appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| It would be needed to allow the rural commercial zoning because of the proposal by the applicant to use it for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11358)|
| 3:09:28| As I say, a good bit of the track is already used, but he wants to do some expansion that leads into a panhandle piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11368)|
| 3:09:38| that comes out of the property, and this is the part we're a little bit concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11378)|
| 3:09:44| If the staff looked at that, and because the rural commercial requires some setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11384)|
| 3:09:51| and landscaping requirements that help to make rural commercial types of development more compatible with the surroundings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11391)|
| 3:10:00| a better neighbor, if you will, the fact that it is adjoining a residential piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11400)|
| 3:10:07| the staff recommended that that panhandle, and you see it on your staff recommendation for the planned amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11407)|
| 3:10:16| and compare it to the actual request, it juts out to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11416)|
| 3:10:21| and borders what you see on your map is 3.02, borders that on the south side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11421)|
| 3:10:27| so it's a small strip roughly, I'd say 75 feet by roughly 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11427)|
| 3:10:36| The staff recommended that that part be left out on the planned amendment and the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11436)|
| 3:10:43| and then the planning commission supported the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11443)|
| 3:10:48| and voted by an almost unanimous vote, we had one abstention, 12-0-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11448)|
| 3:10:56| to support the staff recommendation for a partial rezoning to rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11456)|
| 3:11:01| excuse me, planned amendment to rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| and a partial rezoning to rural commercial from R.B. General Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11464)|
| 3:11:11| Okay, thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11473)|
| 3:11:17| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| I believe we need a little bit of discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| This was a sort of a mismatch of properties assembled by the late Bud Warwick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11487)|
| 3:11:35| and known as Corrington Lumber Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| Well, I think according to our rules, Mr. Wright, we need a motion before we have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11498)|
| 3:11:47| Eventually here I want to make a motion that's going to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| Just get to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11512)|
| 3:11:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11513)|
| 3:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11514)|
| 3:11:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11515)|
| 3:11:56| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11516)|
| 3:11:57| Thank you, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| This property was assembled by Bud Warwick and was known as Corrington Lumber Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| Some zoned commercial and some not, basically because there are two arbitrary, I believe the word used was node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11524)|
| 3:12:17| It's measurements of straight lines, measuring from railroad tracks and street intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11537)|
| 3:12:26| The impact of it is that there is a commercial area in Corrington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11546)|
| 3:12:32| and there is surrounding it an RB zone, which lends itself to 75-foot wide lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11552)|
| 3:12:42| 10,000 square feet of I'll call it acreage, but it's not an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11562)|
| 3:12:47| Normally when you think of East County, all of the residential lots are acre in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| and this is nowhere approaching an acre in size, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11572)|
| 3:12:55| 75 by 300, someone can tell me what part of an acre that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11575)|
| 3:13:02| The growth in this particular parcel of property probably ceased 25 or 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11582)|
| 3:13:10| The use has always been sale of building materials and auto body repair, the entire piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11590)|
| 3:13:19| The current owner, he's been advised that he needs to get his paperwork straightened out, get it fixed, get it surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11599)|
| 3:13:28| get the zoning covering its operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| To this, MPC's agreed on the majority of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11611)|
| 3:13:36| You can see the hash marks in the area that's in the maps of what has been presented to us by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11616)|
| 3:13:49| Somewhere in here, there is a concern that, and I guess by an adjacent property owner, that there be building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11629)|
| 3:14:01| and I do not anticipate, I mean, the property owner here, he'll have to speak for himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11641)|
| 3:14:07| but it's my anticipation that the property is vacant and it would be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| It's always been as it's used to lay out black pipe building materials because this gentleman is a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11651)|
| 3:14:21| He used to do houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| Now he's into renovations because of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| He provides employment in the Corrington area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| I don't know if he's got six or eight or ten people that follow him around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| and do that kind of renovation work on residential work in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11671)|
| 3:14:41| If the adjacent property owner thought there was going to be a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11681)|
| 3:14:45| I don't think that that can occur because of the size of the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| Now, building can occur, I guess, for residential B, which would then put a residence back in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11690)|
| 3:14:56| but it is landlocked from the road by the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11696)|
| 3:15:00| So I would offer a substitute motion that a plan amendment be submitted by commission to MPC for their perusal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11700)|
| 3:15:12| and that the entire parcel be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11712)|
| 3:15:18| Is it RC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11718)|
| 3:15:19| Rural commercial or commercial rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11719)|
| 3:15:25| I think it's RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| Yeah, I think you would be sending back initiating a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11728)|
| 3:15:34| for the entire track to be shown as rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| and then you already have your zoning, which applied to the entire track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11738)|
| 3:15:43| So both of those would then be go back through the loop to MPC if you choose to go that route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11743)|
| 3:15:49| and then come back to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| Probably, I guess it would probably get back here in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11751)|
| 3:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11756)|
| 3:15:57| We've got a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11757)|
| 3:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11761)|
| 3:16:02| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11762)|
| 3:16:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11763)|
| 3:16:04| Let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11765)|
| 3:16:06| That would come back to you in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11766)|
| 3:16:07| We'd have to have enough time to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| Back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| This is a general question, not necessarily about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| but if you have a small piece of property that really is landlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11778)|
| 3:16:24| no one can build on it because it's blocked by other pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| is it possible to change the zoning on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11789)|
| 3:16:33| but put a restriction just to make the neighbors feel good that no one's going to put up a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11793)|
| 3:16:41| or put up something else, in other words, put restrictions on the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| Or would that happen if someone went to build a building there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11805)|
| 3:16:49| and they went to get the permit to build and it wasn't appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| even though it was zoned, let's say, RC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| but not appropriate to put a building there because of setbacks and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| Because it looks to me like this little narrow piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| you're not going to have much room to put a building there just because of setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11823)|
| 3:17:10| I think in going and having another look at it, it's possible we could look at reasonable conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11830)|
| 3:17:19| I would have to be initiated, recommended by staff and initiated by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11839)|
| 3:17:25| You know, right now I can't tell you what those conditions would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| I don't know that we – I would hesitate to characterize what we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11850)|
| 3:17:35| but that's certainly something we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| But I can't guarantee, you know, that we could come up with something based on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11857)|
| 3:17:42| what the size and the configuration of that panhandle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11862)|
| 3:17:47| The reason I say that is it sounds like this piece of property has really been used like an RC for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11867)|
| 3:17:53| and it was just never brought to anyone's attention that it was actually zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11873)|
| 3:18:00| And, I mean, you really just can't see anybody building a house back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11880)|
| 3:18:04| It's too narrow because of setbacks to put a building there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| and he just wants to put some of the materials that are used with his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11888)|
| 3:18:14| And it seems like that would be appropriate for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| And it's not something, even if he sold the property, that anyone could ever do very much with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| Because that's when we zone things is that we've got to think what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11902)|
| 3:18:25| It's not what you say you're going to do with it, but what's going to happen 30 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11905)|
| 3:18:29| But even that piece of property doesn't look like it could ever, you know, be used in a residential way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11909)|
| 3:18:35| And I support Commissioner Wright's amendment or substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11915)|
| 3:18:42| For what it's worth, I did an eyeball calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11922)|
| 3:18:45| If I'm anywhere close to 75 by 300, that's right at half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11925)|
| 3:18:53| But it's sort of an odd shaped half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11933)|
| 3:18:56| I mean, odd for building anything on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11936)|
| 3:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11940)|
| 3:19:01| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11941)|
| 3:19:02| Mr. Wright, you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11946)|
| 3:19:07| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| Mr. Walker, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11949)|
| 3:19:10| Would you like to respond to any of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11950)|
| 3:19:13| Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11955)|
| 3:19:16| So our substitute motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11956)|
| 3:19:19| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| Does anybody need a restatement of the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11961)|
| 3:19:25| We good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| Let's restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11967)|
| 3:19:28| I'm getting some, well, some vibrations that I should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11968)|
| 3:19:36| Could you restate that, your substitute motion, Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11976)|
| 3:19:41| The restatement of the substitute motion probably will not be what the substitute motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11981)|
| 3:19:49| In essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11989)|
| 3:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| My substitute motion is, well, are we going to have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| Has something been written down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=11999)|
| 3:20:00| Well, we could try to read what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| The essence of the substitute motion is that the entire parcel be the sector plan amendment be initiated by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12004)|
| 3:20:15| and sent to MPC that the entire parcel be rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12015)|
| 3:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| Have we got that, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12030)|
| 3:20:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12031)|
| 3:20:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12032)|
| 3:20:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12035)|
| 3:20:38| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| The next item is 9-A-12-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12039)|
| 3:20:42| It's also a request of Jack Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| It's for rezoning from R.B. General Residential to C.R. Rural Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12044)|
| 3:20:48| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| I'll make a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12054)|
| 3:20:56| I think we'll have to go through the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12056)|
| 3:20:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12059)|
| 3:21:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| Go ahead, Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12063)|
| 3:21:04| I guess I would send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12064)|
| 3:21:07| You don't really have to do anything about the zoning because it will go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12067)|
| 3:21:11| It will follow whatever the plan amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12071)|
| 3:21:14| Make a motion to send this back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12074)|
| 3:21:16| Along with the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12076)|
| 3:21:18| Make a motion to send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12078)|
| 3:21:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12080)|
| 3:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12081)|
| 3:21:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| Is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12086)|
| 3:21:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12090)|
| 3:21:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12091)|
| 3:21:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| 9-B-12-SP is a request of Store Save Storage for Northwest City Sector Plan Amendment from LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12095)|
| 3:21:42| Low Density Residential to C. Commercial Properties located northwest side of Mary Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12102)|
| 3:21:47| southwest side of Primus Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12107)|
| 3:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12112)|
| 3:21:53| Is the petitioner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12115)|
| 3:21:56| Any staff comments on this one, Buzz, Mara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12116)|
| 3:22:02| This is a request for a commercial plan designation from Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12122)|
| 3:22:07| and rezoning from Agricultural to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12127)|
| 3:22:11| It is our understanding that the purpose of the zoning is for the expansion of an existing five-year-old self-service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12131)|
| 3:22:18| storage business to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| We looked at the request and also noted the trending zoning pattern in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12141)|
| 3:22:29| extending from the intersection of Primus and Murray on back to the northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12149)|
| 3:22:36| that you have a commercial pattern pretty much in place with rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12156)|
| 3:22:41| although the plan does not necessarily reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12161)|
| 3:22:45| We thought with the location there and then also proximity to the interstate visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12165)|
| 3:22:50| that it made sense to look at the plan amendment favorably with a recommendation to recommend commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12170)|
| 3:22:59| and then also the companion rezoning to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| This was a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| It was on that agenda, adopted 1201 by the Commission on both the plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12185)|
| 3:23:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12192)|
| 3:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12193)|

| 3:23:58| Page 12, item 9-C-12-SP is a request of Robert A. Maples for northeast county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12238)|

| 3:24:17| Is the petitioner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12258)|
| 3:24:21| Any staff concerns, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12261)|
| 3:24:25| Only with the request that was initially filed, the applicant wanted a plan change from low density residential to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12265)|
| 3:24:36| and a companion rezoning from RA, low density residential, to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12276)|
| 3:24:40| In looking at the relationship of the property to the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| we felt like that the office designation was more appropriate in that it could provide a buffer on the southwest side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12285)|
| 3:24:54| and try to hold the commercial right there at the interchange of Mascot and Old Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12294)|
| 3:25:01| This was discussed with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| The recommendation the staff was going to make for office, and it was our understanding he was accepting of that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12304)|
| 3:25:12| or that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12312)|
| 3:25:14| It made it to our consent agenda based on that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12314)|
| 3:25:19| So the planning commission, based on the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12319)|
| 3:25:24| voted to approve a plan amendment from low density residential to O office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12324)|
| 3:25:30| and a companion rezoning of RA, low density residential to OA office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12330)|
| 3:25:36| And, again, both those items are on our consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12336)|
| 3:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12339)|
| 3:25:40| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12340)|

| 3:25:45| I move to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12345)|

| 3:28:02| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12482)|
| 3:28:03| I didn't see you, Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12483)|
| 3:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12484)|
| 3:28:05| One fly in the ointment here, floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12485)|
| 3:28:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12490)|
| 3:28:11| What was the discussion about floodway zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12491)|
| 3:28:16| Not in any detailed discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| We typically, and as a matter of practice, recommended that floodway, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12499)|
| 3:28:26| anytime we have this kind of situation, that the floodway zoning be maintained on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12506)|
| 3:28:33| Just as a matter of course, it identifies that there may be issues with regard to drainage, stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12513)|
| 3:28:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| I think it stuck out as a red flag, but as a matter of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12521)|
| 3:28:44| Bud, could you come over to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| So what's that mean to you in terms of a businessman trying to develop this property in a floodway zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12527)|
| 3:28:54| What practical things are you dealing with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| I think the problem do I need to state my name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12537)|
| 3:29:00| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12540)|
| 3:29:01| Bud Cullen, 6312 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12541)|
| 3:29:07| Commissioner, the part that's floodway isn't changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12547)|
| 3:29:11| And one of the gentlemen from MPC, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| but I think what it means is because it's one tract of property and it has floodway zone and previously agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12555)|
| 3:29:24| When we change the zoning from agricultural to the CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12564)|
| 3:29:29| it has to be noted that the part that's in the floodway is still being kept as floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12569)|
| 3:29:35| From a practical standpoint, the zoning affects me not at all because it's in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12575)|
| 3:29:40| So we've had to deal with that through plans that we would do with TDEC and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12580)|
| 3:29:48| So the part that's in the floodway is not changing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12588)|
| 3:29:51| It's just it's part of an overall piece of property that for whatever reason when we originally purchased it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12591)|
| 3:29:57| the part of it was already zoned commercial and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12597)|
| 3:30:01| And it's been about 10 or 12 years ago when we bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12601)|
| 3:30:05| And now we're looking at possibly doing some development on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12605)|
| 3:30:08| and realize that the back part was still agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12608)|
| 3:30:11| So it's instead of agricultural and floodway, it will be CA and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12611)|
| 3:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12617)|
| 3:30:18| Is this Beaver Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12620)|
| 3:30:21| It's on Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12621)|
| 3:30:24| It's where the new Emory Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12624)|
| 3:30:25| It's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12625)|
| 3:30:26| We actually built the stub of it in the intersection when we developed a Walgreens drugstore there about 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12626)|
| 3:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12632)|
| 3:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=12633)|
