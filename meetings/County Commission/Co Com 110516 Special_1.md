| 2:52:43| Right now, we go through that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| We can tell you how many hotels we fill during our four-day festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| And for me, I'm just so frustrated about it because I think sometimes people subtly talk as if we're lying about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10371)|
| 2:52:59| or using extravagant numbers and all that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| It's so unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| I hate to be at this mic about this issue in relationship to African-American entities in our institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10385)|
| 2:53:13| and constantly saying that we, you know, we deserve a better shake out of this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10393)|
| 2:53:18| that where do you have institutions that we can keep growing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| We can't grow institutions if every year you have to get cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| Sometimes you come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| No continuity in that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| Now, I also want to ask, is being a world-class entity or world-class county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10411)|
| 2:53:38| is that actually important to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| Are we just really mouthing things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| One thing that I want to say, too, is that until we, I think that I always feel that African-Americans are treated as if we aren't welcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10422)|
| 2:53:50| that we're a burden, shut up, hurry up, get up out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| So I'm saying that until I think that we all feel welcome and as primary participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10434)|
| 2:54:00| and where money goes, the issues as it relates to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| that we have leaders, serving leaders in our community who can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| and put forward solutions that we know about and what we need as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10447)|
| 2:54:12| and then see that they're actually funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| It's just not a few core group of African-Americans that speak for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| We have a larger serving leadership base and participants in our community that can come up with solutions that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10460)|
| 2:54:27| that's worked and been tried and true to address those issues in relationship to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10467)|
| 2:54:32| Our Columbia camp, we serve 125,000, well, I wish, 125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| I don't wish to appear rude, but I've given you ten minutes, so if I could ask you just to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| we want to hear your comments, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| All right, so that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| I mean, that I do it like, that I know that our programs in relation to the festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10490)|
| 2:54:57| Haley Heritage School, the 13-foot statue that African-American Appalachian Arts developed and brought to this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10497)|
| 2:55:03| that the pictures are used to promote Knoxville all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| but the entity, African-American Appalachian Arts, who brought these things to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| were continuously underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10513)|
| 2:55:16| I would really like to get on, you know, have some type of conversations with anybody who's interested to help educate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10516)|
| 2:55:22| you know, everybody about who we are, what we do in the community, the issues in the African-American community, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10522)|
| 2:55:27| I'm open for that, and I want to appreciate for the support that you have given us over the 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10527)|
| 2:55:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| Thank you, Ms. Sharon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| I'm not going to belabor the point, but I would be remiss if I didn't just inform the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10540)|
| 2:55:47| and I think this just kind of puts an appropriate end to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10547)|
| 2:55:52| but I do want to acknowledge a young lady that got in her car this morning and drove here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10552)|
| 2:55:59| and has been sitting here patiently since the meeting started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| and would have continued to 8 p.m. or 8 a.m. the next morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10563)|
| 2:56:09| and she turned, I think, 103 this past March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| And Sister Lois Kelly is a testament of how important the Beck Center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10573)|
| 2:56:23| So I'd just like to acknowledge Ms. Kelly, and, you know, this is from her age down to my youngest son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10583)|
| 2:56:32| I mean, that really kind of speaks to the importance of Beck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| and the fact that she's been here, and if there are additional meetings about Beck, she'll be at those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10596)|
| 2:56:41| But it just kind of lets you know what the Beck is, not only to the African-American community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10601)|
| 2:56:46| but to Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10608)|
| 2:56:49| Thanks to all of you who have spoken, to those of you who have been here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10612)|
| 2:56:58| If you could make it brief, sir, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| Would you come to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10620)|
| 2:57:08| If you could give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| My name is Eddie Davis, and I'm an artist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| I grew up in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| I studied at the University of Tennessee for a year, and then I went to the Art Institute of Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10636)|
| 2:57:23| Then I graduated with a master's degree from the School for American Crafts in Rochester, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10643)|
| 2:57:31| But I came back to Knoxville about 10, 12 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10651)|
| 2:57:36| At that time, Knoxville was examining its economic status, and one thing they did, they hired this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10656)|
| 2:57:48| and out of that grew a study called Nine Counties in One Vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| So to me, this, and following the cultural development over that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10674)|
| 2:58:01| and just looking at the community and how arts, out of that commission, the Nine Counties in One Vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10681)|
| 2:58:11| they grew up a plan called the Cultural Plan for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| The arts and cultural organizations were highlighted as the key to developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10696)|
| 2:58:28| Art builds community, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| Art builds community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| Art is community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| Without art, you don't have a culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| You really don't have a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| So this, to me, is a reaffirmation of the fact that all of these cultural entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10720)|
| 2:58:50| are an important part of defining who we are as a community and as a culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10730)|
| 2:58:56| So to cut those, we're really cutting our own throats economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10736)|
| 2:59:02| and just in the quality of life in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| The quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| When I listen to these young people speak, the 25-year-olds, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10749)|
| 2:59:15| by note, knowledge is power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| So all the knowledge we can cram into our future generations is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| And really, culturally, it's very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10764)|
| 2:59:28| I mean, if you look at the world now, you've got all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10768)|
| 2:59:32| If we looked at Ben Lyon's situation, for example, I don't want to go off that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10772)|
| 2:59:38| but anyway, art builds community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10778)|
| 2:59:44| And this really is, that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10784)|
| 2:59:49| Well, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10791)|
| 2:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| We have a full agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| We have a full agenda that we need to get to, but I feel the need to take a quick break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| Before you do, while we're still on budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| I would like for us to make a formal request for an update on taxes, receipts for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10803)|
| 3:00:11| compared to last year, projections to the end of the year, and also on sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10816)|
| 3:00:17| When we go back into session, we'll make sure that we make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| We're going to take a five-minute break, and we will be back in approximately five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| and we'll begin our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110516special?start=10822)|
