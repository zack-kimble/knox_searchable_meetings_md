| 0:00:56| So do I have a motion to approve the minutes from the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=60)|

| 0:01:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=63)|

| 0:01:08| speak into the microphone, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation need to bring the completed documentation to the business tax office during business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| Applicants who have their permit approved tonight can pick up their permit at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| And if there's any application that's deferred, we will reuse the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=85)|

| 0:01:36| We have nine to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| So to say we have a full agenda is an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| So we'll go right into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=103)|

| 0:06:06| would be approved. Okay. But to get the loan he just needs approval. He doesn't need the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=366)|
| 0:06:12| permit. Is that what you're saying? Correct. Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay. Move for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=372)|

| 0:18:44| with responsibility for the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| athletic facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| I reside in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| but this is part of the territory I oversee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| So I know we've provided quite a wealth of information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| I'd like to take a few minutes to kind of walk through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| If there are questions, either now or as we walk through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| or at the end, whatever you prefer, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Everyone has, I believe, a copy or an electronic copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| So Aramark has been in the business for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| We operate businesses and licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| in all four professional sports leagues, as well as the NCAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| There are 12 permits in the NCAA venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| and those are just the venues that have sporting venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| that we've represented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| The 31 pro sports is equal to the first slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| And across the country, we have over 1,400 liquor permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| functioning at 366 different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| We're going to talk a little bit about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| No, go back. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| About TEAM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| TEAM is Techniques for Effective Alcohol Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| It's a consortium of concessionaires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| beverage companies, government agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| entertainment companies that lead to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| that led to form some policies around responsible service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| It's in our best interest to provide responsible service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| It's a big portion of our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| and we need to do it right and be able to continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| So what we'll do is, in the TEAM programme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| there will be certified trainers on-site at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Two of my staff have already been trained in the programme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| They will train all of our servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| so anyone touching alcohol will go through the full programme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| as well as all of our managers and supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| They're also programmed...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Through that programme will be the lead ushers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| and security staff on the university side of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| Once they complete the programme, they're tested, they're certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| and the certification is good for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Another portion of the responsible service is the IDing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| So we've decided to elect to go to a mandatory ID programme here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| So that means everybody will be IDed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| every time they present themselves for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| If you don't have an ID, whether you're 21 or 90,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| you will not be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| So that is our plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| We have validation guides I brought with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| That's a guide that shows the characteristics of the licences in all 50 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| We'll train our folks in those elements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Obviously, we'll have a special emphasis on Tennessee and the border communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| where the majority of the students come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| We'll also include in that the red box training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| which most states have some special characteristic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| that calls out the age of an underage person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| or tells when that person will be of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| All the border states have something very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| So we'll have special training on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| We'll also have special handouts in the stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| where the service is provided with special emphasis on those states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| The other things we're trying to do is trying to keep the responsible service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| and keep it out of the hands of the people that shouldn't have the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| We will not be serving the student sections of the various venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| We've decided not to have roving vendors in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| There'll be no more than two transactions, two beverages per transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| and we'll conclude the service at a significant time before the end of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| I think the documentation that we provided you showed examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| of the different signage for the different events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| And if it wasn't in that documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| it would be about 75% of the time of the regular expiration of the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| and 75% of the time of a regulation event is when we would conclude service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| We've proposed using special cups, a cup where beer is easily determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| So we're going to go with a clear cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| That will be easily identifiable from the ushers, the security staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| people monitoring the concourses and seating areas of the bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| We also engage alcohol compliance supervisors at every event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| So each of the alcohol compliance supervisors obviously complete the team program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and then they also go on to a further training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| which I think we've also provided within the documentation that we've provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| They go on, and their responsibilities really are, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| they make sure that everyone that's serving alcohol at that event has been team certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| So they will literally go through every list of every employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| with their expiration date and their certification number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| During the pre-event, they will also make sure all the appropriate signage is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| in all of the locations where we're offering alcohol for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| And then during the event, most importantly, they'll monitor our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| to make sure that our staff is doing what we've trained them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| you know, understand what intoxication looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| make sure that they're IDing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| and making sure they're serving no more than two drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| That staff will also document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I believe we provided examples of all the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| there's a documentation file for every event where we serve alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| and we maintain those files for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Excuse me, I'm going to ask some questions just so that I don't forget them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| How many supervisors are on duty at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| It will vary on the number, on the attendance of the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| the demographics expected for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Nyland Stadium will probably be somewhere around ten to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| It will vary, geography, how many stands are covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| attendance levels, those are things that go into factoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| And then the team training, is that in the documentation that you gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| the workbook, because I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| We did give you the workbook, it is part of the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| it's all embedded in the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| but we do have a stand-alone document here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| if you'd like to take one with you, we can provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| Okay, compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| The event staff, obviously, during the event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| they'll be looking for the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| they make sure the staff is doing their diligence in the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| We'll also have the law enforcement, security, and ushers within the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| in the bowls, looking for levels of intoxication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| pass-offs, attempts at pass-offs, and any issues that may arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| That will be in the neighborhood of probably over 1,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| at a football game, that we're looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| In addition, we're going to utilize the normal University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| crowd monitoring systems, whether that be visual, digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| they operate from a command post, and the university is committed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| they will help us monitor the crowd for those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| pass-off, intoxication, problems within the bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| Lastly, we partner with H.S. Brands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| which is a third-party mystery shopping company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| They'll come in once a month when we're serving alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| and then conduct shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| It will vary on the number of shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| and depending on which venue they are inspecting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| At a typical large venue, it's not unusual to send three or four of them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| each of them having ten different locations to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Obviously, at smaller events, it would be one or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| one person at smaller events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| but that will also vary dependent on the attendance expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| Additionally, there'll be messaging to fans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Obviously, at the point of sale, we will have our ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| the mandatory ID language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| We'll have our service limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| We'll also let them know when we plan on discontinuing service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| and they're also going to be posting the legal repercussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| of providing alcohol to minors that those individuals would be subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1623)|
| 0:27:12| In-venue messaging to the fans within the bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| The university has agreed and will be helping us with a public service announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| where they'll be able to text issues to the command post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| The command post would then be able to deploy the appropriate staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| to go deal with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| We will have a designated driver program in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| and we're working on a rideshare program for the facilities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1653)|
| 0:27:44| That's our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| First of all, thank you for providing much more detail in your compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| than was previously presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| I really appreciate that, and Mr. Maples, I really appreciate your responsiveness to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| as I've called to make inquiries about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| I do have several questions that I just, and they may be sort of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| in the form of input that I'd like for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| My first question is, what are the sizes of the beer cups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| that you'll be using for your pours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| They'll be 32-ounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| We plan on serving the cans, so they'll be 32-ounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| And again, that's done for speed of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Okay, so 32-ounces, each customer will have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| to purchase two 32-ounce cans at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| No, I should, the cup is 32-ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| The maximum size we'll serve is 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| The cup is larger because everyone knows beer foams, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| And we want to keep the line moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| So, okay, I saw that, that your maximum size is 25-ounces in a 32-ounce cup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| and they won't be filled completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Is that the only size beverage cup that will be used to serve beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| If there's times when we change a brand or craft beers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| or things that come in smaller packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| we would still get a cup that's oversized for the volume we're serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| just because of the fact that we have to pour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| So there's not going to be the option for buying like a 16-ounce pour or a 25-ounce pour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| It is just the one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Currently, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| There are obviously some infrastructure issues at some of the venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| And, you know, it really is about getting the fans back to the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| back to supporting the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| We came up with the size because it's really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| there are a number and the vast majority of the people come to the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| we're going to drink responsibly and are there to watch the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| It's going to be a challenge to get a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| So we wanted to be respectful of those fans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I do have some concerns just based on the serving size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| So if there were a 16-ounce size option and you were doing two per customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| maybe I could see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| But two 25-ounce beers, and I understand because I have been to similar events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| and have purchased two large beers and shared one with whomever I'm with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| I do think that there is the potential for people to buy two and just drink two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And so I have some concerns about the two beverage limit at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1833)|
| 0:30:33| So I just wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| And would like you to consider potentially reducing that to one per serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| I understand it changes the speed of service and it adds to the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| and ID checks and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| But my concern is primarily based on the serving size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| So second question, and this may be a question for somebody up here actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1852)|
| 0:30:59| My understanding is that KPD, when they do compliance checks, uses underage cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Is it even legal for a third-party entity to sell to a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| if they wanted to use an underage person for a mystery shopper, would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| Yes, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| They would be able to use an underage mystery shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Would you consider using, what you've said is that it would be a 25-year-old who looks younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| Well, in fact, we have had challenges with that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Generally, in this case, it's moot because we're IDing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| So it doesn't matter the age, they expect it to be IDed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1906)|
| 0:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| I think the idea is that, you know, using somebody who's underage sort of guarantees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| that they look underage versus, so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| So it's illegal in the state of Tennessee to attempt to purchase alcohol if you're under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| The Knoxville Police Department has the ability to be able to do that legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1929)|
| 0:32:09| We, as private citizens, do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| We'd be glad to participate and help the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| But that's the reason the mystery shopper program is targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| They have to be over 21, otherwise they themselves are committing a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| That was my clarification that I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Can you add a module for fake ID training to your, if it's not already in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| It is actually part of the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| We brought some books with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1958)|
| 0:32:38| The book we provided got a little voluminous, so we brought some with us and it is part of the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| We can certainly provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1966)|
| 0:32:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1967)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Sorry, I have a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Would you like me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1972)|
| 0:32:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| I'm going to skip that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| How are you going to ensure that all alcohol is disposed of as patrons exit the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1976)|
| 0:33:04| What's the plan for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| We will work with the university staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| It's going to be a new program for them for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| But it's going to be one of the requirements that are going to be imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1997)|
| 0:33:17| The alcohol can't leave the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| And so that would require, and this may be a question for Mr. Maples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| will the staff be retained as paid staff post-game as traffic is flowing out of the stadium to be able to adequately monitor that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2004)|
| 0:33:37| Yeah, let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| We have talked about that internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2021)|
| 0:33:41| First off, the cell, again, it appears we're talking about Leland Stadium at the time of the football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| With the stop of alcohol sales at the end of the third quarter, we don't anticipate that many people bringing things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| But that still could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Somebody could leave as soon as they buy the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| So we're looking at whether we're going to bring staff from other areas of the location and put them at the gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| But that will be something we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| We haven't decided exactly what personnel it will be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| But that will be their sole purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| We'll be checking in that clear plastic cup that they poured out as they exit the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| So that's something that's already being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| It's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| It's just not finalized exactly which personnel will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Which personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2070)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2071)|
| 0:34:31| Well, it is specified that you'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2073)|
| 0:34:33| So I just wanted to know what the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And we will comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Plan was with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2077)|
| 0:34:37| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| And then one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Would it be possible to add stronger language to the signage regarding penalties for sharing a beverage with an underage patron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2083)|
| 0:34:56| We would certainly be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2097)|
| 0:34:57| If you have a recommendation, we'll certainly take that under advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| And if it's appropriate, we'll use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| As I looked through the signage, I just think that that would really strengthen it to help customers understand that there are penalties for sharing your beverage or, you know, purchasing a beverage on behalf of a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2103)|
| 0:35:16| And I really do feel strongly that that needs to be included on your signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| I don't have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I would agree with you and put some of the onus back on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| It would help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2125)|
| 0:35:25| Understand what the repercussions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2128)|
| 0:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2129)|
| 0:35:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Council Member Welch covered most of my questions, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| I do have a question about, there are two different, there are a couple of different Aramark companies, the sports and entertainment and then the educational services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2136)|
| 0:35:45| And then two for Stokely, two for Nayland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Is that also, why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| We have two different operating companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| One is the sports and entertainment division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| The other is the higher ed division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| So our contractual relationships with the university are different, for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| And they're different legal entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| So there's the two different companies apply and need to have separate licenses as there's different contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| I couldn't fulfill all the requirements needed if we put one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Are they for different places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Is it also for different areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Generally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| They're different locations within the, you know, sports and entertainment generally does, well, we do the bowl areas, the general seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| In Nayland Stadium, that also includes the terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| But the suites and club areas is handled by the higher ed division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| I'm sorry if I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| Okay, so those are also people who have purchased tickets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Okay, I was trying to make sure it's not in the common food areas where the students go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| No, these are only, the bowl is the sports and entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| The higher ed is the suites and clubs within the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| My other concern is about how much beer a person drinks with what's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| If I had two 25-ounce cups, I mean, that's four cans of beer, even with the cutoff at 15 minutes or, you know, the last quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2218)|
| 0:37:10| whatever it is, I'm still going to be intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| What are you thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I mean, I believe that would even have my blood alcohol level at DUI levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| What is your plan about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| You said something about rideshare or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Right, there are different factors that go into blood alcohol content over time, what you've eaten, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2246)|
| 0:37:35| But yes, we plan on having a rideshare program in place for people to get a safe ride home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| And how will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| I guess Mr. Maples and the university and I have discussed setting some type of area up similar to an airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| where the rideshare folks could congregate in anticipation of the end of the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| and then try to come up with a plan that can expeditiously get them to where they need to be and get the fans out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| Would that be an area set up for Uber and Lyft as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Those would be examples of rideshare, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| And also, we will have a designated driver program in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| And how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Generally, if you sign up to be a designated driver and agree to drive those home that are drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| you commit to not drinking for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| We provide you with free soft drink, and then there's also a raffle for some type of a prize at the end of the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| That was another concern of mine, that the beer cup is see-through, but the soda cup is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| If I have beer in my soda cup, you won't know it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| It seems opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| It would be difficult to detect from a distance, true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| My concern is about most of the time when we hear about sexual assault and violence on campus, it's alcohol related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2337)|
| 0:39:06| So bringing it into that area is a big concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| And to be doing it just to increase sales, I think, is a tragedy to think about sales instead of the safety of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2351)|
| 0:39:24| So I have a lot of concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I would like it to be brought down to one beer instead of two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| I think that's a lot of alcohol to consume in one sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Ms. Rotter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| So I'm going to be very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| I'm touching on the exact same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Interestingly, this past weekend I was in a German restaurant near Cincinnati, and the options were a half liter and a liter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| I obviously don't think in the metric system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And my father-in-law informed me the liter was too much beer for me to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| So the whole table ordered a half liter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Everyone at the table that was of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| So a half liter is 16 ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| A can is 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| How did you guys arrive upon the 32-ounce cup with a 25-ounce pour, which is the equivalent of over two cans of beer, slightly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2411)|
| 0:40:21| What do you serve in your other facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| So, yeah, that's almost a liter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| And if you let people buy two, that's literally like going to the German restaurant and getting two big old steins almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| Well, I mean, in most instances, you know, twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| One, the 25-ounce has become really an industry norm, and it is about speed of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| It's about watching the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| From a pass-off perspective, you know, it's not going to be, it's still going to be able to be seen, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| an intoxication of finishing the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| It's really the purpose is to buy it for your significant other or guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| because by the time you finish a 25-ounce beer, you're not going to want to drink one that's been sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| It's not really a good experience at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| They were warm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| We generally don't see that, and this has just become the norm within the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| So that's the norm for the other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| You said you had 12 other locations that were NCAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| We serve 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I know I'm only responsible for a portion of those, but I can tell you that all of the ones I operate, that is, they are served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| and they are popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| It's also our competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| How long have you had those in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| They were introduced, I want to say, four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| And any particular issues that have arisen there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| I have questions, but you said there would be added enforcement by the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| There is law enforcement on duty currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| They have agreed to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Certainly when we identify our plan is when an underage or a passed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| or an intoxicated person is identified, they will be turned over to law enforcement and dealt with as that entity sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| So will there be an increase of police officers there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| I believe there's already over 200 law enforcement, over 300 law enforcement people on site during the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2559)|
| 0:42:49| That's already the usual standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| The other thing that will help, it helps with the level of drinking outside as well, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| People don't binge drink to get in because they can get that beer inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| And, you know, so it culls some of the problems that those law enforcement would have otherwise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| So I understand that just due to the volume of information and training materials that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| that there may be some things that weren't included in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So can you tell me a little bit about how employees and volunteers are trained to identify an intoxicated individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2608)|
| 0:43:40| The team program was in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| It might have been lost within the volume of it, and I can provide a clean copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| But first it teaches how alcohol is absorbed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| There's certain factors that go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| You see, you know, Mike coming back three and four times, and you understand how alcohol works over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| You know, it's also the other elements that affect it or whether the person has eaten or not, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| And sex also plays into the role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| So we teach the individuals those characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| and then we also talk to them about what happens with an intoxicated person, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| They've lost some motor skills, fumbling with money, you know, loud or boisterous, inappropriate language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2657)|
| 0:44:24| you know, motor skills, you know, overpaying, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| So specific behaviors of persons who are intoxicated is included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Mr. Maples, this may be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| So as you're developing your plan for the staffing and personnel who will be stationed at exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| to ensure that people are disposing of any alcohol that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| will those individuals also be trained to understand and identify the signs of intoxication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2691)|
| 0:45:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, and they will be in contact with their supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| who in turn can contact our command post and immediately dispatch an officer to a location or a gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| if they suspect someone's intoxicated to the point that they could be a danger to themselves or others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| They will all be trained to contact, the protocol to contact their supervisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| and in turn contact law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| What's the projected timeline on having the plan in place for a designated driver program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| The first event, we serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Okay, which is, remind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| There will be, if we are fortunate enough to be approved, August 3rd for the Alice Cooper show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| At Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| At Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| At Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Okay, I'm ready, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| How much money will Aramark be making off of these sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| I couldn't project the amount of money that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| I mean, I don't know what the sales are going to be, the characteristics of how we're going to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| I mean, in our previous experience where we've gone to a university selling alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| it comes into $4 to $5 per attendee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| I mean, overall, what do you think the profit will be from Knoxville in adding these sales, alcohol sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| The overall profit is, we are a very low margin business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| You may not know that, but our profitability at the university is probably sub-10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| And about how much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Last year, you want to know how much profit we made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Is that something I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Yeah, well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| University last year, we made under $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| Okay, so what are, you have 12 other venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| You've got another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| What, is the margin about the same at the other venues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| Not the margin, but the profit line with selling alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| It varies from our contractual deals, you know, and the age of those deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| But this business has turned, quite frankly, similar to some of the grocery stores, it's a low margin business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Mr. Dingwood, and we can get more from Gwen McKenzie, and then we're running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| So, interesting article that Forbes had on sobering thoughts about alcohol sales at college stadiums December 1st of 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| that indicated that it was a very lucrative business for the vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| however could increase substantial costs for universities if there are issues with them having to hire additional security, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2867)|
| 0:47:56| Also pointing out the issues that incur at colleges just trying to curb under with a student drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2876)|
| 0:48:04| there are statistics related to alcohol abuse disorders in students at colleges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| and also that almost 700,000 sexual assaults involve students and alcohol a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2890)|
| 0:48:19| And also that 1,800 college students die annually from alcohol-related injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| So all that to say that there are a lot of concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| even though it sounds like this is implemented at several universities and colleges across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2908)|
| 0:48:37| I also have concern with the amount of alcohol that's being purchased at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| The fact that I know the premise would be that I'm going to buy two beers, one for me and one for whoever I'm sitting with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| However, we could see instances where students are buying both of those for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| and college students don't care if the beer is really cold or hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| It's just the fact that they want to drink it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| So with that said, I would like to ask you who would incur additional expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| if there initially are issues and additional security is in order moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| based on any types of incidents alcohol-related with student consumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Our business arrangement with the university, I assume, is public record to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| Obviously, we have certain obligations on both sides of that equation on who is responsible for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| So it would be either us or the university who would have to fund any additional programs we may wish to deploy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2973)|
| 0:49:43| I can't say I know for sure, but the university, the size, breadth, and prestige of the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2983)|
| 0:49:52| I'm sure has many programs in place to deal with all of the things that you're discussing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| Again, if you need to speak to some of those, again, our intention is not to serve the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=2999)|
| 0:50:08| You're not serving in the student section, you said earlier, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| But that's not to say that the students will not be drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| They won't, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| And you're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| I'm sure the university does have mechanisms in place to address these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| but what we don't want to do is we don't want to exacerbate that by adding or contributing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| The fact that if additional security or different measures need to be in place based on the initial sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| and your answer to be that you think it would probably, that cost potentially could go to the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| then that cuts into any profit margin that the university would gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| And also that when I look at profit margin for the university, I think of benefits to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| And so I think I would like to hear maybe a more definitive answer on who would incur those costs if that becomes necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3051)|
| 0:51:00| Madam Councilwoman, let me just say that Aramark serves at the pleasure of the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| and if the university is incurring more costs than they want to take on, they can tell Aramark to stop serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| It's clearly at the discretion of the university whether or not alcohol can be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| And so I think that sort of takes care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| If it gets expensive, I think they'll make a decision we don't want alcohol at the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| And they would not incur any additional costs if this were to get passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and they decided that they didn't want to serve alcohol anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| They could just end the contract with Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| It could be an event-by-event decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| But, yeah, the university is poised to do what we can to make sure that this will be a safe environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| We're going to put the personnel in a place we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Right now, I'm telling you, we're not putting like, for instance, again, we're talking specifically about football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| We feel, and I can tell you I have been involved for almost 30 years with the security and operations of the football games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3118)|
| 0:52:07| and I can assure you that we have more law enforcement personnel in our stadium than any other stadium our size anywhere in the SEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| So we feel like we have ample staffing there right now to do what we need to do to ensure the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| Once again, when we talk about the students, students, you know, 80 percent of our students are under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| So they will not be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| So I don't really think that's really the, I mean, to me, the concern is what happens post-game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| I don't think that alcohol consumption within the event is going to carry over because of the limitations we're putting on the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3159)|
| 0:52:49| And, again, I can assure you it will be a huge point of emphasis with all our workers to watch for underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3169)|
| 0:52:57| That is going to be a point of emphasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| We will also do that in a press release prior to events that we will watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| And very likely you could be carded twice for the purchase of a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| If you're, say, you're 21 and you don't look 21, but you are, you purchase that beer and you walk down to your seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| and the officer sees you and questions that and calls up the law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| law enforcement will come down and ask that person again to show me your ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| That's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| And we will tell people that's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| So, again, I truly believe that we will have the personnel in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| But if we need to employ more, we will look at that if we feel the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| That's what we have to do to ensure the safety of our patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| And I don't have any doubt that Aramark will make sure that no one under 21 purchases a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| But I don't think there's a lot of assurance that they will not be drinking a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| because they could have a friend over 21 that buys two beers and then hands one off once they sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| But that could happen anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| But they're liable when they hand it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| When they hand it off to somebody that's underage, they're liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| And then law enforcement and the criminal act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| As a matter of fact, we've talked to our chief and we're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| We see that and we have cameras in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| If you hand it off, the person who handed it off over 21 will be cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| for contributing to the delinquency of a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| and the underage person will be charged for underage consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| We will cite them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| There will be no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| I would like to make a motion, unless there's other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| I'd like to make a motion to approve this permit pending three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| That the applicant provides a plan for signage that includes penalties to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| that provide alcohol to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| That there's a designated driver plan submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| And that the staffing plan for the exits includes a plan for ensuring the alcohol is disposed of on exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3303)|
| 0:55:13| and includes specific training for identifying and addressing intoxicated persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| We haven't gotten that far yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| So first we've got to go through and hear Sergeant Cowher and get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| We can't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Hold that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| We'll take these one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| We'll go through them five times the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| So anyway, that's where we'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| That is no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| So the motion is that we, and I don't know how y'all would address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| so how do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| Do you want to resubmit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| I mean, you're actually asking for it to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| No, I'm not asking for it to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| I think that could be turned into staff, and as long as that plan is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| I'm going to trust our professionals on staff to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Mark, are you comfortable with those three items and reviewing those, Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| I'm comfortable telling you that we received the item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| not the content of what's in the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| or whether you think it's adequate or not would fall back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| So are you comfortable then just turning it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| I'm comfortable with them turning it in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| I'd love to see it, but I'm comfortable with turning it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| We'll provide a copy to Mr. Frost as well if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| So the motion is with these three stipulations stated again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| and then they would turn it in, and then they will distribute it prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| But it will be, this will be approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| That will be part of the documentation they have to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| And you won't have a chance to review it, but they will provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| So those three items are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Say it again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Signage that includes penalties for providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| for individuals who provide alcohol to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| a designated driver plan, and a plan for staffing at exits that includes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| that ensures the alcohol is disposed of on exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| and provides training for identifying and addressing intoxicated persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| and they had indicated that they were working on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| The permit, once it's approved, if it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| then they don't need to come back in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| That's for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| I would like to add something about if we see problems come up that we have a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| So I'd like to add to Council Member Welch's amendment motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| I'd like to add, if we see police issues come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| I don't know how to phrase it, if we see detriment to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| Mr. Frost, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| I appreciate that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| There's really not a mechanism in place for it to come back under review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| unless there's some underage sales or are over-serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| or serving to intoxicated individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| Then, you know, that mechanism is in place, Councilwoman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| but I'm not aware of us having the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| or the billboard having the ability to have a check-in, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| I can't request another review in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| If they were cited, then they'd come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| They'd be before a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| They would come back to us on an administrative review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and then we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| But is it arbitrarily just check-in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| I mean, it'd have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| You know the citations that they do on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| If we get those, they come back before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| then the billboard would have an opportunity to react to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| So we have a motion and a second with the three stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| So eight for and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| So Neyland Stadium, Aramark Suites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| And with the three same stipulations, is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Regal Soccer Stadium, Aramark S&E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| And we need fire prevention approval on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| So I move to approve pending final documentation with the same stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| With the three stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| And one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Thompson Bowling Arena, Aramark Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| The file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Same motion to approve with the stipulations previously cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190716?start=3610)|
