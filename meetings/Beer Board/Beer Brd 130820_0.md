| 0:05:08| So, anyway, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=308)|

| 0:07:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Knox County records indicate Mr. Powers has a conviction for solicitation to commit false| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| reports in May of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| What does that mean, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| When Sergeant Hunter did the background beer board records checks, we brought that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| attention of the law department and the police department, who found out the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Under Section 4-37, which deals with the qualifications of permittees and employees, if someone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=467)|
| 0:07:56| been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, they are not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| We've determined that Mr. Powers is not eligible to be on this beer permit, and I would respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=485)|
| 0:08:14| suggest to the beer board that perhaps postponing this application for a month where they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| find a manager that would qualify would be a good option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Is there anyone else here from Shuck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| Would you like to come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Asha Matthews, 5200 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Because of this finding, this gentleman cannot be associated with Shuck in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| So we have a suggestion from our lawyer that we postpone this so that you will have an opportunity to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| replacement, and there are also some other things that are inspections and things that need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| The next meeting of the beer board is September 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| 17th, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| I was way out of line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Do I have a motion to postpone this until September 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=558)|

| 0:09:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| So you understand you need to have a new manager who must go through the task class, and that you also need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| these other things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=568)|

| 0:10:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Do you want to make any change in your application as a result of something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Bear permit without dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| So, council, we need to note that this will be without dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| And when we get to Ms. Dyer, she'll tell why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=614)|

| 0:10:34| The file is complete pending the change for no dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| And why do we have that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Fire inspection would not approve dancing on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=642)|

| 0:13:00| Come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Do you have to abstain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| We're now back to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Oh, no, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Let's do the addendums and give those people a little more time to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| The first one is stock and barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| Ms. Dyer, do you have anything to say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| I have met all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| and picked up the beer permit was released on August the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| And the next one is from the Knoxville Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| and it's for the event that's coming up on September 20th, and this is Art Gone Wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=808)|
| 0:13:36| And we don't really need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| They just wanted us to know that this was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| They had a permit for several events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Is that what they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| So this is just one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| This is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| I think they'll be coming back for another one in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Now let's go to the heel of the agenda again, the Heidi Tai and Japanese Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| Heidi Tai and Japanese Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| They were here last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| and their problem is that they are within 300 feet of two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| One is the Tyson House Student Foundation that is a center for homeschooled children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| and the other one is St. ‑‑I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| There's another religious-type thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| So they're within the 300 feet, and in order for them to sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| they're going to have to get a TABC license probably to sell wine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| and then that reduces the number of feet to 50 feet, and I think they'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| I had an e-mail from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| They responded to that e-mail, explained the situation, and they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| So Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Yeah, I'll make a motion to postpone this to the September 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| And I'll, again, try to get in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| And the next is the New Wave City Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=903)|
| 0:15:15| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Christina Blantz, 2531 MLK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Oh, my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=923)|

| 0:15:31| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| We need the health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| This is off premise, so they don't have to worry about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Anything else for the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| I just had a question for the sergeant there, Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| What is solicitation to commit false reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| He was actually charged with false reports, initiating a false report, which is TCA 3916-502,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| which actually is a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| When it was adjudicated, it was reduced to a Class A misdemeanor, which is the solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| As a misdemeanor, does it disqualify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| I'd be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| I mean, since it's already passed on the agenda after the meeting is concluded, I'd be happy to fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130820?start=1000)|
