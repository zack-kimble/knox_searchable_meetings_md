| 0:00:46| the last and final Chairman's Briefing, please mark it on your calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| Monday, August 9th at 5 p.m. over at the E911 EMS Service Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=51)|
| 0:00:59| Former Commissioner Brad Anders, who's the director there, will be hosting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| A meal will be provided, and we will have an educational session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| about our 911 and EMS services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| So Monday, August 9th, 5 p.m. at the Barnard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=69)|
| 0:01:17| We'll make sure you get all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| Just as a quick reminder, we're going to start this first session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| talking all about our retreat, and then we'll take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| We'll run this probably until 445 or however much time is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| We'll take a quick break, and then we'll come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| and we'll start the discussion about the merit system at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| So without further ado, I would like to recognize Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| and Commissioner Durrett, and take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| Courtney, I very much appreciate that you all participated in the retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| that you came, that you were active in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| And, you know, like anything that this commission does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| I think we all have a shared goal of wanting to always try to do it better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| the next time, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| So I think you all see that you've got a survey in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| and sometime before maybe you leave this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| or maybe before we start the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| You don't have to do that right this minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| but if you wouldn't mind just filling that out and giving it to Drew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| I promise you we're not going to try to identify your writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| We'd really like a full and honest assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| and also assessment of if this is something we need to continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| And if we do, do it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| and whoever takes the leadership role in this next year will have a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| bit of a springboard, things to start on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| So I gave all of you a copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| and it's headed up Leadership Facilitation Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| if everyone's got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| If you wouldn't mind just taking a minute to kind of scan through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| I'm not going to read it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| but it is a good overview of the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| I tried to reflect on this after Courtney and I could get away from it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Sometimes when you're right on top of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| you don't see them in quite the same light that you do when you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| little distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| And under themes to leave behind, which is at the bottom of the first page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| I remember when someone had said operating in silos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| that I wasn't real sure I believed, not that I didn't believe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| but that I felt like that was so true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| But then, I will tell you, I saw an article in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Commissioner Busler, of some of the new road work you were getting out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| your district, state and local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| And I looked at that and I thought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| I have been in kind of a silo because sometimes we get so focused on our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| district that we don't look at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| So that kind of hit home with me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| If you all will look at page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| when we did this strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=269)|
| 0:04:38| I personally felt very encouraged when we listed these weaknesses because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| felt like there are some areas where we're already targeting to try to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| And just a couple of things that kind of stood out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| we're talking about an outdated growth plan and you know we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| as we speak, working on making some changes in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| Citizens not plugged into elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| that might be a discussion at some point in time for us to have collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| because I think we all are dismayed at the voter turnout many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| especially in our local elections and would like to see a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| interest that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Some comments about parks and rec and I'm thinking we have a new director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| that we're going to be meeting here in the next week or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Some of you probably already met him and thinking this is perhaps an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| opportunity for what was wrong to be made right in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| And diversity of leaders, also noting that the new hire is a man of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| and I notice more and more as we look around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| I think that our sensitivity I hope is increasing to the point where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| much more sensitive to what others expect and need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| and widen ourselves more in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| Communication, I'm hopeful that this retreat might be the beginning of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| other things that we are getting ready to do that just opens up communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| And slow process, if anyone can fix that one, they're better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| Again, those are just some of the immediate thoughts that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| If anyone has any comments, a thing or two they'd like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| now would probably be the appropriate time in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| I mean, what do you think, good, bad, y'all, waste of time, not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| I mean, this is in the survey, but just give us a little bit of feedback here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| I'll start us off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| I think that these are worthy sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| I mean, we've done two of them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| Obviously, we're off one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| But I think they're good because the goal is to constantly figure out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| get better, how to open up more lines of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| We talked a lot in this retreat that we often don't get a lot of time to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| around and spend time together, open discussion about various topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| get to know each other, get to know each other's families, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Because of the restrictions that we're under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| we only ever see each other in these settings where it's very difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| build time and communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And I think that having an outside facilitator always pushing us to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| do more is a helpful tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| I do think that one thing that's the hardest that we have to work on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| timing of both the days, the times, and the time of year is participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| This is one of those things where everybody's got to be in or it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| And we had some timing issues and work issues and some things where it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| hard when half the room's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| And so I think we've got to work better on how do we find the optimal time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| where everybody can kind of be in and focus on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| I also think the walkaways are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| I was actually surprised the very first year we had a list of projects we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| We were off a year, and by the time we revisited that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| we surprisingly looked at it and went, we probably had 75% to 80% of it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| So having those real walkaways I think are key of who's going to take what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| and who's going to drive the boat on certain topics so that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| constantly getting away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| It's kind of like these chairman's briefings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| This is the only time we have to really dig into big, big issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| So I think that they're worthy, and I would encourage us to do them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| probably more in the January timeline or time frame where we can maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| combine our legislative agenda with our state leaders but in a time where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| it's not so busy for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Why is that up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Well, that's a little surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Because there's a few things that Courtney and I didn't get to in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| retreat that we're going to finish up in the next few minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| So that's why that's up there, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Thanks for that input, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| And I'm going to go ahead and turn this over to Courtney now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| She's going to just review a little bit of our styles inventory and remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| us, because it really does, this kind of thing really does reflect and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| us know how to sometimes deal with our fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| So, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| If you all will look in front of you, there should be a very small packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| that looks like this with the different squares on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| It starts with upper left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| And these are the learning, thinking, and working styles that we, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| had to go through and rate those four words based on their significance to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| And so, again, I'm not going to read through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| This is just a reminder of what we discussed there and where each person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| in their learning, thinking, and working styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| I think this is important to know where we are all coming from when we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| making decisions, especially in this setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Like Larson said, we don't get to see each other a lot and be with each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| other outside of the setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| So, it does help us learn more about each other and know where each person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| The upper left had the most members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| And these are your risk takers, your creative and innovative typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| characteristics of these people leading by energizing people and holding up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| These are kind of your doers, the ones that want to take action now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| And as you can see, we have one, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Well, technically eight if we count our diamonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Upper right, these are more sympathetic, sensitive, leads by trust and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| participation, and there are two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| It looks like Terry is our only lower left, though she was also a upper left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| And these are your personal forcefulness and determination leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| And then lower right, Commissioner Beeler is there as our leads by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=693)|
| 0:11:41| principles and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| And so, when you have a minute, just look through this or keep it with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| when we come to our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| So, if we do get in a debate, we can think back and realize where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| person is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| But I do want to point out, as he said, our two weirdos, Kyle and Randy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| that we're equal in all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| So, just remember that as we're going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| Did you all have any aha moments looking at that or reflecting back on it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Do you think it was correct or incorrect based on your thought process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| Because this was something I did, well, something similar that I did when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| teaching was learning styles and how to approach children that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| So, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| I'm always curious to know if it's accurate or not or if you think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| I know mine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| I've never been accused of not being straightforward, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| But I think some others on this commission should have been listed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| too, but anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| Okay, looking at the next steps review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| If you'll turn to the last page of the handout that was the one on leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=780)|
| 0:13:12| that I gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| I'm sorry, the second to the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| In our next steps, it is very important, I think, no matter what a retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| produces that there is some follow-up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Sometimes one of the biggest downfalls in groups is that people come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| they've got a lot of good ideas, there's a lot of good brainstorming going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| and then when you walk away, it walks away with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| And I'm very excited about this group of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| I do feel like that we've got some action-oriented people in this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and it shows because when we look at next steps, the new stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| what we've seen that there's already a, what do they call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| a block party that's going to be coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Yeah, there's several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| That's the first of, I think, three or four upcoming meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| So we are moving forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Mental health report, I know that that will be coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| but I'm also very excited to know that there's some pretty active discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| with some of our American Relief Act money as far as directing specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| toward what we have all recognized as the need for strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| in mental health services and even mental health beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| So as I reflect back on that, it's exciting to see that we're all on that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=881)|
| 0:14:50| This dashboard, I think that some of what Andrew has been doing for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| very much is kind of plugged into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| We had a request to him about giving us more of a monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| or bimonthly update, and I'm certain he's been as efficient with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| as he has been with me to try to get to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| and make sure that we are kept up to speed on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| So I was glad to see that that next step had occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| It's interesting the grocery store issue came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| and then we've already seen in the paper that, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| it looks like a grocery store is going to be potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| a part of this new stadium project, assuming the stadium comes to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| So I thought that was very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| We know we're not thinking in a bubble on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| Others are certainly in line on that thinking too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| Chairman briefing topic, Larson, I'd like to just take a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| to thank you personally for these briefings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| I know sometimes it's been a little discouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| because maybe attendance hasn't been the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| and I speak for myself in that because I have ended up having more conflicts than I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| But it has always been good to have that information at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| and to be able to go back and watch it or get the handout and all to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| So I'm very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Courtney and I, in fact, because we're both check-off-the-box kind of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| we are doing this wrap-up retreat for the commission, so we've got that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| And I think the process of making sure that we're getting the most out of our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=997)|
| 0:16:44| out of our office, is always going to be an ongoing process in looking in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| And then communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| There's always room for improvement, of course, with communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1018)|

| 0:30:35| And we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| We're discussing the lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1836)|

| 0:30:42| Now, trustee Humphrey called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| He has every right to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1845)|

| 0:30:49| there is no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1849)|

| 0:31:01| But our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1861)|

| 0:31:08| that issue is non-debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| It ends the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1871)|

| 0:31:17| The vote is to determine whether or not there's been sufficient debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=1877)|

| 0:36:22| to talk about next steps for the next commission retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2182)|

| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| We'll kind of reconvene our chairman's briefing and welcome everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Just a quick reminder of a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| This is a chairman's briefing, which is an information session for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| We don't have lights at our tables, so I'll do my best to keep an eye out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Please just kind of raise your hand or wave, and I'll keep the order as best we can on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| If there are several department heads or others, if we need to call on people, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| We'll have them introduce themselves as normal and then dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| Just as a quick setup for the meeting today, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| we've been discussing the merit system and the council in much detail for well over a year at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| and certainly in the last several months in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| There are currently four ordinances that are on before you for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| Those were submitted in June and then deferred to July on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| and several people asked to have more time to dig into the details of both the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| the proposed changes, and any other questions having to do with the merit council and the merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| as it's a pretty detailed and complicated entity that we oversee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| So here we are at this chairman's briefing, so it's your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| We have been given a book, and a copy of that book has been provided to Ms. Taylor from the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| This book is not comprehensive of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| It's just some of the tools necessary for today's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| Certainly if you want a full comprehensive policies, procedures, everything, then we can provide that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| But these are the kind of documents that people wanted to see, some of the e-mails that had been passed around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| asking for more information and just kind of consolidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| So the first tab is just the overview of what the council is, what are the terms, who's on the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| what their terms are, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| The legal tab has three different memos dating back to August of last year from Law Director Book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| explaining different structural or legal elements of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| There's a breakdown of the personnel on staff, salaries, job descriptions, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| There's also an overall budget of the merit system office and personnel and team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| These are the same documents that were provided last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| These are the four ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| They have a, for lack of a better term, a rationale document on top, kind of summing up what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| and then the actual ordinance and some of the red line documents behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| These are the same four that you were given before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| And then the minutes from the special committee that met between October and January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| four sets of minutes that were signed and submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| So, again, not comprehensive, but most of the tools for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| So that's all been provided to you and a copy to the merit team as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| and we can certainly provide any further documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| So we'll start the chairman's briefing with tossing it over to Director Book, kind of outline where we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| and then at that point it's kind of up to you all to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and let us know how you want to start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| So, Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I'm just going to, you've already seen this, most people have been at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| Just in brief, county commission, no question, has total control over the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:38| Appointments, they can increase it, they can decrease it, they can do what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| they can get rid of council members if they so desire, just on the six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| That's where it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| There are some issues that have come up, and the main ones I see are increasing this from three to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2453)|
| 0:41:05| For instance, city of Knoxville has five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| Memphis has five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| Nashville-Davidson County has five on their merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| There's a new merit system there under the state law, which we are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| We are under our own private act, which was passed 50 years ago, and we're still operating under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| And some of the things that have come up, you've heard in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| are in this day and time when it is very difficult, as I understand it from Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| to recruit new officers and they're down at the detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| they're down on patrol, the city of Knoxville is facing the same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| and so the recruitment type of thing, which was very long and involved under the rules as they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| was something that Sheriff Spangler wanted to change, and part of that's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| Keep in mind this is all policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| This isn't legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| This is all policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| This commission makes the policy on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| I think the best thing to do is just I'll be here to answer any questions about the legality of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| but the bottom line is the legality is the county commission has control of the budget and the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| Now, what the county commission doesn't have control over is the council itself is a quasi-judicial body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| when it hears appealable grievances, and that's another word in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| because it's very clear in the present rules what is an appealable grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| what goes before the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| It's not every grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| It's itemized in their rules, and I'd also point out that most all of the rules that are already in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| I mean some 30-some-odd pages that have been going on for years are good rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| They're good rules, and they're not this commission has indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| and I have seen nothing that would in any way endanger the protection of the merit council for our officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2582)|
| 0:43:11| and for our classified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| That will still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| So with that, I'll just so as not to prolong the meeting and lawyers tend to talk too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| I'm going to turn it off, and if anybody has questions from commission, I'll be glad to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| Thank you, Director Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Does anybody want to start the discussion off or have questions to Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I guess I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| Paula and I met Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| I think Paula and I met Tuesday for a couple hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| I got quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| We talked, and I think the best way for us to do this is to look at each ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| change any ordinance, and go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| We can do it now or we can do it whenever we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| I'd rather do it now and get it over with so it won't be drug out at our county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| Our first one is item 47, section 42-53, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| Just to be clear, is this the ordinance change recommendation number one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| There's one, two, three, and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| It's one. This is the adding members to the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I'm sorry, Commissioner Daly, but I agree with your idea that we should go through these one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| line by line, that it's changed, and ask both sides their opinion of it and the law director's opinion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| But if we could refer to these by the 104-105, it would probably be easier to keep straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| If it pleases everybody, since I'm the author of this overview document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2689)|
| 0:44:58| just walk through as written and we can stop at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| So are we starting with 101?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| I mean, I would just start with 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| This is your tab that has proposed ordinances, and you have a top sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| This is sort of the rationale sheet, if you will, that is ordinance change recommendation number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| This is sections 42-53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| And it would be ordinance 0-21-6-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| So recommendations and rationale in this ordinance proposed change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| it increases the size of the merit system council from three to five members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| it eliminates the alternative member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| and it adds a county commissioner in a non-voting capacity as part of the jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| And the real rationale for this is really to broaden the input of citizens into policymaking decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| in this quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| As noted, different councils have different sizes, but none have just three members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And it also, a larger body, regardless of who's on the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| would dilute any potential possibility of favoritism to the officer or to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| So the goal is to sort of make it broader with more membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| And that's the first part of 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| Okay, I'll just keep going until somebody stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| Okay. Exhibit A, the one voting member shall be professional law enforcements or corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2787)|
| 0:46:37| It used to be five years out of the law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| Now we're moving to propose to move it to ten. Why from five to ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| The ten, let me see if I explained that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Yeah, on the third bullet on the rationale document, well, let me do this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2811)|
| 0:47:00| The second, let me just read through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| The second bullet point of this is to define particular skill sets to the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| So instead of just having one of the things that was talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| it was having some people that had human resources or legal experience, law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| and then increasing the length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| The idea of increasing that to ten years would be to maintain some independence from any elected sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| So five years, basically you could still be in the same sheriff's administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| Ten years puts it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I mean, it doesn't guarantee it because somebody could run, sit out for a term, and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| But in most cases, I would guess that it would put it outside of the two-term sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| So you had somebody that wasn't a former employee immediately go into a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| where they were judging other fellow employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| That's what I thought, but I just want to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Actually, I have no problem with the ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Can I comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I get the just and the rationale for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| but we also have to remember that you can have a former elected official come back after they sit out a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| It doesn't guarantee it, but it just sort of reduces the amount of potential for somebody to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| I think the goal in that is to make sure somebody wasn't an active law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| or certified personnel under one administration leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| and then within that same administration end up on the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| that would be making decisions against their fellow coworkers under the same administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| It's just built with another layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Adding five more years adds another layer of potential buffer, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| When we add this five-years layer, these volunteers, and they are volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| they're volunteers for abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| Sometimes it may be hard to find somebody that's ten years out that would want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| Same thing with the next one coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| It also doesn't prevent other people with law enforcement experience from serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| Somebody could have worked for the FBI or another agency around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| This is just a buffer for the immediate employees of an administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| What if somebody moves in from, I think we had a candidate come from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| They could serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| So it's got to be an officer not from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| It's just they can't have worked for the Knox County Sheriff's Office within ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| So they could have worked for KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| They could work for Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| They could work for the California Highway Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| It's just the internal administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Voting members shall have professional experience, legal or human resource profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| We're tying that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| What if we don't get anybody that qualifies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| I mean, you know, they may not want to take the abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| So what do we do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Well, I think you've actively recruited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| I haven't seen a situation even on boards that qualified from a degreed standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| that we haven't been able to find somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| We just had one of our health boards we couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| No one wanted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Can I jump in on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| I'm kind of with Commissioner Daley on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| I think that we're more than capable of judging who qualifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| and who has enough qualifications for each position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| If we want to try to find somebody that has a law background, I think as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| we can look for resumes that have a law background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| I don't know if we need to shrink down our pool automatically on the five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| I would just keep it at five open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| So my only stipulation on the five is that I don't think any elected officials should be on the AmeriCouncil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3052)|
| 0:51:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| It was hard to hear that last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| I don't think any elected officials should be able to be on the AmeriCouncil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| If you hold a public office, you should not be able to be on the AmeriCouncil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| That would be a non-voting member, just like we have on the ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| The five voting members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| We had a current elected official apply to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| I mean, the way it's written is the elected official would only be a non-voting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| I'm saying an elected official submitted her application to be a voting member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| and I don't think any elected official should be able to be a voting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| But we would be voting on that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| You wouldn't point one of your own colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| I'm not saying one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Not commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Any elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Any Knox County elected official should not be able to apply to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| Okay, so you're suggesting in this particular section to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| To add that, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Okay, I just want to clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| There's no prohibition in the rules as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| However, in the state law, the Sheriff's Merit Council state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| there's a specific provision, which we can easily cut and paste into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| which forbids an elected official from serving on the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| I would like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| So you're suggesting that addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Whenever we go through these two, if you all could clarify if you have suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Is it an edit or an addition or deletion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I would like to add that part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| and then I don't think we should stipulate the parameters of what skills we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| One thing that we could do is put that it is one member who would prefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| you know, it's preferred that they have this type of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| It doesn't have to say shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| because then what we're indicating is the type of people we're hoping to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| but it doesn't limit us to only having that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| I can compromise with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Take the word shall and do preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Our charter states that you can serve two four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| As an elected official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| David, are you listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| The charter states we can use two four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| We ran into this on BZA, where the BZA says two two-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| I think it was four years total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Which of this one here we said three years is the term limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| Which is, well, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| are we going to follow the charter that says two four-year terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| or can we do the three-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| Speak into the mic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| This body can do what it wants with regard to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| because you're appointing this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| It's like a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| You can do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| The four-year term thing, and I'll look it up here so you can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| and get you a specific answer to what the charter says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Clearly, there's four-year term limits for the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| That's me, that's commission, that's the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| But let me look that up and get you a specific answer with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| committees and boards, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| I'm fairly we'll definitely get a confirmed answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| but I'm fairly certain we have different other boards that serve one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| appointments, two years, three years, so I think it's as we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Well, I want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| While we're here, let's clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| On page two, everyone, down where it says, number one, personnel officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| the very last sentence says if the personnel officer is to be drawn from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| among the employees of the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| the designation of the personnel officer shall be made by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| Since the sheriff is really not having anything to do with the merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| as far as keeping these personnel records and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| should that sentence even be in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Well, that sentence has been in there for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| Fifty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| The commission shall provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| This is F, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| This is Division 2, Section 242 to 53, F, personnel officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| The commission shall provide for the designation of a personnel officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| who shall be the keeper of the personnel records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| If the personnel officer is to be, and that, who is that person now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| That person is actually Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| It's Paula, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| To give a little background, Paula and I were discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Blount County is the sheriff appoints because they don't have a Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| They don't have a merit system set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| So they don't have a Paula, so the sheriff, Sheriff Barone, will appoint that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| So in this case, the commission, us, have provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| have designated a personnel officer as Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| and then if it says if the officer is to be drawn from amongst the employees of the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| then the sheriff would decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So essentially if commission doesn't assign a person that role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| which is the executive director, then the sheriff does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| Am I reading this correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| Yes, this arises from the rule that's already in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| where somebody from the sheriff's office is appointed as the records keeper there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| That's in the present rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| So there's no change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| The question is do we need a sheriff doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| since we all have our own paid merit council personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| I would suggest that we focus on the changes that are already proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| versus bringing up new topics that may require a lot more research and debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| This is something we can always amend and adapt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| and I'm worried that if we start talking about new things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| that we haven't been talking about for the last eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| then we're never going to get to the things we have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| So I don't think it's a bad suggestion by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| I think it's worth talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| but I just don't know if it's what we want to pick off today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| I'll put a double star to that, a triple star to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| and we'll come back in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Commissioner Durant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| I have a small request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| As we go through this, can we just go in order, like A, B, C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| like through each exhibit so we're just not jumping back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Okay, so let me just continue on the rationale document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| So I did the first three, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Increases the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Further describes the term immediate family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| This is taken from other language, and it includes grandparents and in-laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| This is common language in other of our boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Outlines specificity of no compensation for board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Just like our other governmental bodies, this codifies that these are volunteer positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Defines the process and authority for changing the rules of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| This is per the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Since the county commission is the governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| essentially they can't change their own rules without bringing it to us for being voted on and codifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| and it must all the internal rules have to come to commission before going into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| It adds language that the merit system representatives will participate in the training of the covered employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| This was directly from our discussion about making sure that they had a seat at the table during the orientation sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3507)|
| 0:58:35| Requires ethics training of each member, much like other boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| and appointments that they must go through that ethics training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| So it looks like we've got a few of these to go over, obviously, and everything's sublotted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| So do any of these come from anyone else or mentioned from merit council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| or was this a collaborative effort, or was it just you, Chairman Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| It's a combination of the special committee and the law department and the review of the ordinance after 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| And also some of these are from also suggestions as we went through things with the council staff and some of the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3556)|
| 0:59:23| But I was just wondering which ones come from the specific entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| like that from a legal standpoint Director Boot feels like needs to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| from the merit standpoint, you know, Ms. Taylor feels like needs to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3574)|
| 0:59:39| and which ones you feel like needs to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| and what's more pressing, because I don't know, you know, just looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| I don't know if all these are going to go, are we going to redo the ordinances altogether for first reading this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| This is just number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| So we split them into, instead of having everything as all one, we split them into four different pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| Can I again suggest that we go back and we start at A, then B, then C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| instead of going through a whole ordinance and then opening it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| like let's just start with employee's merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| We've already discussed the changes in A and B, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Is there any input on the size of the merit council being five members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| Are we only doing it because other counties are doing it, or what's the basis on changing the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| Well, for me personally, three is never a good number for any kind of committee or council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| It's a much broader spectrum with five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| I think five is okay as long as we definitely change that shall on those parameters to prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| or even just get rid of it all and change that number to just five because we had four people apply for two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| And there were no parameters for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| And it's truly this body's job to vet the people that get appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3668)|
| 1:01:17| There should be really no parameters on what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| And I'll go ahead and say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| I think a lot of the problems we're having right now is because this commission, not so much this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| but past commissions haven't owned the responsibilities to the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| So we've talked about A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| We've talked about B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| I'm very comfortable with changing the word to preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| I do think it's an important notion to say these are the types of skill sets that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| I think it will help to have people that have law enforcement experience being on a council that works with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| I think it's important and it would help to have people that have HR or legal experience to help on a board that deals with HR and legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| So they don't have to be requirements, but it certainly would send the signal that these are important things to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| I just want to bring up that we had that opportunity, and we did not vote for a law enforcement person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| We have down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| So we've talked about A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| We've talked about B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| The terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| I've got something in terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| This is C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| The terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Voting members shall serve the staggered three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Voting members may be appointed for a shorter term to create a staggered term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| No voting member of the merit system shall serve more than two consecutive terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| Non-voting county commissioner of the merit system council shall serve a term that coincides with either her term or the office as a member of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| Members and alternate members of the merit system council serving of the effective date of the ordinance from which this subsection derives shall continue to serve until their previous established term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3772)|
| 1:03:03| meaning if new goes into place, everybody's grandfather did, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| The county commission may remove any member for cause upon written charges and after a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| The term alternate member is still listed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Where's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Next to the last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| The members and alternate member of the merit system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| That was just a oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| We'll remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| I go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| I have a question on the non-voting county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| This is what we ran into on the ethics committee where it says his or her his or her term of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:40| So, for instance, if Carson gets elected on September 1st, Carson gets elected on September 1st, or I mean, you know, August, sworn in September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3820)|
| 1:03:52| and he goes for four years and then he's reelected another four years, that means he would serve for eight years the way this is worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| And we need to make this to coincide the way we do the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| And that's how Commissioner Durrett got the opportunity to serve on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| Do you know how the language differed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| I think it just said the initial term or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| We can add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Add or add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| It only served one term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| We can double check that with Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| I wanted to talk about this last line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| The county commission may remove any member for cause upon written charges and after a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| That seems like quite a hurdle to go through whenever we are in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Should that line be struck and just say the county commission may remove any member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| Director Book, that would be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| I think that would be more appropriate because that's the way it is on every other thing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| You can remove any member at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| The only one it ever had that I saw, and it was a state law thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| was that on the Board of Health you had to have a show cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| But everything else, this body, this body has got to realize you are the boss of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| And so you can pick and choose and get rid of committee and board members as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| So is your recommendation, Commissioner Smith, to remove any member, period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| No, that the wording be the county commission may remove any member upon an affirmative vote of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| So we are still under C for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3941)|
| 1:05:53| Moving on to D, qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| This changes the time in which somebody is eligible to serve as a member of the council from five years to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| Again, putting it outside of the window of a potential administration that they will have worked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| and includes additional wording for what immediate family means, which is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| it was pulled from other language that the law department found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Wouldn't eight years also do that and reduce too to give us more of an opportunity for people that are retired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| Yeah, it just gave additional buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| I mean, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| I think it would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| You have got to think about the age of someone that served their time in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=3998)|
| 1:06:47| Are they going to be 65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| I think it was just a way to make sure you were outside the window of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| So I don't think eight or ten makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| If there's an opinion, I think it solves the same potential conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| I think so too, but it gives two more years of leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Does anybody have another opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| I like the ten years for the simple reason it will hopefully take the political out of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Other comments on D before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Is this immediate family the same immediate family that we use on everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Is it across the board the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Yeah, this came from the law department and looked at other wording and other statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| Is this something that we hold ourselves to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Yeah, this comes basically the wording from our ethics code, and it applies to most, like on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4056)|
| 1:07:48| So it's existing somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| E just defines that there is no compensation or salary for the merit system council members of the volunteer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4073)|
| 1:08:01| Comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| Do we want to limit ourselves to the possibility of never making these paying positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| We can change this at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| We'd have to go back and do another ordinance then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Well, that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| It's not set in stone, but we can change it down the road if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4096)|
| 1:08:26| This next F, this is the one where I feel like that's a bigger discussion with some more information that we need down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| That was a change from the law department, but I think that we can move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| G is powers merit system shall have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| I have one on F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| So it says the commission shall provide for the designation of a personnel officer who shall be the keeper of the personal records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| and the strike through is and shall serve as secretary of the merit system council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| So who would do that since that is struck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| The board would select it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| It's outlined in a different part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Jill and I looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| It's actually outlined in a different section where the secretary is already defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Just making sure that there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| It's presently in the present rules that the executive officer, which is Paula, serves as the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4158)|
| 1:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| It's in their own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| So who is the personnel officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| The executive director, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| The personnel officer is the executive director, which is Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| So we are providing for one by allocating money and having that person provided for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4181)|
| 1:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| It's actually the job title is executive director, but it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4196)|
| 1:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| G, propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Mr. Chairman, is that you wanting to change personnel officer to the executive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| If you think that's more cleaner to the job title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| It is because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| We can change that to executive director to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| It's already in there as executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| G, the powers of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| Number one is to propose rules and regulations for the administration of this ordinance to be submitted to the county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4229)|
| 1:10:38| So that is to essentially change this from them making their own rules and approving it themselves to they can approve their own rules and propose it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4238)|
| 1:10:48| but it still must come back to commission for codification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Are there other committees that propose their own rules and then we have to approve them as a commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4251)|
| 1:10:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Every committee and board that we've got comes up with their rules within and then they submit them to the full commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Even zoning ordinances that are initiated from MPC, we have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| I'm doing my best to look around, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| Number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Make investigations concerning the enforcement in effect of this ordinance and to require, some of this is just, that's language cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4282)|
| 1:11:31| There's a ton of these that after the law department looked at for 50 years, they just needed to be written in more modern language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Mr. Law director, words mean something here, so what's the difference from there under to here under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| I would have to defer to Ms. Jill for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| She is my grammarian and I don't know anyone better, so that was a change that Ms. Jill made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| That's just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| You know, words, when it says shall, you've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Where they're under changes to here under just brought my attention to why, so maybe you can get Jill to, we'll get, I'll ask Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4321)|
| 1:12:10| Just ask Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Your grievances as classified employees in accordance with the definition of grievances as set out in section 42 to 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4334)|
| 1:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Where are they listed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| 42 to 67 is under recommendation number four, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| Let me double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| Yes, so ordinance change proposal number four, and I'll direct this to Director Buch for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4369)|
| 1:12:59| So we can, yeah, maybe we talk about, I mean, when we get to that, this is essentially saying you've got to see that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4379)|
| 1:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| So that's number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Number four is language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| I believe that's a language cleanup grade and step under salary progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| See how that's outlining how they write it in the law department or in the legal HR language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4402)|
| 1:13:30| Five is also language cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| Six is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Seven is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4417)|
| 1:13:45| I went on number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Yeah, it says keep any other such records as may be necessary for the efficient and proper administration of the office of Knox County Sheriff and the office of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4430)|
| 1:14:04| Paula, correct me if I'm wrong in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| Why are we got efficient when I'm pretty sure they're efficient anyway, but how it would be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| The only way that the merit system could keep records of the Knox County Sheriff is to rely on the sheriff's office to make sure they got the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4455)|
| 1:14:25| So who's going to be responsible when Paula or whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Our merit council don't have the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| It is going to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| If I if I'm reading this correctly, David, this is number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| It probably was meant to be written the full off the office of the merit system for the employees of the Knox County Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| I believe they're just trying to get the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| This would be page three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Yes, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| And I think that was some wording that you came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| The rules all already provide for the record keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| You could get into the mic a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| I was looking for the precise rule with regard to record keeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| There's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| As I recall it, just without going trying to find it right now, there's a lot of inter twining between the sheriff and those personnel records in the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4516)|
| 1:15:28| I thought they were pretty much totally intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| I think that we need to ask Jill about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I'm pretty sure it's a language cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| It's not a new issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Mr. Chairman, it's actually it's being added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| If you drop my opinion, if you drop and just it says the office of Knox County Sheriff Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4543)|
| 1:15:50| OK, I'll we'll talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Drop those three three words and I think we'll be clear on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| Mr. Smith, I want to go back to number seven real quick for some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| The language has been struck to assist in the determination of dismissal or for cause and for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4561)|
| 1:16:10| Where did that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Is this number seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Where did that that language come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| And also, is it not a good idea before termination is made to go to the merit council to see if it's going to wind up in agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| It doesn't say the merit council gets to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| It says to assist in determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| If somebody is terminated, they clearly have a right on appeal to the merit council and a merit council is going to have to have a record of why this person did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4601)|
| 1:16:55| and their entire record for them to make a proper decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| And I think that's what this is trying to say, because those clearly fall under the protection of the officers and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4619)|
| 1:17:08| So there have got to be records for the merit council to review when there's a hearing before them on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| Yes, but that's an issue of after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| This is before the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| If you're going to terminate somebody, I just wonder why it's such a bad idea to weigh in with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4641)|
| 1:17:32| To weigh in and see if it's going to cause a problem before you take an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210715-chairmans-briefing?start=4652)|
