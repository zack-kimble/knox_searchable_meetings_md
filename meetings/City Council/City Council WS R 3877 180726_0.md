| 0:00:30| Let me call this workshop to order, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| And ask Councilwoman Stephanie Welsh to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=35)|
| 0:00:43| Please stand if you're able and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=46)|
| 0:01:07| Well, I thank everybody for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| This is part of the ongoing study of looking at our codes from the 70s and considering updating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=70)|
| 0:01:21| I think everybody that I see out here is probably pretty familiar with that, so I'm not going to make any remarks about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| except now to turn it over to Gerald Green, the Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| Oh, I'm sorry. We need to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| I'm out of order already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=98)|

| 0:01:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Well, now, my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Now, Gerald Green, Executive Director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, if you'll walk us through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders and City Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| I'd like to start by acknowledging the fact that this is not a single-person effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| The staff of Camaros have worked hard to provide us consulting services that led to the creation of the second draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=128)|
| 0:02:18| We've also had assistance from MPC and City staff, some of whom are here from MPC, Amy Brooks and Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| City staff has been led thereafter, has been led by Peter Ahrens, with a lot of input by Chris Cuccaro and the city legal staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| and our administrative vice mayor, Dr. Bill Lyons, Becky Wade, Aaron, and Ann Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=155)|
| 0:02:47| Aaron, as I've noted to some folks, has inspired us with her enthusiasm and pushed us at times to create a better product, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=167)|
| 0:02:58| We also have assistance from the Public Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| Councilwoman Welch is the council representative on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| Other members who are here include Matt Sterling, Pat Phillips, Jennifer Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| The Metropolitan Planning Commission will have a great role in this, and members of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Pat Phillips is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| He's the Planning Commission representative on the Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| Matt Goodwin and Charlie Thomas are here, and I think I've gotten everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| And over in that corner is the city engineer, Jim, who provides a lot of input in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| Again, it's a cooperative effort, and I appreciate the fact that I get to work with such a great and talented team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| As I stated in an e-mail I sent yesterday, I see this not as an opportunity for me to do a lengthy presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| but for you to provide comments and input to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| In order for this effort to be successful, you will have to approve it at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| And your comments at this point and direction will be critical to ensuring that we create a product that is supported by a city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=246)|
| 0:04:16| What I'm going to do is go over the policy issues first that were identified during the review of the first draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| based on comments from staff and from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| Then we'll look at some of the significant changes in draft two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| and then with the guidelines that were developed for creating the draft zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| I'd like to note that the second draft of the updated zoning ordinance is online on the recodenoxville.com website at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| The draft map will be available August 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| The mapping has been a great undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| I'd like to thank the MPC staff, Tim Coon, Alex Zendel, and Nick Schoenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| who have played a great role in that and spent a great deal of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| With that, if it's okay, I'll go over and start with the first policy issue, accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| Accessory dwelling units are identified as a permitted use in the RN1 and RN2 single family districts with limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=311)|
| 0:05:21| There are some limits on the size with regard to the maximum square footage of the accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| It cannot exceed 40% of the size of the principal dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| With draft two, there has been a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| The size of the accessory dwelling unit is related to the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| The larger the lot, the larger the accessory dwelling unit can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| up to a maximum of 40% of the size of the principal dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| There are some standards with regard to the location of the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| You can only have one accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| That provision has generated comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| There are supporters who agree with the city and MPC staff that providing for accessory dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| will create more opportunities for availability of housing in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| and we hope through that to address some of the affordability issues that have been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Also in the second draft, we revised the setbacks to be 8 feet from the interior side line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| and 10 feet from the rear property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| With that, I'll stop, and that's a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| But again, the key purpose of this meeting is to hear comments from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| I'd be happy to answer questions or listen to your comments and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Any comments from Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Director Green, in the second draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| and I hope you'll recognize that all of the Council members received this yesterday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| so we've had less than 24 hours with the second draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| So I agree with you about having some opportunity to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| but those questions may be a little limited today because of the hour at which we received the access to the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| But with respect to ADUs, are they still allowed by right in all residential zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| The only change you made there was then for limitations on size and location of the entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| The only changes that were made were the relationship of the size of the ADU to the lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| and the setbacks, increasing the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Was there any change with regard to the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| and the availability of attached versus detached accessory dwelling units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| No, both are still permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| It was my understanding from looking at some other cities that were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| that had accessory dwelling units, that Nashville actually separates those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| and has accessory dwelling units that are only attached in residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| and single family residential only areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| And I could be wrong on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| but just wanted your thoughts maybe on whether it would make sense to have some differential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| for whether it's attached or detached based on the type of residential area we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=508)|
| 0:08:37| My immediate response without studying that at all is that it would not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| I think that would put some folks out of the opportunity to have an accessory dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| to be able to reuse an old carriage house in a more historic area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| a garage in a newer residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| To limit that just to having it within the home at the principal dwelling unit itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| would, I think, create limitations beyond what we desire based on the policy direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| and the opinion of MPC and city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| And then I wanted to address something else you mentioned regarding ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| which was with regards to affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| When you install one of these accessory dwelling units in a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| and you're renting it out or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| what kind of an impact does that have on the value of that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=571)|
| 0:09:38| I have not studied that and would have to study that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| I would think that it would slightly increase the value of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| but I can only speak from personal experience on that, not from any study or research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| And I say from personal experience, and I'll just take this as a disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| In my home, I have a separate apartment with a separate entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| I know when I purchased the home, I did not pay much more for the home because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| And I'm not trying to put you on the spot there, Director Green, at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| but I would think your assumption is probably correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| It probably does increase the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| It now has an income stream that could potentially be coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| and certainly has more space available than it did before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| because you've now got another living area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Okay, and I'll make that argument when I'm ready to sell my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| This is in advance so you can use that in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Well, my question then is if we're looking at affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| as a reason for having accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| doesn't that push more people out of being able to afford homes in certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| because the property value for a property that's been enhanced in this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| wouldn't that, it would increase and may drive more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| to not be able to afford to live in those areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| My opinion, and based on observation in other communities that have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| the incidence of accessory dwelling units is so limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| I don't believe it would push people out of an area, a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| because all the values of the homes would not go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| and the value of that one particular home may go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| My question is does the value go up enough to actually impact the revenue stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| Would the revenue from the accessory dwelling unit more than pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| for the increased mortgage payment each month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| And that's a question that we'll have to do research on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Are there any changes relative to the owner living on the property where the ADU is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| No, there are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| And so can you kind of go over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| What are those requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| There's no requirement that the residents be owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| And one of the reasons for that is the challenge in enforcing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=713)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| So just sort of a follow-up to Councilman Roberto's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| and this is more of an observation maybe than a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| but it seems to me like we may be sort of talking about two issues in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| One is about housing ownership and the other is about housing affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| And so rental housing is part of an affordable housing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| And so having the ability to have additional housing availability seems to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=754)|
| 0:12:42| and I have not done the research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| could potentially provide more affordable housing availability in the rental market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| although it might also increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| We haven't done the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| It could potentially increase the cost of housing ownership for that particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| while also providing an affordable option for rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| That seems to be the argument the research leans towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| and in fact an article sent to the Zoning Public Stakeholder Advisory Committee today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| made a strong argument that increasing the availability of housing at any level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| improves the affordability of housing and makes it more affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Throughout our entire city, there appears to be several of these units already here throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| You mentioned the house you purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| I know of things out south and certainly in Old North and Fourth and Gillins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| and even in my own neighborhood and West Hills and Sequoias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Do we have any idea what the existing inventory of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| or could be even carriage houses that are available to be accessory dwelling units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| We don't, and I'm going to defer slightly to Peter Ahrens to see if there's any permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=849)|
| 0:14:19| And one of the challenges is because they're not permitted currently in our single-family districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| I don't know how mine was built and has a separate meter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| but I'll ask if Peter knows of any permits or has any numbers because I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| Peter, if you would please just give us your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans, Review, and Inspections, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| We only issue permits in zones that allow for more than one dwelling on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| so these that are historic or not, I won't use that term, but that are preexisting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| we generally don't get involved with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| People don't ask us to come and perform inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| I don't have a great answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Well, of course, most of these, or at least the ones I'm aware of, have been there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| They were not built recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| They were either part of the original home, which may have been built 50 or 60 or 70 years ago or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| Any other questions from Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| So, Mr. Green, can you comment on the differentiation between an accessory dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| or a mother-in-law suite that's kind of a duplex, like the one you've described, not to make yours an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=938)|
| 0:15:47| but there's basement apartments or that type of structure or a rear apartment type thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| versus an actual separate structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Are we treating those differently in terms of accessory dwelling unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| What we're treating differently is a duplex or two-family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| as opposed to an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| The key with an accessory dwelling unit, and it could be, as in my house, a walk-out basement unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| or it could be, as in your neighborhood, a carriage house that's converted to another dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| I think we have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| And the difference is that in an accessory dwelling unit, the size limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| the square footage of that accessory dwelling unit cannot exceed 40% of the principal's dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| So if your principal dwelling unit is 2,000 square feet, your accessory dwelling unit can't exceed 800 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| With a duplex, typically both the units are the same square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| They're often identical to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| But in the example of like a basement apartment or a rear access apartment that's carved off of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| they're not necessarily the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| I mean, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| And that, the basement apartment carved off the back would typically be an accessory dwelling unit because of its size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1026)|
| 0:17:16| We would consider it an accessory dwelling unit subject to the standards of the accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| So it doesn't have to be a totally separate structure to be in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| No, it doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| It could be, again, a basement apartment or it could be a garage that's converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| So it could be either attached, meaning that it's, for example, the basement apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| or detached is the garage converted to an accessory apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| I do, I think I need more information and understand better a couple of comments that we're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1065)|
| 0:17:54| we decrease the cost of overall housing or we increase affordability if we have more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1074)|
| 0:18:03| But then we also, if we take properties and have accessory dwelling units like cottages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| there are examples in different neighborhoods where we have different apartments and flats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| that increases the value of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| In my experience, I find that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| And then that decreases home affordability or real estate affordability for some when you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| And so I'm kind of concerned about the two diametrically opposed factors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| So just something I'm thinking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Okay, and we'll do research on that and get answers from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| Any other questions or comments at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Sorry, I should probably just let this go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| But, I mean, it does seem like there are a lot of factors that go into affordability and the economics of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1137)|
| 0:19:05| And, you know, again, just another factor maybe for exploration is that if the housing value is higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1145)|
| 0:19:15| yet there's also a revenue stream that goes along with that higher housing value, the ownership costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1155)|
| 0:19:24| but there's a revenue stream, it seems like that also offsets the, you know, sort of the cost burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1164)|
| 0:19:33| So that seems like another factor that plays into housing affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| Councilwoman Welch, that you may increase the cost of your housing, the purchase cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| but you have a revenue stream that helps offset that with your monthly mortgage payment being supplemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| or paid for partially by the income generated by the accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| We'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Furthermore, if you don't mind, Gerald, you know, furthermore, I mean, I'm just imagining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| and again, this is theoretical, but I'm sure that I can imagine this happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| I own a home, and I'm at a point in my life where I may not have the same income from a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1211)|
| 0:20:22| but would be able to afford staying in my home if I were able to rent out my basement apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| So it just seems like there's more complexity to the economics of this than there are just lots of different factors to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| that seem like they would play into the affordability of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| And even beyond that, and I'll use myself as an example again, you know, with the basement apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| we thought about a daughter could come live in Knoxville and stay with us while she's getting settled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| or the in-laws who are tired of Ohio could come live in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| So not only do you have that affordability, but also maintaining a family connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| and almost an intergenerational family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| So I think that provides lots of opportunities for people, and it is very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| It's not a single option, and there's a lot of thought that has to go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| Mr. Vice Mayor, I'm going to follow up with one other question, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Director Green, in your experience over the last ten years or something like that, and we can change the time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1283)|
| 0:21:37| but how often have you seen neighborhoods that are zoned R1 or R1E moving to R1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| so that they could have these same kind of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| And I can't answer that because I've only been here three years, so I have not had that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| I'll talk about an experience in another community that 20 years ago adopted ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| that allowed accessory dwelling units, and in the first year there were a half dozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| and I was in a position in that community to know about them for another five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| and there were probably 10 to 12 maybe at the maximum a year, so it was not overwhelming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1335)|
| 0:22:26| and that was in a community that now is experiencing real challenges with affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| I believe the number has creeped up now because of the issue with availability and affordability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| Well, and the question isn't about the number of accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| I guess in your tenure, how often have you seen neighborhoods that were currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| or at that time zoned R1 or R1E move to R1A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| I don't think we've seen entire neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| There have been isolated rezonings from R1 to R1A, but not neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Have there been anything that, I know you said isolated neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Have there been instances of something like that occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| There have been some rezonings to R1A, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Okay. Where have those taken place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| That I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| And I know this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| With 50 cases minimum on our agenda at NPC each month, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| Well, if you could get back to us when you had those examples of those occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| but I guess the takeaway is that there haven't been neighborhoods that are zoned R1 or R1E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| that have made a move to R1A in your experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Not neighborhoods, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| All right, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| The next issue is duplexes or two-family dwellings in the R1 or RN1 and RN2 zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1430)|
| 0:24:02| The first draft and the second draft continues to identify those as special uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| in the R1 and RN1 and RN2 zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| As special uses, they would require individual review by the Metropolitan Planning Commission and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| That approval would be at a public meeting, noticed as required for public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| There are some design standards for them with regard to entrance location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| location of windows and doors, how garages are sited and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Again, that would be a use permitted as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| and would require individual attention and review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| There could be additional conditions applied to the approval as part of that approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| to address concerns or issues in a particular neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| but based on the need and the growing awareness for maintaining housing affordability in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1500)|
| 0:25:10| and the opportunity that allowing duplexes or two-family dwellings in some of those zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| would allow for providing a different level of diversity and affordability in single-family neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| that provision remains in the second draft and it has generated comment both positive and negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| I'd be happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1529)|
| 0:25:37| So, Director Green, in this use on duplexes, is this also permitted in all residential zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| It's just there's a special use that needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| It is not and I just want to make sure because I received the second draft yesterday also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1548)|
| 0:25:57| I want to make sure and look at the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| My recollection is it would be permitted as a special use in the R1, RN1, and I'm going to read through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| It's permitted as a special use in the RN1 and RN2 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| There's a permitted use in the RN3 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| It would not be permitted in the established neighborhood district as a special use or as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1579)|
| 0:26:31| Other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| The next one is incorporating the hillside and road stop protection plan recommendations into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| The initial draft ordinance did not address the hillside and road stop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| The ordinance, both the first and second draft, proposed the elimination of the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| That use on review process, one of the criteria conditions for approval is that the project proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| apply with all adopted plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| So that use on review process provided an avenue for implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| and enforcement of the hillside and road stop protection plan recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| With the elimination of that process, the hillside and road stop protection plan remained a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| That's a feel-good document with no means for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| There were concerns about that that came from all sectors of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| about the need to protect our hillsides and our road stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| The hillside and road stop protection plan was adopted in December 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| A lot of work went into it, and it's the opinion of staff that those policies should be codified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| And the second draft does apply those standards, limitations on the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| and limitations on the amount of the site that can be disturbed or graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| With that limitation increasing as the grade increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| it would apply that to all residential zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| We have done a preliminary mapping of the hillside and road stop areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| and the undeveloped ones are located primarily in residential zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| So that is recommended by staff, city, and county as a policy decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| and we are proposing that in the second draft of the updated zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| Any questions or comments about hillside ridge top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| All right, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Got to keep up with my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| The next one is additional standards for landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| The first comprehensive and uniform landscaping standards in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| were adopted as part of the updated parking ordinance last October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Those standards required landscaping for parking of more than 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| There were some gradations within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| The buffer from the street could be reduced for parking on areas of 10,000 to 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| Then they reduced from 10 feet to 6 feet at 20,000 square feet of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| The buffer from the street was 10 feet required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| There were also requirements for interior landscaping with runs of more than 15 parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| requiring a median and intermediate median with planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| There were comments from some sectors of the community that those standards should be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| to require landscaping for parking areas of 5,000 square feet or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| basically cutting in half the threshold for requiring those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| I would like to add that the landscaping standards proposed in the updated zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| also require buffers between residential and non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| If it's a non-residential use such as a church or school in a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| there's a requirement for a 10-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| If there's a non-residential zoning district adjacent to a residential zoning district, the buffer is 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| So there are additional landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| There's some site landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| The opinion of our staff and our policy direction is that we look at the impact of those proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| and existing landscape requirements before we reduce the threshold and require more landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| We're uncertain at this point with fairly new landscaping requirements what the impact will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| in terms of both adding to the aesthetic and environmental quality of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| and also the cost of those from the development side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| So we would like to review those and assess the impact of the proposed standards before we increase them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1856)|
| 0:31:05| I think we've made a pretty significant leap from going from no comprehensive uniform landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| to requiring landscaping basically for almost all non-residential development now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| as proposed in the draft zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| So the recommendation is that we keep what we have, assess it, and then revisit it at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1881)|
| 0:31:29| So that is not reflected in the 225 pages we got last night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| The different standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| The standards remain the same from the first to the second draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Any questions or comments about the landscaping requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| And I'd like to, before we go on, I'd like to apologize for not getting you this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| Vice Mayor Saunders and I set this date for this workshop last month, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| We were trying to find a date that would work, that wouldn't push it too far out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| and would enable you the opportunity to review the second draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| It turned out that revising the first draft and addressing some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and a number of smaller ones took longer than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| And I don't want it to appear that the consultants didn't do their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| because they worked hard through the weekend to incorporate the latest revisions and comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| from city and MPC staff into the draft and get it to us yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| So I apologize for the timing not quite working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| but as I've found, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| So again, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Now the off-street reduction in off-street parking in pedestrian-oriented districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| The city has a policy of trying to promote more intense development along our corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| and reuse older commercial areas, encourage redevelopment of those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and encourage pedestrian activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| And we've had lots of challenges with parking, as I think some of you are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| in some of our older commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| The development pattern that existed when these properties were initially developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| as much as 80 to 100 years ago did not anticipate the use of vehicles that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| We're slowly moving away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| but those parcels are often difficult to redevelop and provide the parking we required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| We have created what we hope will be used more, some pedestrian-oriented districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| The Neighborhood Commercial and the Commercial General District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| particularly with the Commercial General 2 and the Commercial General 3 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| And what we're proposing is a standard reduction in the off-street parking in those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| scaling up as the pedestrian orientation of those districts increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| The CG2 is the least pedestrian-oriented of those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| We're proposing a 10% reduction in the off-street parking in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| a 20% reduction in the CG3, which is more pedestrian-oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| and a 30% reduction in the Neighborhood Commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| which we anticipate being very pedestrian-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| That we feel will help the development community in developing and redeveloping sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| and the surrounding community and enhances walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| and increases the viability and the excitement of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| when there's less land devoted to parking and more to actual building and retail or service activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| To give you an example of what those zoning districts are and where they might be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| the Neighborhood Commercial, the 13th Street Market in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| is an example of a Neighborhood Commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| CG3 would be Broadway from the edge of downtown up through Broadway and Central and even to Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2107)|
| 0:35:16| Maybe CG3, I believe, up to the Broadway Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| CG2 would be sections of Broadway from the Broadway Shopping Center on north towards Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2121)|
| 0:35:30| and the Fisher Tire, back to the Fisher Tire location at Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| But that's our approach to trying to deal with some of the parking issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| and we realize there may be some unease with that in that I may come park in front of Marshall's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| and walk to Central Flats and Taps to take advantage of the public parking on History| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| and the lack of parking at Central Flats and Taps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| but that is one of the interesting dynamics of living in an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2165)|
| 0:36:15| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Stair's house, not Marshall's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| Well, that in effect happens now, of course, if you go to Central Flats and Taps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| and I'm sure in other instances, especially in Old North and Forth and Gill and those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Any questions or comments about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Marshall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Actually, he opined on this a couple of years ago on a piece of property right across from Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| right across from Broadway Carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| That issue came up that they were wanting to open a bar or something there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| and there were three parking spaces and the requirement was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| I think it comes up every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| It comes up a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| I guess my only question is do you think this would be enough to really make a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| Ten percent? I mean, 20 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| Why not waive the minimums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| I'm all for that, but I think we may get some pushback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Trying to put something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Actually, we put something out there to see what comments we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| This idea came up fairly late in the review of the first draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| so we'll look at it some more and try to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Is this enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| And also see what type of response we get on this from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| Is there acceptance of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Is there a willingness to go further with the parking reductions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| Right, because essentially what we've been doing since I've been on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| is just rezoning property to C2, which doesn't have any parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| I mean, that's, I'm trying to think, and there's variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| but that's sort of, if you look, C2 is around Fifth Avenue and Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| I'd have to take a look, but there's no parking requirement at all for that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you. Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Okay. On to Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| The first draft of the updated zoning ordinance proposed eliminating the Downtown Design Review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| incorporating some of the more objective standards in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| and having all downtown projects and their design approved administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| Heard a number of comments from a wide variety of people who are involved downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| from Downtown Design Review Board members to developers to architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| who stated that the Downtown Design Review Board process worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| It allowed for some creativity, the negotiation and discussion was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| Based on those comments, we recommend and have incorporated into the second draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| the return of the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| We have identified two tiers of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| One is a staff-level approval, which would be for minor revisions, alterations, signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| meeting objective standards. Those would be approved by staff in a more streamlined process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| Major alterations, additions and new construction would still go to the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| We feel that would, again, inspire that discussion, that creativity and the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| for some dialogue to occur around the design of new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| But that is reflected in the packet we got, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| Was it discussed or looked into whether the board could look into demolition downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| We did not look at that, but I'll make a note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| I'm trying to remember, because they used to look to get a demolition permit downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| They had to be approved by the Downtown Design Review Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| but I'm trying to remember, I think that changed maybe for legal reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| I know if it's in, I believe Market Square or some of the local historic district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| if it's in a local historic district, there are some provisions for demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| or delaying demolition, but we'll take a look at it more broadly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Don't we already have an ordinance on the books that council passed, the last council passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| to limit demolitions if it's older than 50 years, period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| It's a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| I believe that was several years ago. Dr. Lyons may be able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| I guess my question is, Councilman Stair, what is it you're suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| demolition be part of the approval process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| Right, to get a demolition permit, it would have to go through the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| I think the only way we can, I'm Bill Lyons, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| The only way we can deal with demolitions, my understanding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| either through the two zoning designations that limit, that prevent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| which would be NC1 and H1, and we do have some properties in downtown under H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Downtown Design never did have the ability to prohibit demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Legally, the decision, that discussion did come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| You're correct, Councilman Stair, but the law department opined that that wasn't anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| that they had the capacity ever to do as part of their enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| that permitted that type of board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| All right, let's move on then to providing opportunities for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| As you are, I'm sure, well aware, the discussion of affordability of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| has become more widespread throughout the community over the past few months and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| And zoning plays an indirect role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| Zoning can't dictate the cost of housing, the price of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| In Tennessee, local governments cannot require a certain set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| or amount of affordable housing as part of a new development ordinance or a new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| Zoning can indirectly influence the cost of housing by increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| or decreasing the availability of properties for residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| What we've tried to do with the new zoning ordinance is increase those opportunities for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| I'm going to go over those, and I appreciate the thoroughness of former Councilwoman Carlene Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| in reviewing things because she pointed out some things that I did not get quite correct in my wording here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| so I want to update those, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| She is looking over your shoulder right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| I wrote this before I got the second draft, and to be quite honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| after reviewing the first draft and lots of discussions, sometimes I wasn't sure what we agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| I'm glad the consultants, by the time we got to the consultants, we were all sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| The places that we've really worked to increase the availability of housing is along our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| The corridors are Magnolia, Chapman, Broadway, Central, Kingston Pike, even Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| which we don't often think of as a place for housing, but all the commercial zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| and the zoning districts that will be applied to those corridors will allow residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| So there's a great opportunity for increasing not only the opportunities for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| but we think the affordability of housing because they're along transit corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| and people who live along those corridors could take transit, and with the mixed-use character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| maybe even walk to their place of employment or walk to places to obtain services and goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| There's an exclusive multifamily zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| There are N7 districts, and by exclusive, I mean it only allows multifamily developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| It does not allow single-family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| It does not allow commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| We're working hard and worked hard to find places to map that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| to identify areas where we want, as a city, want housing and want multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| The lot size in the RN2 district has been reduced from 10,000 square feet as proposed in the first draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| to 7,000 square feet, reducing the amount of land required to build a home in that zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| thereby, we hope, decreasing the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Townhomes are permitted as a special use in the RN3 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| The two-family dwellings, as we noted, would be permitted as a special use in the RN1 and RN2 zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| and the accessory dwelling units would be permitted as a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| in all the single-family residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| Again, what we're looking for, working towards, is a comprehensive approach to increasing the land available for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| and hoping about increasing the opportunity for housing in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| where we have some impact on the affordability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| Questions, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| Councilman Roberto, you look poised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| I think I covered this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Let's move on, then, to the zoning of older, undeveloped industrial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| We noted in the mapping process, primarily, we were aware of some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| before we started mapping and tried to create tools that would address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| There are older industrial areas undeveloped from the Standard and Ending Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| That is a massive building that's remained undeveloped, and we need to provide opportunities and tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| to at least encourage and permit the redevelopment of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| to places like Humbert Place where there's some industrial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| the edge of Oakwood-Lincoln Park where the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| there's industrial zoning that may not be appropriate for industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| because of access, the character of surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| So we've looked in the mapping process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| We've tried to look closely at those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| We have the Industrial Mixed Use Zoning District now as a tool proposed in the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| The Industrial Mixed Use allows industrial manufacturing uses, retail uses, and residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| all in that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| So applying that to places like the Standard and Ending Mill Complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| so that it creates or provides an opportunity for a wide range of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| and hopefully encourages redevelopment of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| We're being more selective in mapping of those industrial zones that were just placed along the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| Anywhere there was a railroad, it was zoned industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| regardless of the access or the impact on the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| So we're looking closely at areas like the edge of Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| the edge of Oakwood-Lincoln Park and trying to map those areas so that there is a use permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| but the use of those currently industrially zoned areas does not impact the surrounding neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| and maybe provides more opportunity for things that the city may need more, such as housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| While maintaining the industrial zoning for those areas that are viable industrial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| and that are currently used for industrial purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| we've also tried to address the need for more creativity and entrepreneurship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| and what is called the maker community by allowing craft industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| which is an industrial type use that does not exceed 8,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| in all our commercial areas except the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| Questions? Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Wow. It's a shy bunch tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| All right. Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Now, do you want to go over the major revisions included in draft two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| I'm going to go through that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| I would note that in the second draft, it's redlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| Things that are to be deleted, items to be deleted are noted in red with a strikethrough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| New wording additions are in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| I try to make it easy to go through the 225 pages and find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| And this is a nightline of those uses or changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| There were some changes in the use matrix with regard to the uses permitted or not permitted anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| One of the comments we heard fairly consistently throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| was that the office zone is a transition district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| Restaurants and retail uses should not be permitted in that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| because they could have a significant impact on the adjacent residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| We've deleted that as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| We've identified additional opportunities for some social service-type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| Domestic violence shelters are permitted in more areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| Drug and alcohol rehab centers are a necessity, and they're permitted in more areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| We made some divisions or revisions to some of our zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| What was called the office industrial district is now just office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| We realized we needed to place a category for large office parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| We changed the name and deleted the manufacturing uses from the permitted uses in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| We've created an institutional district to accommodate hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| and educational facilities with large campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| We've got some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Again, I noted in the RN3 district, we've deleted multifamily as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| and keeping townhomes as a special use and single-family and two-family as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| In the RN2 district, we've reduced the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| And those policy issues that I described with regard to the changes in the parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| the incorporation of hillside and roadside protection plan recommendations have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| I'm sure that discussion will continue of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| but I wanted you to note what the major revisions were and be able to identify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| And also, again, the changes in the new ordinance are either in red or blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| with the blue being additions in the red and strike through those items that are deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3078)|
| 0:51:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| City of Knoxville zoning map update and guiding principles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| I'll go through these briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| We had guiding principles, and then we realized how challenging some of those principles were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| when we got into the detail of the mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| But one of the things we tried to use consistently was a vision for the future versus the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| We had a plan or a policy that said this is the way our city should develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| and that impacted the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| We looked at that and used that as the guiding light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| We also tried to, in the residential districts, we used the lot size as a guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| in assigning the residential zoning category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| The validation of the existing use, making sure that the use that's being made of the property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| consistent with the current zoning, would continue to be a compelling use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Our goal was to limit the creation of nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| Uniform zoning of properties, we wanted to try to avoid split zoning as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| Split zoning is when a piece of property is assigned two different zoning categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| We went into this thinking that we would not split zone any properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Then we found a number of properties that were split zoned for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| A portion of the property was zoned commercial, the rest residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| When we looked at the topography of that, often that part that was residential was a steep hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| so we maintained those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Or the property was split zoned to provide a buffer between a heavy commercial or industrial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| and the adjacent residential, so we maintained those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| Even though we had a principle, again, that seemed good as a theory of eliminating those split zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3186)|
| 0:53:14| when we got into practice, we found it necessary to maintain them in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| Designation of corridors, we wanted to try to smooth out the zoning categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| By smoothing out, I mean have one zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| If you look at our zoning map now, for example, Kingston Pike starting with Western Plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| by the time you get to North Shore, we've used pretty much all our commercial zoning classifications in that short area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3214)|
| 0:53:43| What we're trying to do is, if it's CG along a corridor, maintain that CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| We may, again, looking at Broadway or even Kingston Pike, go from CG3 to CG2 to just plain CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3228)|
| 0:53:57| but maintain the commercial general classification because the uses remain the same, the differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| And CG2 and CG3 are some increases in intensity in exchange for some design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| to make them more pedestrian friendly in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| But those are the, and we did not try to implement policy changes through the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| That's something that we'll do later if there's a policy change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| I think the one instance looking at Councilmember Campin is in Oakwood and Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| We do have a council resolution to look at the single family designation of that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| so we did implement that, try to implement that policy change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Our older residential neighborhoods, we tried to discuss quite a bit because of the mixture of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| and residential types in those, how to zone those older residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| from Old North to Park Ridge to Oakwood, Lincoln Park, and we have settled on our N2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| and we are awaiting the community input as we go out for community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| I'd be happy to, any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| Okay. Tutorial on assessing and commenting on updating zoning map online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| This will be available next week, but I wanted to show you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| I'll send this PowerPoint to all of you so you'll have these references| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| and it will be on the Recode Knoxville website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| We want to provide this tool to access the zoning maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| We know that not everyone will be able to use this tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| but we feel most of the community would have access to computers and hope they take advantage of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| because, again, our staff has worked hard to create this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| What we'll do, my computer will, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| Again, the draft map release is August 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| We'll be receiving feedback for a month to a month and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| with the draft two of the map to be released in the fall of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| We'll have what we think is a great tool, an interactive map on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| You'll be able to see both the current zoning map and the proposed zoning map side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| You can zoom in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| If you zoom in on one map, the other map would automatically zoom into that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| so you can look at a sector of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| You can go down to an individual parcel and see what the current zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| and what the proposed zoning map is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| We're working on a tool that you can pop up both the current zoning and the existing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| to not only see what the classification is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| but read what the permitted uses and the standards in those two zoning districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| There will also be a map feedback form that you can select your location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| and either a zoning district you can put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| you want to look at the RN1 zoned areas and the standards for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| and it will highlight all the RN1 zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Or you can put in your home or your property address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| and look at the proposed zoning of that area and the standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| And then there will be a comment form that's computerized that you can enter your information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3439)|
| 0:57:28| and we have some standard feedback classifications or you can come up with a general one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| and those standard ones are up there that the recommended zone does not permit the current use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| that the recommended zone is too intense, it's not intense enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| the loss of existing use right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| it's inconsistent with the sector and one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| or you support the recommended zoning district and the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Again, we feel this will be a good tool for the community and there will be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| Yes, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| You may be segueing into the list of the public meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| I don't have that, but I was going to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| I wanted to note that we'll have several different opportunities for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3492)|
| 0:58:21| The maps that you can comment on, there's the RECODE website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| which has a submit a comment provision on that or application on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| or you can email RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Now on to the community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| There will be four community meetings that we're coordinating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| with the City of Knoxville Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| In the last two weeks of this month, they're in different sectors of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| There's also, we're working, one thing that we're excited about is working with the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| and I forgot to introduce Terrence Carter as a member of the, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| as a member of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| and we're working with Terrence in the Knoxville area, Urban League, SEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and Central Hispano to get out into what are typically underrepresented sectors of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| when it comes to policy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| There will be, they're coordinating three community meetings at Burlington on August 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| that's a week after next, on Thursday, August 9th at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| and the Vestal Community on September 10th at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| and the Five Points Community at the CAC East Neighborhood Center on October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| All the meetings are on the Recode Knoxville website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| In addition to those meetings, I'm meeting with a few organizations, Amy Nolan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| and I imagine Jennifer will help her with this, Jennifer Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| I'm meeting with the Chamber of Commerce on, I can't remember all these dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| but we'll be meeting with those, I'm meeting with a group of architects to go over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| One thing that we're not doing is responding to calls from individual neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| The major reason for that is that we don't have the staff to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| There are basically two MPC staff who are dedicated to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| We also go to city council meetings, county commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| PZA meetings, a number of other things, and there are only so many hours in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| And also we feel that by going to a meeting in a sector of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| that you avoid inbreeding, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| You hear comments that you don't hear in your particular neighborhood or community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| You hear them from other sectors of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| And we need to understand that this ordinance is not for one neighborhood or one community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| It's for the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| We need to be able to look at our city as a whole and address the needs of the city as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| not the desires and the wants of one neighborhood or community, but the needs of the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| We feel that dialogue that we hope will occur at those larger meetings will be fruitful in achieving that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3661)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you. I guess was the design standards, were those debated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| Did that come up as an issue or what was the feedback on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| It was unusual because we didn't get much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| I don't know if we didn't go far enough, but the design standards that we have are pretty minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3688)|
| 1:01:38| You have a front door facing the primary street that you have a minimal amount of windows that you use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| Try to maintain a uniformity of materials and wrap around the portions of the building visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| from the public right-of-way for commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| So they're not overwhelming standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| There are some limitations on use of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Compared to the current form-based code in South Waterfront, how would you compare them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| Because one person said this is an effort to make the whole city like the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3727)|
| 1:02:16| The South Waterfront and Cumberland standards are much more intense than the general standards in the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3736)|
| 1:02:25| in the proposed zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Like ten percent of that or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| Maybe nine and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| Again, that degree of standards for the form of the building in the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3756)|
| 1:02:45| and Cumberland Avenue form codes is not present in the proposed zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Other questions or comments by Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Well, Gerald, I think you and MPC and the consultants have done a magnificent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| And the city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| With a gargantuan task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| And we've still got some ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| But I think we're well on our way and we've gotten a lot of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| and there's plenty of opportunity for neighborhoods or individuals or organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| or developers or whoever to make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And so I'm sure you will continue to make yourself, not just yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| but the whole organization available to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| I just was going to ask for an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I am looking at the recode website and, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| the community meetings are scheduled through October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| What is the overall time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Are we on track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| We're on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Maybe a week off with the second draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| We had hoped to have it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| And, again, I apologize for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| But there are a lot of last-minute comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| I want to again thank the MPC staff and the city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| We had a number of meetings, long meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| to go over every line of the draft one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| And our opinions were not always uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| and we had to reach compromises and explain different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| So, again, I appreciate the time and effort of the city and MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| and the effort of the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| But the schedule now is for the third draft to be available late October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| and we're hoping maybe a bit before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| And some of it will be guided by the number of comments we get on the second draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| because if we get just a few comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| then it's easy to make the revisions and create the third draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| But if there are a number of significant comments, it will be tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| We'll have a review of that third draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| and then hope for adoption late this year, early 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| And with the third draft, there will be another round of public meetings and comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Other comments or questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| There is nobody signed up for public forum, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| Nobody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| So I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you, everybody, for coming, and we will keep moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| I have some flyers for the community meetings that are being coordinated by the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| So if people want those, I'll pass them out to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| But please let everyone know that these community meetings are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| There will be a great opportunity for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| And what we want at these is more discussion, less presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| We appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180726?start=3953)|
