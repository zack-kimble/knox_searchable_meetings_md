| 0:01:01| Without objection, go ahead, Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=62)|
| 0:01:12| I'm running for the President of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| I'm a bipartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| That's why I didn't wear orange, but I wear neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Clearly, I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| I've been living in Knoxville total 38 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| I'm not like other foreigners, other newcomers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| I've been here, East Tennessee, 38 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| Dr. Kim, by the way, would you give your address and also say one or two things about your endeavor there in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=103)|
| 0:01:52| if you would, for the people that do not know of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Well, I'm Dr. Tom Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| I run a free medical clinic in South Knoxville, and I have three other free clinics in Bryceville, South Knoxville, and Oneida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=117)|
| 0:02:11| And then next month, we're going to open another one in the Morgan County, SunBright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| So and another one I spoke to in Knoxville, Oak Ridge, free medical clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| So total about five of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| The reason I'm here, because 60 or 50 million Americans don't have insurance, but they're Americans, citizens, and also they're working people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=147)|
| 0:02:38| 1993, I opened this because we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| In order to come to my office, you have to have American citizens or hold green card papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| And then you must work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| However, our economy is down recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| I broke my own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| If a person lost a job within six, eight months, I'll get to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| So far, we have seen more than 10,000 patients, but if we included from 1993, it's over 50,000 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=182)|
| 0:03:11| And literally, you must be very surprised if I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| We clinic saved $15 million last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| That's a huge hit for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| I appreciate Knox County government support our free clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| And I'm here because I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| I like Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| I've been here 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| And also, I went to Milligan College four years in Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| Total, I live in East Tennessee 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| If I don't, I won't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| And mainly, I came here for support to the Lamar Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| Last seven years, they've been helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| I did not ask for anything free ride, anything appetizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| But each time the patient comes in, I ask, how did you come here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| From what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| 30% wore their masks, like their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| And 30% read the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| And then 30% from emergency room, five emergency rooms in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| And then 10%, it's very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Now, a lot of youngsters are reading the Internet website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| It comes through the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| And 10% from doctor's office, and 1% some other way it come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| So I strongly support Lamar appetizing the billboard for free medical clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=277)|
| 0:04:46| And there's two advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Number one, there's serious disease we discover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Look at this sign in the past seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| And I like to tell this young lady, number two, the Knoxville is very busy transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| this area from north to south 75 and west to east I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| This is junction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| There are a lot of other state people traveling this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| When they cross through the Knoxville, they see this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| You know how many people they call me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| Hey, man, what a great Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| You guys have free clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| We, our city, our community don't have a free clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| Tell me how do you open this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| When you hear from this out of state, it just, you know, touched my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| And I'd like to close this, my presentation, introduce one lady who from Cincinnati, Kim Gaines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=336)|
| 0:05:47| She's 32 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Got a job in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| She felt one little lump in the right breast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| She's been asking all kinds of hospital doctors, office, and x-ray departments for mammogram and searching for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| And she could not get any help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| And waited four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| And then when she drive down here town, look at on the left side junction between I-40 and 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| On the left side, you all, whoever live in West Knoxville, they probably see many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| She saw this sign and then called my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| And the lady was the front desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| She said, Dr. Kim will see next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| When I exam, it wasn't that spectacular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| And I love about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| But I felt a little tiny size of a P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| But I sent her back to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| They did a free service of mammogram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| And then hour later, Dr. Kim, I want your order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| I just give her order mammogram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| It's very highly suspicious of cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| So I order for biopsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| And then 72 hours later, I got a malignant disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Now, by the way, her first name is Kim, like my last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| Kim, we'll take care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| We'll take your board and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| We've got to do other x-rays where the tumors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| It's going to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| But don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| We'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| I need a caregiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| I'm going back to Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| And my mom is going to take care of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| But you've got to see a doctor right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| And a month later, I have a beautiful lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| oncologist surgeon, lady doctor from University of Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| She did all surgery, all the nice letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| And then it's already publicized in the Cincinnati story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| And she's been sending cards and memos every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| the anniversary when we discussed cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=468)|

| 0:09:08| Dr. Kim, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Did I hear you say that they gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| they designed that for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Yes, they designed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| So you didn't call the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Well, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| We're not asking any commissioners nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| They just helped me because of what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Thank you, Dr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Ms. Feld, would you be ready to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| and start the presentations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| And then following Ms. Feld's presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| I assume Mr. Isaacs or the Lamar Company has a presenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| And you have following, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| but as part of your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| you want David Goodson also to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| We'll start the clock at 225 and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Oh, and by the way, the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| the public comment section, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| We're trying to keep those at five minutes if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Thanks, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I'm president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Scenic Knoxville strongly supports the three resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| In fact, we'd like to see these resolutions go further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| and place restrictions on the operating characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| of existing digital billboards and EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| We advocate a 60-second hold time for both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| prohibitions on animation, scrolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| and flashing, and controls on brightness levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| We're fortunate to live in a beautiful part of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| that's rich in natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| We have an obligation to protect this natural beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| for ourselves and generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Instead, we've allowed a crisis of visual blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| in many of our commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| We've become so numb to this clutter that too often we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| even see it and don't know that it can be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| We get used to ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Mistakenly believing that it's necessary for economic growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| we've allowed commercial interests to take over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| our public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Spaces funded by taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| The courts have ruled that billboards derive their value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| not from the private property they stand on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| but from the public roads they stand next to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Roads that we, the people, with our dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| build and maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| It's this principle that gives communities like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| the legal right to regulate commercial signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| and even to ban them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| Thousands of cities and four states have banned all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Last year, the state of Arizona banned digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| after a survey showed that 88% of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| didn't like them and didn't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Cities and states have done this without any loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| to economic vitality and frequently with a gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| In Vermont, tourism increased by 50% two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| after the last billboard was taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Beauty is good for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| A community that protects its natural beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| will attract people who want to live and shop there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| and high-quality businesses that want to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| More and more people choose where they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| where they want to live, then find a job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Billboards and digital signs are unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| They're designed to distract drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| to get them to take their eyes off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Billboards and digital signs in particular are dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| and cause drivers to take their eyes off the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| for more than two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| Studies show that when drivers take their eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| off the road for more than two seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| the accident rate increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| A few years ago, a bus hit and killed a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| at the corner of Gay Street and Summit Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| You know the corner, the one with the big scrolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| I wonder which one was reading it when the accident happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| The pedestrian or the bus driver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| And don't let anyone tell you that any study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| has demonstrated the safety of digital signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| because there simply aren't any scientifically valid studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| that show this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| And scientifically valid studies are the only ones that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Photos of bank robbers on digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| may be helpful, although hardly necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| But at what cost to public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| Would catching a bank robber be worth the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| of your loved one's life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| What's the trade-off here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| And don't be fooled by some of the arguments you'll hear here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Some members of the tourism industry will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| they have to have billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| But tourists don't come to see billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| So far, have you ever noticed that travel brochures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| never show billboards and digital signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| They know they're ugly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| and they know people don't like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| And don't be fooled by the supposed generosity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| of the outdoor advertising industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| that gives free billboard space to nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| They do this under two circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| First, when they know local governments, like ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| have regulations or bans and they need to buff their image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| and recruit supporters to their side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| Second, when they have a lot of empty boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| and something there looks better than nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| By the way, have you noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| how many empty billboards there are around town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Maybe it's due to the economic downturn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| but maybe businesses have found other avenues to serve them better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| like GPS systems and social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Maybe billboards have become outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Unfortunately, though, once up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| they rarely come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| And we don't need a study committee to look at these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| This is just another delaying tactic of the outdoor advertising industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Their hope is to be overrepresented at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| so they can get an outcome that's more favorable to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| an outcome they want to label as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| Just listen to the people, the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| They'll tell you how they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| They don't like these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Too many cities have failed to preserve their visual character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| They've lost their sense of culture, history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| and uniqueness of place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| contributing to a sameness in their appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| So many of our major thoroughfares could be any place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| in any city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| In Knoxville, we only have to note the success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| of the revitalization of our downtown and Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| to understand the appeal of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| that have a uniqueness of place and culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| When you're downtown, you know you're in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| When you're on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| you could be anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Recently, Gay Street was listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| as one of the ten best streets in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| That's quite an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| People want to live and work in a place that preserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| its character and its scenic beauty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| and tourists want to visit places that have these qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| We need to preserve these qualities in all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and passing these resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| will be one giant step toward that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| We hope you do it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| I'll turn it over to David Goodson now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| and following him, Julie Webb, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Commissioners, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Name and address, Mr. Goodson. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| David Goodson, 811 Cresswell Court in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I've been in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| since I came to school here in 1973.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| I'm a small business owner and a property owner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| I'm also a member of the St. Knoxville Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| I'd like to take just a few minutes to focus on one particular study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| that I think is relevant to your discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| and your eventual vote on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| and it's called Beyond Aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| How Billboards Affect Economic Prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| I think the importance of this is it's one of the few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| that I'm aware of that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| starts to put a number on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| what has in some ways been an aesthetic argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| not that aesthetics are not certainly important in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| and how they drive, you know, tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and business development in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| But this study goes a step farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| It's a very scientific study by an urban planner in the Philadelphia area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| named Jonathan Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| He published this in December of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Two important points here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and that is, one, that billboards negatively affect property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| and that cities with strict billboard controls are experiencing measurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| greater economic prosperity than cities with less strict controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| Snyder found that there's a strong correlation between a home's value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| and its proximity to billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| In the Philadelphia area, homes within 500 feet of a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| are worth $30,826 less at the time of sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| than properties farther away from billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| And that may seem obvious, I think, when you're in an urban area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| You know, if you had a billboard in your front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| your house is not going to be worth as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| But it went farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| It also looked at homes within a particular community or census tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| that are further than 500 feet away but where billboards are still present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| And they found that there's a decrease of approximately $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| for every billboard in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| For example, five billboards in a community such as Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| meant a decrease in the home value of approximately $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| That was in the Philadelphia area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| He also looked at 20 cities across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| These were varying sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Youngstown, Ohio, Austin, Texas, Charlotte, Jacksonville, along with some other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| And he found three things, that for cities with strict billboard controls versus non-strict cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| medium income was higher, poverty rates were lower, and that home vacancy rates were lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| So, you know, he didn't look at digital boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| I would assume that, you know, by extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| you could come to some conclusion that an even more broader sign would have a more negative effect on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| But I think, you know, the point here is that, you know, there is an economic impact to billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| They do affect the economic prosperity of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| And, you know, the idea, I think, that somehow regulation of billboards is bad for business is kind of an old idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| I think that billboards make a lot of money for very few people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| but they also can potentially bring very serious economic harm to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| I have this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I'd love to pass it to you, or I can welcome to e-mail it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| I'd like you to have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| It's very interesting, and I think it makes a very good point about actual financial impact of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Mr. Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Now, Ms. Webb, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| And I'm going to --Ms. Webb also has a time restraint, so I'm going to let her go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| and then the representatives of the billboard industry will have your presentation following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| Ms. Webb, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Ms. Webb, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Julie Webb, 562 Riverfront Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Thank you for this opportunity, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| As I wrote you, I urge you to support the ban on new billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| the ban to convert traditional billboards to digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| and the ban of electronic messaging centers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| A ban of these distractions and eyesores will be a forward move for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| In the recent past, three American cities that were voted most conducive to business, San Diego,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| Seattle, and Portland, Oregon, have all banned new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| and enacted tough on-premise sign control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| Several years ago, in the Nine Counties, One Vision study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| more than a third of several hundred persons discussing beautification urged better sign control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| Knox County is a beautiful area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| This is our opportunity to see that we preserve this beauty for ourselves and those who come to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1363)|
| 0:22:53| I was on the task force when the city adopted its sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| and I urge you to join the city of Knoxville in supporting the ban of new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| and electronic messaging centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you, Ms. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Now, for Lamar or the representatives of the billboard industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| if you're ready for your presentation, we can proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Do we have anyone to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1408)|
| 0:23:38| My name is Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| I reside at 10040 Casa Real Cove, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| I think the major difference that I would see from the folks that are making the presentation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| I don't see so much an intent for regulation as I do elimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| And I think that over time, if you have an ordinance that is inflexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| you're not going to induce anyone to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| You're going to have less inducement to take down the signs of the properties developed if they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| Dr. Briggs, for instance, the spacing that a lot of boards were built on years ago was 300-foot spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| Do you happen to know what the new spacing is on the primary roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| 750 before the prohibition, or I guess the last measure you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| Over time, as the property develops, if you don't allow them to be spread out, they're going to stay 300 feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1477)|
| 0:24:45| People make a free choice for the billboards to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| Nobody forces a property owner to put the board on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| So if they don't want to lose them, they're not going to be induced for a property developer to even want to spread them out further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| This is on primary roads, primary arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| So if a new permit has to be 750 from an old permit, it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Over time, over years, as property changes hands and property develops, they're going to be spread out further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1511)|
| 0:25:20| So I don't believe, though, that's what the opposition is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| I don't think they're wanting to see an evolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| I think they're wanting to talk about elimination, at least the folks that I've heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1527)|
| 0:25:37| I do have some photographs, and I'd like to bring them to you for just a second if I could, of what happens if you did eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1537)|
| 0:25:48| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| I'd like to bring these up if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Or you can hand them to Ms. Bonavita, and she'll pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1557)|
| 0:26:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1578)|
| 0:26:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| While we're getting this passed around, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| You referenced 500 feet and 750 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Three hundred was the primary arterials, primary arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Three hundred was the prior ordinance in spacing, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| The next ordinance was 750 for a new location, a new location, 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| And how does this relate to state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| State law is a lot weaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| State law has 100-foot spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| It's nonexistent, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Now, that's on primary arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Your interstate system is 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| And that's the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| And they can be as far as 1,998 feet apart, and one can't go in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| So they can be almost two-fifths of a mile apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| But you're going to find certainly 1,000 feet is the current standard for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1635)|
| 0:27:25| What happens when you take private enterprise out of outdoor advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| When you take free enterprise, when you take the ability for a private property owner to make a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| as to whether or not he wants to have an outdoor advertising structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| or I call it off-premise commercial speech, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Page one, you're going to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Scenic Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Private property owners can't engage in off-premise commercial speech, but the government does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| Is that what your ultimate objective is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Do you want the government to take over outdoor advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| These folks do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| So at what point do you stand up for free enterprise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| And at what point do you say, let's have regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Let's let the private enterprise, let's let private owners, private property owners benefit from this product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1697)|
| 0:28:24| We don't force people to buy our product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| You think Jimmy Haslam is going to spend money on something that's not going to benefit him or going to employ people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| Jim Haslam built his business on price strategy, on outdoor advertising, on the interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| Take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| Okay, that's Pellissippi Parkway, by the way, where I show you those first three signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| Private property owners can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| You couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Government can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| So when you're thinking about banning outdoor advertising, ask yourself, you know, what's going to happen next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| And if you're in a country where you think you want to support the government doing it all, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| The second picture is Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| The city of Alcoa has a ban on outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| What do you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| State signs on right-of-way advertising, commercial speech, advertising hotels, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1771)|
| 0:29:41| You couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| I couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Property owners can't benefit from lease payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| The government has done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Because what you don't understand is, in a ban of outdoor advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| you're not banning the people wanting information to go places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| You're not banning people making impulse decisions as they're driving down the road as to what they want to eat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| or what kind of gas station they want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| You have to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| So that's another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| A city's banned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| States built them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| And that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Lastly, I guess the last two pictures are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| pretty much the outdoor advertising has been demagogued by being aesthetically unpleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| One of the folks just mentioned a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Outdoor advertising is aesthetically unpleasing in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| Well, where in the world are you going to have commerce if you don't have commercial areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Where are you going to have the ability for people to sell their products and services if you don't have commercial areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| They're not going to be a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| And, Dr. Briggs, you mentioned how nice the Pellissippi Park would look in a newspaper article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| It's not zone commercial, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Except the pictures I show you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| I ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| You see the top of a new Target store there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| You see what that looks like on that page and the next page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| You do not see one outdoor advertising structure in either one of these four pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Should the product be the best it can be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Should you have fair regulations for it to be able to exist in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I'm 100 percent for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I happen to be on a rules committee in the state of Tennessee right now, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| looking at rewriting rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I'm for rules that promote a quality product that serves the public, that freely buys it, and freely responds to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1903)|
| 0:31:56| That's free enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Nobody forces people to respond to a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| They do it on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| Another mention a minute ago was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| There are other ways to communicate to the public, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| And I promise you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| When it's better for a businessman to advertise on social media than it is for an outdoor board, we're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| You don't have to ban us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| The free market has worked because there's a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Thank you, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| You still have about six minutes left of your 15 if you have anything else to add to the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| You've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I guess you do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| I'm sure we've got questions for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| So we've got one light on at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Okay, Mr. Smith, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Mr. Douglas, you gave us this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| You were talking about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I'm curious, how much does it, if I had a crystal, how much does it cost to advertise like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| I'm thinking like $1.50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| Anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| I'm not in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| I think they pay the state, I think, $1.25 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1987)|
| 0:33:15| So, what, $1,500 a year they pay the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| And this has got six of moments on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| And there's no spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And that's not commercial land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| And that's not industrial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| You can't go across the fence and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Yeah, thank you very much for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| Not trying to be critical or anything, but it was a very clever bait and switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| because we're not talking about eliminating advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| We're not talking about eliminating billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| We're talking about a ban on new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| And so the present billboards are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| We'll still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| And it's the same thing with Mr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| The billboards will still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| The old ones are grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| And that's one point I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| The other point I wanted to make, you know, particularly looking at these pictures on the top of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| I guess it's a Target store over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| We're not talking about banning on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We're talking about billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Billboards are defined as off-premise advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| The third thing is, is that we talked about there's no commercial development along the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| You've got a very good picture right here along the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| I happen to go off that exit every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| And the town center, that's where that Target store is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| and that's where some of these advertisements are, or these signs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| The town center certainly has commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| There's a Publix that just went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| There's a Target that just went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| And that's considered commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| There's no ban on on-premise signs, you know, right in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| And just the final point again, we're not talking about eliminating signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| The issue that's being brought forward with this are three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| And I think this is important for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| And I was going to mention it to Tom Kim because he's a good friend of mine also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| We're talking about the ban of new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| There is no ban on existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| That's one part of what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| The second part of what's being proposed deals with the conversion of existing billboards into digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2127)|
| 0:35:36| And then the third part of this is electronic message centers, which are a little bit different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| You know, I'll concede that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| But I do want to point that out to the other folks that are here is that this is not an elimination of outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| This does not address at all on-premise advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| And it only deals with new billboards, digital billboards, and new electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| All the old ones, including the digital billboards, would still be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| They would be grandfathered in under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Mr. Douglas, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| First of all, I really didn't intend to bait and switch you, but I appreciate your compliment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| All I was trying to show you is that over time, sir, if you're not allowed to adapt, if you can't adapt to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2178)|
| 0:36:28| there will be fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| They will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| It would be like if I said, okay, no more physician's offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| Eventually, there's going to be no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| And all I'm telling you is that you can have good control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| You can have good regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| You can control the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| You can control the quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| But if you just say an outright ban on relocations, I would suggest this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| I'll bet you there's probably not a handful of legal locations left in the county right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| If you go on current spacing laws, not a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Certainly not marketable because all the good spots will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| But over time, if you don't allow them to adjust to the marketplace, sales of property, development of property, yes, they will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| There really is a demand for this stuff out there, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| People do buy it voluntarily and pay pretty good money for it sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| With regard to the ‑‑I just did that for aesthetic reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| I just wanted to show you there's not any outdoor boards in these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| It's a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I don't particularly think that's scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And thirdly, this outdoor is not on Pellissippi Parkway except one part between Kingston Park and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2263)|
| 0:37:54| There's not commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| There's no C zones where I think the scenic area on Pellissippi Parkway exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| You see a beautiful ‑‑my home, I see the mountains from pretty much the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| I know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| We can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| We can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Not until someday, maybe, if they decide to put businesses up and down the highway that need advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2296)|
| 0:38:25| that will go to the state government will certainly give them signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| So, anyway, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| I think he's coming back for you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Come on, let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| I just had a couple of other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| It's like you usually do when you're talking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| You think there's something you wanted to say after you finish saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| But I did want to make a couple more points on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| is that even where those pictures were taken where you get off to the town center where the target is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| that's not Knox County's jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| That's the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| They annexed that a long time ago for the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| And the third point I wanted to make is that if you really look at Knoxville over the last 10 or 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| most of the development downtown that Knoxville's had, most of the development in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| has been with a ban on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| And you also see that those businesses that are downtown are advertising on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| They may be, but they don't advertise in Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And that's my point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| We have billboards in town right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| We're not talking about eliminating billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| We're talking about the expansion of new billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| or allowing new permitting of billboards outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| But it is those businesses have been able to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| and expand with the present ban on billboards in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And I know we've gotten several e-mails from business people saying, let's don't do this to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| It's already been done in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| And we're talking about Knox County, which is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| And just for some people who may not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| what we do in the Knox County government does not have anything to do with what they do with the city of Knoxville government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| The city of Knoxville government has already done what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| And what we're doing is just bringing the regulations and the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| and the permitting in line with what the city of Knoxville already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| I think we've had a sort of a test trial now of nearly 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| And we found that it really hasn't hurt business in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| And we've also seen that actually, if anything, if you look what's happened in the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| and the previous years before that, is that we've had really an explosion of business within town and with tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| and all these other things that are being promoted by the advertising industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| Mr. Douglas, and then we've got to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Once again, the business is downtown Knoxville advertising, outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| All you've got to do is write on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| And one of these days, and one of these days they'll be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| But this ordinance is not proposing to take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| And many of those signs that you see along the interstate are in the city of Knoxville because of the annexation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Knoxville did many years ago for their tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| If you don't allow them to expand to the new laws further apart to adapt to the marketplace, what's the end result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2485)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| And now we'll go to about seven or eight people that also want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| Let's start with Marcia Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| And all these, if we could limit them to less than five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you, Ms. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| My name is Marcia Greve, and I live at 3640 Escagna Drive in Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| And I have lived here about 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| I appreciate the opportunity to address the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| I'm speaking to show my support for Commissioner Briggs' three resolutions regarding new billboard construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| digital billboards, and EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Four years ago, I was part of a similar effort in the city, which currently has no digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| At the time of this effort, our group asked for a map of billboards in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| and found out that we had approximately 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Had the city of Knoxville not banned new billboard construction back in 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| please imagine how many more billboards we would now have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| My first question to you is, how many billboards in a community are too many billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| And where do you draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Right now, five major county corridors and entrances to our city are blanketed with billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| Chapman Highway from the south, Clinton Highway from the north, I-40, I-75 from the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| I-75 from the north, which is not quite as bad as the other areas, and Alcoa Highway from the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| Thankfully, there are some exceptions on Alcoa into the city, which remain green and billboard free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| Recently, the Knoxville News Sentinel published an article about the fantastic upswing in tourism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| that the state of Tennessee has had in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Our tourism numbers jumped 8.7 percent from 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| and put the state in the number nine position of the top ten states for tourism in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| Incredibly, all 95 counties in Tennessee gained, including 23 that topped 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| And in Knox County, our tourism growth was 8.8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| The economic impact for our state was a record $15.36 billion in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| Because of this, Governor Bill Haslam has asked for Tennessee to double down its efforts to attract visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2658)|
| 0:44:26| The newspaper also emphasized that Tennessee is a state, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| blessed with scenic mountains, rivers, lakes, and forests, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Knox County, in particular, is at a pivotal point in terms of tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| The Legacy Parks Foundation and others are promoting Knoxville as a city of greenways and outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2683)|
| 0:44:51| And it seems to me it is critical for Knoxville to do everything it can to preserve and enhance its scenic landscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2691)|
| 0:45:01| My second question to you is, how does allowing more billboards affect the traveling public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I work at the East Tennessee History Center, and I talk a lot to tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| Most of the people I talk to really enjoy visiting the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| They like our center city, our riverfront, our parks, our green hills, and our mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| How do they find accommodations, restaurants, and attractions in our area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| They research the web ahead of time or use their iPhones to get social media recommendations on Facebook, Twitter, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2730)|
| 0:45:39| Travelers today do not rely on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| My last question to you is, how do you want your community to look in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| Statistics that I mentioned earlier show that increased numbers of people are coming to Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| Fortunately, we have something to offer that visitors want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| Lush greenscapes and hills, lakes, scenic rivers, mountains close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| and a relief from the urban sprawl, traffic, and signage that many communities have too much of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| With the growth of tourism in Tennessee, does it make sense to increase the number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| and or bright, distracting digital billboards along our roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| and thus obscure our greatest asset, the beauty of our area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| Is this not counterproductive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I would ask commissioners to look closely at this issue and take the long view for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| Please, please bring a halt to billboard blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| and help us bring more tourism dollars and economic health to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you, Ms. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Okay, Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| Name and address, please, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you. My name is Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| I live at 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| And it's a pleasure to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| I really appreciate your addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| I am speaking on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| I'm on the board of the League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| The League has about 180 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| And in particular, I'm speaking on behalf of Jamie Dobbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| who is the president of the local league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| The League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County enthusiastically supports the proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| first, to prohibit new billboards in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| second, to prohibit the conversion of existing billboards to digital models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| or dynamic displays in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| and third, to prohibit new EMCs, electronic messaging centers, in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| The League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County has a stated policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| of supporting public policies and strategies that enhance community appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| and livability by, among other things, eliminating billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| While this is a sort of related matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| we do recognize that when appropriately designed and scaled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| on-premise business signs can serve a very valuable function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| In contrast, off-premise advertising signs adversely affect, in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| the local economy and the well-being of community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| They degrade our county's appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| And in addition, off-premise signs can be, even the static ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| can be distracting and dangerous for drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| But this is especially true of digital billboards with changing electronic images.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| And similarly, on-premise EMCs with animations or with scrolling and flashing messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| are not only unsightly, but they're also distracting and they're dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| So on behalf of the League, we applaud that the Commission has taken up this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| and we urge it to adopt regulations that will put these prohibitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| that are under discussion permanently into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| That's the end of my comment for the League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| I did want to add one personal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I've been very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| I've lived in Knox County more than 35 years, and I love it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| I also have the good fortune to share an old family place in Vermont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| with my brothers and my sister, and I get up there very occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I love both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| They each have an astounding natural beauty that comes from being in the Appalachian region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| When I come back, though, from Vermont, and I welcome getting home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| My home is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| But when I arrive back here and I come into the county, I come into Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| I come into the county, I see the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| It's a jolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| It's not a pleasant jolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And if I were to see even more and more billboards over time, it would be even less pleasant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| So I just wanted to share that personal, very vital experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Next, John Kohler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3060)|
| 0:51:09| Name and address, Mr. Kohler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| I'm John Kohler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I live at 5400 Crestwood Drive, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3074)|
| 0:51:22| I came to Tennessee in 1978 from Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| And I was, at that time, way back then, appalled by all the billboards I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| And I thought, you know, maybe these Tennessee people grew up under these signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| played baseball under them, and they think they're normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| But we know they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| I'm speaking of some issues that have already been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| We've all got Asheville envy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| We drive around the city of Asheville, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| We see those flowers and a lack of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| It feels good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| We've all got personal visual memories of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| We can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Talk about economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I know that places like Carmel, California, Hilton Head Island ban billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| I know that those cities draw money and moneyed people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| People pay a premium for places where billboards are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| They pay a premium for reduced ambient glare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| They're looking for control of ambient light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| And billboards represent the opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| Now, these digital signs, we all have an area on the sides of our brain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| about the size of a postage stamp, I'm told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| that is alert to changes in motion and changes in seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3189)|
| 0:53:19| And these digital signs are designed to activate that region continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| And I think that level of exposure over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| especially to residents nearby, has got to be unhealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| I have no data to back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| But our entire evolutionary past does not involve that rapid and frequent change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3221)|
| 0:53:50| I just don't think it's healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| And as for seeing the stars at night and having a night experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| if you live near those signs, forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| That's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| And actually, that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Thank you, Mr. Kohler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Hi, my name is Margo Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I live at 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane, which is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| I'm here actually not representing myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| but representing the Council of West Knox County Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| which has 37 homeowner associations located in Districts 3, 4, 5, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| And I really appreciate the commissioners who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| And I'm going to name you because there aren't enough of you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| And that kind of bothers me, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Commissioners Brown, Wright, Norman, Smith, and Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| I appreciate you taking the time and being here because this is a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| And whether you agree with what I say or what someone else says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| it's good for you to hear what different folks have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| That's the purpose of it, and I'm really glad that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| First thing I'd like to say is that we are absolutely not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| getting rid of any existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| That is not in the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| That's not to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| It's totally irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| What we are talking about is whether you, our elected legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| will decide if we have enough billboards, if we need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| The newspaper a week and a half ago and today reported that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| according to the Lamar representatives, Lamar has 78 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| Now, maybe they were talking about unincorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| I went on the Lamar's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| I gave you all a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| If you look at the 4,000 block of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| and you go out a 10-mile radius from that spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Lamar has 387 locations, and they have 851 billboard panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3373)|
| 0:56:23| And that is just Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| We also have Elevation, which is another billboard company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| We have Mr. Douglas, who has billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| We have Olympus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| We have Desmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| We have a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| We do not have CBS, and we do not have Clear Channel that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| There are a lot of them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I think we have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I think that's a lot of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| We know that there are empty surfaces on billboards, blank spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| We know that there are billboards that are donated, like to Dr. Kemp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| So I think we have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| And this particular question is, do we have enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| I'd say, yes, we have enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| The other question is, do we want to allow the ones we have to convert to digital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| Now, I sent you all an email about a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| and some of the images on it I found a little bit disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Because of First Amendment rights, it is not within the power of the billboard industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3447)|
| 0:57:35| to censor what is on their billboards other than what is allowed by federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| If it's considered obscene, if it is a message that is too close to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| there are certain issues that come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| I'm not really here to talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| because I don't expect you to try to control, you know, the content either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| However, if billboards go from static to digital, that's that many more images,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| and those images are controlled from another location, not from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| They're controlled if you go on any of the websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| Within an hour's time, a person who buys an ad can change that ad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| if it's on a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| That opens up a Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| I just want you all to think about that and do a little bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Digital billboards simply also do not allow more employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3512)|
| 0:58:42| The newspaper also reported and quoted the attorney that Lamar employs significant numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| They employ between 45 and 47 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Lamar is not based in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| It's not based in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| The headquarters are in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| They get a lot of money from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| We don't get that much money from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| The people who install billboards, I would wager, are the ones who would lose their jobs, not gain their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3546)|
| 0:59:14| The majority of Lamar employees here in Knox County, I would be willing to bet you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| get up on those ladders and install traditional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Ms. Kline, your five's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| I wish I had more because I don't represent myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| I'll send you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Jane Brannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3574)|
| 0:59:43| I actually am here to endorse Lamar Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| Jane Brannon, 400 Heather Moore Drive, Knoxville 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| I'm the Executive Director of Susan G. Komen for the Cure here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| Each year we have our signature event, Race for the Cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| It's coming up October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| As an affiliate of Komen, we're required to have less than 25% expenses in our annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| If we have more than 25%, we lose our affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| So as we sit down every year and we develop our marketing plan for Race for the Cure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| which represents 83% of our annual operating budget, we look at all of the opportunities for promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| We had a really good opportunity this year with the Department of Advertising at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| to sit down and use our campaign as the topic for their 401 class, their campaigns class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3638)|
| 1:00:47| And we asked them, what should we do differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| What blend of advertising opportunities should we incorporate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| And so over a semester of projects, we looked then and sat down and listened to proposals by the teams in their 401 class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3655)|
| 1:01:06| to review what we had done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| And I will share that we have used traditional means of print advertising, electronic advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| and out-of-home advertising, which would be billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| They came back resoundingly endorsing what we had done in the past with a little bit of a mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| because we're increasing our social media platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| But outdoor, as it has been in the past, has represented a very convincing platform for our Race for the Cure registrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3688)|
| 1:01:38| Since 1998, when we started with Race for the Cure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| we have put back $5.9 million into our 16 counties for breast cancer screening, treatment support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| and fund development, fund supporting for the women and their families who can't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| while they're undergoing their treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| So we help with rent, we help with mortgage, we help with gas cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| And this past year, we actually granted out through our community grant program $570,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| This is very important to us, and I'm here to ask that you consider reasonable recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| reasonable guidelines to the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Thank you, Ms. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| Keith Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3746)|
| 1:02:37| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| My name is Keith Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| I'm a senior account executive at Lamar Outdoor Advertising, 3009 Industrial Parkway West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| I only have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| When we were last here in the spring, a statement was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| and I think it's been a statement that's reoccurred from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Ninety-eight percent of people hate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I'm not sure of the specific study that led to that statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| If you'll allow me, I'd like to review briefly the accounts with whom I work that are local businesses in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| These are businesses, organizations, just like the Susan G. Komen Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| who have purchased billboards in Knox County in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| Please note not only the names, but also the diversity these businesses represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| and the local labor force they bring to the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| Barberitos Restaurant, Tom Hughes Real Estate, Cookout Restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| Christie's Spirits, Pest Ops, Dutch Valley Antique Mall, East End Liquor, Executive Inn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3810)|
| 1:03:37| Fagin Jewelers, Faith Promise Church, Fountainhead College, Hampton Inn & Suites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Ideal Image, Star 102, 99.1 Radio Q, Blue Sky Cafe, Harley Davidson of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3822)|
| 1:03:50| Surin of Thailand, Lehman Jewelers, La Quinta Inn & Suites, Lincoln Memorial University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| McGee Tyson Airport, Innovation Valley and the Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| The Great Schools Program, which just finished their wrap-up with their billboard program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| Nationwide Insurance Agents, TDS Telecom, MC Package Store, University of Tennessee Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| Premier Vein Clinic, Rural Metro, Applebee's, Realty Executives Agents, Rick's Music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| Rice GMC Buick, Salon Azure, Best Western Straw Planes, Super 8 Straw Planes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| Knoxville TVA Employees Credit Union, Tennessee RV, Breadbox, United Community Bank, Pilot, and the Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| And I want to mention two more that I find kind of ironic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| The Knox County Health Department, major program last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission over two years promoting the Smart Trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| 98% of people hate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| That must represent the 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| Please note these are just my personal accounts, not my personal ones, since I work for Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| not my personal ones, but they are the accounts that I deal with personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Lamar currently has eight other account executives who have completely different accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| representing dozens of diverse Knox businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Let me address something that was just said with the digital program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| That money does come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| I get paid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| And our general manager has the authority to cancel any message he finds inappropriate for this public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| So it's not coming from some town, some moon on Mars or Pensacola or Baton Rouge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| It's coming and being approved locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| Add to the numbers I just mentioned, the property owners who lease real estate to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| the local vendors who supply our businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| the dozens of community organizations who call us every year to donate billboard space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| the other billboard companies, our employees and families, here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| Where do we come up with 98%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| In conclusion, Knoxville is a unique community through which two of the major commercial interstates pass, I-40 and I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| We have a tremendous retail traffic generator and the 15 million plus visitors that travel through this way every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| on their way to Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| They're on their way, cash and credit cards in hand, and literally can spend large amounts of money in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| if Knoxville businesses have a way to reach out and grab those people and billboards make the most effective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| We would agree reasonably that regulation is not only healthy, but is a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| However, if you're only hearing a polarized argument that seeks to eventually have no billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| and extremely limited signage, we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| And I know of communities that have had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I've been in the business now 31 years, been in advertising 37, that did say no new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| And, yes, there are fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| So, yes, it does hurt the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| They do go away because you have development, you have other things that happen that cause billboards to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| So the argument that it's not about getting rid of new billboards is not necessarily an accurate one given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| Over my career, I've had the privilege of working with communities around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| We gained some reasonable consensus and healthy and durable ordinances were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Each side, ours included, has to be willing to openly address concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| and make sacrifice by a note from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| It can be done if the parties are willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you, Mr. Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Next is Ann Harter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4042)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you very much, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| I trust that each of you got a letter from my husband and myself last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| We've been concerned about billboard control since 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| Ms. Harter, also give your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| My address is 6004 Grove Park Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| Our residence is within the city, but we are Knox Countians, too, since 1953.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| We hope that the County Commission will vote to make permanent a ban on new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4082)|
| 1:08:11| A billboard ban will simply say that as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| we have enough billboards to meet the advertising needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| and it also says that we care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Flashing digital billboards are not only a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| but are contrary to our state's agreement, which prohibits flashing intermittent lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| It makes sense that the county and city should have consistent regulations on billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| and also electronic messenger centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| The billboard industry always wants communities to give the decision to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| a committee with the industry dictating regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Knox County deserves roadways that are not cluttered with more billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| For these reasons, I believe, for the aesthetic reason, the economic reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| tourism reasons, and safety reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| the visual and sustainable image of any community affects its quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4157)|
| 1:09:26| I hope as elected individuals and elected officials, you will vote no new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4166)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you very much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Thank you, Ms. Harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Next, Melissa McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4181)|
| 1:09:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Melissa McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| I'm here as a private citizen, and I grew up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| I'm very late to this issue to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| About six years ago, I passed a digital billboard at night along an interstate, and I was blinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4205)|
| 1:10:14| And I had my enough is enough moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| My garden club is a member of an association that has battled highway litter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| and billboard blight since its inception in 1913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| In the 1920s, it established a committee on billboard menace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| I love that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| There is a long history of advocacy to free our public airspace of visual pollution in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| And as Joyce said, once the billboards go up, it is very tough to get them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| I am hoping the county commission, after this lengthy moratorium, can realize that enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| The number of billboards we have is plenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Banning them now is not inequitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| And the detriment of new and more billboards outweighs any real tangible benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4267)|
| 1:11:17| Their downsides are well known, especially of digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| Massive energy use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| The safety issue of drawing drivers' attention from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| The desecration of our landscape, requiring cutting down of trees and ruining the scenic vistas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4289)|
| 1:11:40| I believe the Knox County citizens, your constituents, do not want more billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| I wouldn't put it at 98 percent, but I think there's probably a pretty clear majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| And this is really a pro-business stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| It is better to have a more attractive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| It's an improvement for visitors and citizens to be able to see the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| and the addresses on the business properties that they pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| and not have their viewscapes monopolized by huge, bright signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| So enough really is enough on the use of our public airspace and the damage to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| I hope you will support these three changes to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you, Ms. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Here we have two others that are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| And if you would like to speak after that, just need to come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| First, Jim DeRopp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4356)|
| 1:12:49| I'm Jim DeRopp, and I live at 4126 Maloney Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4369)|
| 1:12:57| I appreciate Commissioner Brown being here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| and I appreciate each one of you being here because, my gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| having to put up with the billboard issue is not an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| And to take your time to do so, I really value that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| I'm glad about two things that I just heard from the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Number one, they were able to confirm the 98% and actually name the 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| by name what that 2% is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| We're appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| The other good news I heard from the industry was that if you don't allow additional billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4413)|
| 1:13:42| the existing ones will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| Well, that's some good news there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| At least they'll be reduced and slowly atrophied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| I go out Alcoa Highway quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| I drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Alcoa Highway is the only one of our major arterials that is halfway presentable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4442)|
| 1:14:14| It's a joy to drive Alcoa well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| I may be stretching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| But think of one thing that I know every commissioner knows as well as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| that you go through Lakemont, which is that little area where they have or used to have some sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| It's just past Greenacres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| And you break out, and you have a vision to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| It's UT property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| My God, you say, is that beautiful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| I know they're creeping down from the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| More and more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| It would just take one billboard, wouldn't it, to mess that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| But they can't have one there because it's UT property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| And it's UT property that really, for some of the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| It's so difficult that it's hard to put up billboards totally up and down Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| and are we relieved about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| One of the reasons I like to live where I do is that I drive out Alcoa Highway quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| For 24 years, I guess I still am a professional city planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| I'm retired and been retired for quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| I mean, I was a consultant to many communities, over 100 communities in the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| many of them in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Most of them were small towns, and the city fathers, others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| and the leadership of those communities used to ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| What can we do to make our town more attractive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| And I said, It's quite simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| You have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Restrict signs and plant trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| If you will do that, your town will be more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| And it's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Neither one are high-cost items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| I'm so happy to hear that our mayor and council have hired an urban forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4574)|
| 1:16:23| So it looks like we're making some improvement on the tree scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| I'll just say a word about EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| And I commend Dr. Briggs for actually organizing this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4599)|
| 1:16:48| If I read the paper correctly, there's three principal issues that are up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| The digital billboards, I'm sad to say two of those are located in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| They're exciting if you want excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| But the EMCs are of a different nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| They are very cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| They're very open to changing technologies, changing technologies in electronics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| Who knows where those things are going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Let's just eliminate them totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| They bring about an intensity of glare that you cannot help but be attracted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| Walgreens hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| I guess CVS hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| What happens is, in the advertising business, two or three businesses get them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| and the other ones think, well, if I don't have them, nobody's going to see my sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| So they are a plague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| They are a literal plague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| So good thing to do away with those little jewels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| Mr. Durant, your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Do you have something else you'd like to add there to finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| I support the issues that have been placed before you, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| brought before the commission by Dr. Briggs, and I appreciate him doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Martin Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4699)|
| 1:18:29| And Mr. Daniel is the last person that we have signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| so if you would like to speak afterwards, just come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| I'm Martin Daniel, 1834 Duncan Woods Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| By way of disclosure, I am the majority owner of Elevation Outdoor Advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| but I come to you today mostly to talk with you about outdoor advertising from a consumer point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4728)|
| 1:18:57| We have a son who is four and a half years old who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| That's a fatal chromosomal disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| And my wife and I are interested in supporting research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| and increasing awareness regarding Duchenne muscular dystrophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| In that regard, we, among other things, we have organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| and we produce the Knoxville Beer Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| which for the past two years has been down at the Southern Railway Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| And we have elected to use outdoor advertising as the primary means to advertise this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| And it's been a phenomenal success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| I can say that I'm familiar with most forms of advertising, print, radio, TV, outdoor advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4785)|
| 1:19:53| and we chose outdoor advertising because it makes the maximum impact with the minimum amount of expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4793)|
| 1:20:01| And we advertise with Douglas Outdoor Advertising structures this year, sign panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| Lamar Advertising on our own personal signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| And the impact that it makes is absolutely phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| And I think that if you restrict outdoor advertising, I can tell you from a consumer point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| I want to be able to go where the people are moving and in the commercial areas that are near where they move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| So, in that regard, we need to be able to reach additional areas as they expand, as the population expands into those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4834)|
| 1:20:46| So, I urge you to be reasonable about outdoor advertising regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| I think that a ban is not a reasonable way to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| If you want to restrict or limit outdoor advertising, I think that you can do so without a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4859)|
| 1:21:07| You can increase the spacing between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| You can limit them to certain industrial or heavy commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| There are many ways to do this other than an outright ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| Would anyone else like to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4884)|
| 1:21:35| Sorry, I didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| My name is Dale Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| My address is 6803 Mundell Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| And I'm a small business owner here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| You know, you all are talking about banning billboards, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| That is my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| I pretty much build them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I'm an owner and an advertiser on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Most of these people, you know, that I heard talk today, they're pretty much, you know, retired already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| And, you know, this is my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| And you all are talking about taking my business away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| And the moratorium that's on right now, I don't really understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| I thought there was supposed to be a limited time that the moratorium was supposed to be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| And I just wanted to ask you all about that moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| You know, you all put that on, what, three years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Four years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| Is it not supposed to be like a six-month thing and then you all make a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| You know, that has really hurt my business this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| I build signs myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| I'm an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| And I do work for a lot of the people that's in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| I employ people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| And I think you all are making a mistake by banning them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| You know, I'm trying to grow my business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| And I do live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| And that's pretty much all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you, Mr. Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| We've got a couple of lights on here that might want to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Would you care to give your business name, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| It's Modern Outdoor Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| And Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Yeah, I appreciate what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| I'm not actually the only one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| There's a couple more independent owners that you all are really hurting by banning totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| And, like I said, most of these people are retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| They don't even have a job anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| And I do have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| And, you know, I need my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| You all are really hurting my industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| I appreciate what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Do you just build new billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| No, I work on existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| I do just a little of everything, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I work for Lamar and I work for pretty much everybody in this area, Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| You know, because one of the things that I have wondered, I wasn't sure how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| That's why I wanted to ask a question, is like when they're changing billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| like sometimes you might see the Chick-fil-A billboard and they'll change theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| and they'll change it from a Chick-fil-A to a, you know, Red Roof Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| I'm just making an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Is it your company that would go up there and tear down the old part and then put in the new part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| That's actually hanging the vinyls on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Yeah, we do the production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| We do all aspects of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| I build them from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| And, you know, I actually put the steel in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| And, you know, I do advertise on them myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| And I own actually 17 faces right now in Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| You know, I can understand your interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| But, you know, one of the things that I think we need to make people aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| because I really do, you know, I do have concerns about this on businesses like yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| and I mean that sincerely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| But if there is a conversion to the digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| is that what that means is that somebody could sit down in Louisiana as a graphics designer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| They can put stuff on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| Yeah, they'd have to build it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| But after that, the conversion to digital billboards is probably what would hurt your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| Well, it's actually helped my business personally because I do install digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| And, you know, it's really helped my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| I've installed most all of Lamar's digital billboards the last past four years, I think is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5112)|
| 1:25:19| And I presently don't work for Lamar no more, but they was good to me, you know, when I did work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| And, you know, they're a good company to work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| I pretty much worked for them for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| And I think it's just a bad decision to ban billboards period because it's just cut my business out totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5129)|
| 1:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| Thank you, Mr. Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Are there any other questions or comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| We have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| Okay, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| Yeah, my name is Danny Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| I live at 4704 Meredith Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| I'm a part owner of a business, a billboard business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| Like Dale said, there are several businesses that aren't as large as Lamar that are represented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| A couple of things that I've heard didn't really look to address the commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| And I would applaud you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| I thank you for having a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| After four years, some of you have adopted this, but we've waited a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| You can just imagine in your industry, whatever it is, if someone just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| we're going to pause it to try to make you go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| And I'll address a couple of issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| We've heard that there will be maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| I'm somebody that is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| I know how to wear a harness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Last week I climbed a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| I put a flex on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| If you get to the electronic messaging boards that may change the message out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| more than likely it will be here locally through the advertiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| But that board will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| The electricity will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| The panels will go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| So it will still need to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| I come to you representing my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| We entered this business just to respect those that are here that have been here for a short while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| and those that have been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| And I respect both sides of this thought process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| I'm representing my – so you know I'm not a fly-by-night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| My grandfather was born in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| My father was born in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| I was born in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| I've worked several businesses, jobs, to put myself through school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| Graduated from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Have done business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| I would submit that what makes East Tennessee great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| there are many states like Vermont that have beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| There are some that have higher mountains than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Some that have more lakes than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| But know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| The people of East Tennessee are what draw people to East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| And those are made up of individuals and subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| and there are those who work small businesses and there are corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| And we have to take all of this into account here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| And I thought we had four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| It was brought before us in hard economic times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| when we were just trying to adjust to what our economy was doing in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| and doing in our neck of the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| And we stepped out and we tried to make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| When, as I wear many hats, it was brought before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| Dr. Briggs, you felt it necessary to revisit the billboard issue at a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| Well, I've submitted to you, I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| and I've told you about boards that have been down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| We have the state that has told us in 2009 40 structures were removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| I submit there's probably that many that's been removed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Bill Pierce was pleasant enough to give me an account of how many boards had been put up since 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| 128 boards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| We don't know how many of those have come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| So we have to make a guesstimate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Well, I would say that what we have found is our economy, the American economy, has done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| You guys, through the evolution of regulations, you all have put in this body, this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| before you got here, have put into place some restrictions that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| It worked for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| It was hard on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| It worked for Scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| It was hard on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| There wasn't an influx of boards and there wasn't no new boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| So as we grew, we saw a few new boards come in to meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| Some came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| That's what's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| You've heard it at testimony here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| There are vacant faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Well, you all know in business, if you have a vacant face, you can't generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| You still have expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| At some point, you cut your losses and you take the sign down, not because you all forced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| but because we decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| But if that happens over time, there will be no boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| And those that are against billboards would applaud that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| That's what they're after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| I would finish on this and hopefully I'll get a chance to address it another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| I don't have any billboards in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| If you want to know why, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| Because prior to this moratorium, I couldn't find a location that was profitable enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| I couldn't even find a location to put one because you had a restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| and the state had a restriction and there were no locations that I could find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| I've been doing this 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| I know how to find a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| That's why there's no new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Why do we have a moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Why are you coming in and taking something that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| and coming out and trying to police something that doesn't need policed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| I think what it should do is fall upon you all to prove why there needs to be a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| why shouldn't there be a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| And I certainly appreciate you and I appreciate the fact that you would listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Thank you, Mr. Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Yes, Mr. Rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| Mr. Ammons, would you care to give the name of your business, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| Yes, it's Outdoor Displays, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| And I must disclose that this particular family has members that are at Tenova Health and Fitness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5477)|
| 1:31:26| Although we have not really discussed the pros and cons of billboard advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| I need to state that it's your brother?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| Yes, my brother, Russell, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| And if I could state for the record, that's not the only business that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| I'm a businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| I was a businessman prior to being in the billboard business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| And just like many, there are multiple businesses represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Any other who wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5516)|
| 1:32:06| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| Annie Lalonde representing Shoney's Restaurants, 9720 Parkside Drive, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| I think most of you should have received an e-mail that I sent to you over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| And Commissioner Briggs, thank you for clarifying some of the questions that I had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5541)|
| 1:32:30| But I do also have some questions, and I hope that you all can answer them for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| The first one is, as Mr. Ammons and Lamar and Mr. Douglas have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| there is a difficult time for them to build their business because of the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| What happens when a billboard comes down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| If it's fallen down from a storm or if it's been damaged, do you know what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| I'm asking the Commissioners, do you know what happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| Mr. Douglas, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Oh, he just went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Mr. Ammons, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| You used to work for Lamar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| They're not allowed to put them back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Tennessee state law says they're not allowed to put them back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| I challenge you to check into that because I think I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| We had a billboard that was damaged on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| and we had a very difficult time getting it reposted because of the hailstorms from a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5607)|
| 1:33:38| The second question I would ask you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| if the Tennessee Department of Transportation allows EOCs over the freeways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| how can they be unsafe to drivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| If the Tennessee Department of Transportation has installed EOCs over the freeways to give information to motorists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| if they're unsafe to drivers, why would the Tennessee Department of Transportation install them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| Mr. Briggs, I asked you that question and commissioners in my e-mail, but I didn't get an answer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| So I would challenge you to find that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| And then the third thing I want to talk about is Shoney's restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| We've been in this market for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| We're celebrating 50 years since 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| Unfortunately, we've had to close a couple of restaurants over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| And some of that is due to the fact that we've had some difficult time getting tourists to our locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| The cost of billboards is very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| We see a need for it, but we continue to advertise in the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| We ask that in our six Knox County locations, we rely on billboards to bring lucrative tourist dollars to our restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| This is our main source of advertising to tourists who travel through our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| As mentioned before, we are blessed with I-40 and I-75 traveling through our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| Their dollars help keep taxes lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| I'm going to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Tourist dollars help keep our taxes lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Dr. Steve Morris, associate professor and economist with the Department of Retail, Hospitality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| and Tourism Management at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| has often told the hospitality industry how valuable each tourist dollar is to our local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| by helping keep our local taxes lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| By removing billboards, this is the result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| More businesses would struggle or go out of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| as we have had to close two restaurants in the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| Some businesses would never even consider Knox County with the ability to do outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| Fewer people would stop and spend their discretionary dollars here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| and as a result, Knox County citizens would end up paying more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Because of the great tourism we have in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| their tax dollars through the hotel tax industry and by the taxes that we pay through being in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5763)|
| 1:36:13| they help keep our taxes lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| I think most of you agree that you run on no new taxes in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| By approving this legislation, I challenge you that you would be raising taxes for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| Finally, I want to say thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| It's a very difficult challenge that we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| We all want to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| And then I would leave you with thank you for all your support in visiting our Shoney's restaurants these past 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| And we certainly hope that you will come visit us again so that we can continue to stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| I was going to try to answer a couple of those questions that you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| One deals with the state and its definition is about when billboards can and cannot be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| And really what it says is there has to be more than 50 percent damage to the billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| Otherwise, it can be rebuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| And talking about the we do have some issues with some of the things that are government and quasi-government EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5831)|
| 1:37:20| I do think that even though it's a quasi-government organization down here at the corner of Summit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| and Gay Street, the way that thing scrolls by, I do think that that's a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| And we have some issues with the convention center and also with the UT sign right there on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| when you're heading east about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| But the signs that are over the freeways, for the most part, are static signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5860)|
| 1:37:49| What we're talking about is the electronic signs where they're flashing, they're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| And that's the ones that we're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| But do they not change, those TDOT signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| They do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| And they change quickly, less than six seconds if you would like to time them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| I think it's closer to about four or five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Thank you, Ms. Marlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| They're the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| They set the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| No, I'm saying it seems like they're the government and they get to set the rules and they get to make things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| But then we as private businesses shouldn't be penalized for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| But there's a lot of things that the government does that I disagree with, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| But I do agree with you on that one, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5914)|
| 1:38:42| Jill, do you want to speak also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I'm Jill Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I'm the Executive Director of the Knox, excuse me, we just changed our name, Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| My address is 7520 Hollycrest Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| I have to thank the whole audience here for referring to tourism and hospitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| and all their statistics this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| That's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| At least we're making headway and everybody understands that we are a vital economic driver in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5950)|
| 1:39:19| I do want to give you one other statistic concerning each individual household in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5959)|
| 1:39:28| Because of the taxes that we bring into the community, each household pays less or pays $367 less in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5968)|
| 1:39:40| And, again, Annie referred to Dr. Steve Morris from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| He is an economist and an associate professor at UT in the hospitality department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| And he does have other statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| One of the things that we do represent are over 9,000 employees in Knox County alone for the hospitality industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=5994)|
| 1:40:04| So to say that the billboards don't affect or don't employ or don't have anything to do with that many employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6004)|
| 1:40:13| that would be keeping those 9,000 people out of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| And these individuals do rely on tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| And tourists are the ones that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| They spend their money and then they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| We don't have to support them in schools or the roadways or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| So many of these tourists come to Knoxville by driving through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| And the signs, the billboards, they direct them where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| They welcome them to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| They spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| They allow us to have less taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| And then they go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| I know they appreciate Knoxville and that's why they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| But we do need to be able to direct them and give them opportunities to spend more money while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| We do support more regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| I think it would be short-sighted if a total ban on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| But to give regulations, give guidelines, I think there's an opportunity there for everybody to come to agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6067)|
| 1:41:16| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Thank you, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| Other people who wish to speak, come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6085)|
| 1:41:49| Hi, my name is J.R. Hirtwig, and I'm here basically representing Trademark Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| We're basically an advertising firm in Knoxville on 127-48 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| And we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| We don't own any billboards, but we're here because, A, it is in our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| And so, of course, we do care about what goes on in the advertising industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| To a certain level, you know, let me just say I don't expect many of the people here who aren't directly affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| or don't feel that they're directly affected by this issue to really care what we have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| those of us who are in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| Certainly, as a person, you know, I feel that I would love to have less advertising on television because sometimes I watch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6151)|
| 1:42:39| and it's usually not for the advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| I do sometimes go to businesses that I see advertised in various areas all over town and also, again, in any medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6163)|
| 1:42:54| But I don't think there should be a ban on allowing that expansion of those mediums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| and the way they are used for advertising, even as an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| Because, also, I think we are in, again, the United States of America, and many of us are small business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| people that may not yet be a small business owner but may wish to be at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| And advertising always has been and always will be a part of that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6197)|
| 1:43:25| You know, again, I understand many things have been brought up about what we are and are not discussing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| And it's not necessarily that we're saying that all billboards need to be gone everywhere from all of Knox County for the rest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6211)|
| 1:43:41| And that's not necessarily what we are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| However, I do feel like we are setting a precedent by what is decided here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| and that that may well affect where things go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| And I would like to, myself, be at the front end of that, saying I don't think that we should put an end to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| just as much as I don't think that we should put an end to direct mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| And certainly knows, everyone here knows, that we'd all probably like to have a lot less direct mail in our inboxes to have to sort through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| Because, you know, gosh, it's kind of a pain, and it's certainly probably a waste of trees in many occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| I, as an American, may waste a lot of things a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| But, again, they certainly have uses to many, many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| And just as I don't believe that, you know, we should get rid of power lines in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| because I do think there are plenty of people that use power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| I don't think that we should stop being able to expand and do more things with billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| And also because it affects my paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| As someone that I don't currently live in Knoxville, I did for seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| and I've just recently moved outside the Knox area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| But, you know, billboards do have an effect on my paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| I do the artwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| My friend over here, actually, I don't do the artwork, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| My friend over here does the artwork, much of it, that goes up on these billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| And he gets paid for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| And I get paid for finding people that want to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| In fact, the major thing that we do as an advertising agency is business owners come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| They say, gosh, I've got this great thing that I do or sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| and I really want to let a lot of people know about it, and I really don't know what the best way is to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| And many times they talk to us and they want our professional opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| And when we give that, oftentimes it does include use of a billboard because it's an extremely effective advertising medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| And certainly I think limits and restrictions should be put on it within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6341)|
| 1:45:49| However, I would submit to you that I don't believe a complete ban on any further expansion of such is a reasonable measure to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6349)|
| 1:46:00| And I guess I'll open it to questions if anyone has a question of me, or else I'll sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Thank you, Mr. Hartwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| I'm Dennis Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| I live at 1323 Beacon Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| Full disclosure, I'm here as a private citizen, but I am on Mayor Rojero's Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| I'm also president of Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| But personally, I would like to see some very strong regulations on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6393)|
| 1:46:40| That's an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| And I've heard from individuals today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| I've heard from companies today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| I've heard from representatives today of the advertising agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| Tell us how they benefit personally and professionally from what I consider to be a blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| But other people would just call it advertising, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| But four of their speakers have used the word reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| I ask the commission, I ask you folks to be reasonable in how you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| And I think it's reasonable for you to assess what your constituents would ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| And I think what's reasonable is to ask them, do they want more billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| Do they want the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Or do they want less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| So I'm totally in favor of what I've heard today, which is to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| And I would ask you to adhere to that as a legal report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| Thank you, Mr. Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| Okay, any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Any others wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| I'd like to ask Mr. Ammons, would you come back to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6475)|
| 1:48:04| Full disclosure, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| I went to Powell High School, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| Well, that won't carry any weight with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| I'm a Gibbs graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Don't hold that against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| I thought I just, for some reason, I connected with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| You just put a lot of stuff in plain English to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| I'm sitting up here thinking, you know, if we vote on this first thing, let's look back, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6503)|
| 1:48:31| We were talking about the orange route, just to pull up at Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| And that was going to go out to the west, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| As it is now, because it dawned on me with what you said, that you've been doing this for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| like your brother's been doing it for longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| I know your dad's been doing it for even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| As it is now, you can't hardly find a space that's legally where you can put up a new billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| Commissioner Smith, it's so complex because it's regulated by the state on any state right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| And then you have the county, if you're in the county, depending on which county you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| So to say you can or can't, what you find is most of the main arterial roads, interstates, just your main thoroughfares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6548)|
| 1:49:17| it's very hard to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| And then now we're in an economy to where not only is it about finding a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| but it is about being able to make it profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| And because we're not supplemented by anything, then if it's not profitable, we're foolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| And so what you're going to see over time, and you have seen through some of the larger companies as they've looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| they've taken down several locations because it was no longer profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| There was still some demand, but based upon it, it just did not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| That's the way most of our economy is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| And so there have been locations in Knox County that have come down and in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| So to answer your question, I can't give you an exact, but I can say for us that I have advertisers that are in other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6596)|
| 1:50:07| that would like to advertise on a board, hopefully because I give them good service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| that I have in the western part of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| I do not have a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Don't you think that if I could find a marketable location in the county and out-compete my competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| I would have in 15 years put up a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| And you have gotten more stringent since I got in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| You all have changed the radius feet to where it's 750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| You've done some things that have even restricted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| So we were amazed in 2008 when we were trying to survive the 2007 crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6637)|
| 1:50:44| And the advertising industry is really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| But let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| You're doing what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| So you have to take that into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| But I can say with all that's been set up here, the restrictions that were here are in place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| when you pull the moratorium are very good restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| They have proven over time to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| The one thing that's happened is with the technology of the electronic message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6664)|
| 1:51:12| That was something you hadn't dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| Now you can have a large board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And there's even changes now if you all want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I would personally think let it pan itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| If I've seen anything as an industry person, it's not the reading of the message like was stated very well here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| Our state government competes with us and our county does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| But the ones that have gotten me is when the lights are so bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| You all have to think to educate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| The amount of aluminum during the day so that you can read a sign is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| So when you turn to night, those same lights are very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| But the industry has dealt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| And they have signs out there now that will have lower illumination at night, which is effective during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| So there's other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| But, please, don't blanket you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| You started with a concern about electronic message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| And then you reached out into our industry and you grabbed all billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| And then you reached out and grabbed electronic message on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| Well, the discussion I've heard today says that you want to do away with off-premise signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| but you're still willing to allow businesses to have on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| So you're still going to have, I'm sorry, I don't see it as blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| When regulated, it's not blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| It helps us communicate to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| And, effectively, it can benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| Unregulated, yes, I could see maybe blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| But we've had the things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| So now you all, my thoughts are you all vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| But you need to leave those areas that were well enough alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| And if you want to consider something, do some strong research on the message boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| But I'm sorry, from my opinion, four years to hear and to make a decision, I'm sorry for these words, but it's pathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6770)|
| 1:53:00| It's almost, I don't know if it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| If I had the resources, I would research to see if it's illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| I don't even know if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| But that's pathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| You all deal with an issue all the time, and you look at it for six months, and you vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| Don't let the blanket come and grab everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Let that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| If you want to grab and make a moratorium, then you put it on something, do your homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| and then take action based upon the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Because this works in favor of anybody but the small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| Because now you're delaying, and we don't have resources to delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| and we have to make our decisions based on future plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| And I would like to say also, everything that we do, even homeowners associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| take up lands that somebody wanted to look at their backyard and enjoy because we had residents coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| It all has to be regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| There has to be a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| And I personally thought it was balanced prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| It was hard for me to get into an industry that is very restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| But we were able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| And even now we adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| That's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| If you open it back up, are there locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| Yes, there are locations that could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| Are they economically sound?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Probably I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| You all have clogged a drain for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| I don't know what will happen if you unclog a drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| But I can tell you from being in business prior that it was highly regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| And now with the economy, we're running at about 60% of what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| So we have to be very strategic if we add a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| So I don't know if that answers where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| I just want to use it as a reference I learned from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| and I think from Mr. Douglas up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| You know, I'm here today to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| I want to know what's out there, what the regulations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| You know, we have so many issues that we deal with as commission and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6881)|
| 1:54:46| And this is what I've learned, commissioners, and some things that I've thought about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| no, I don't want billboards in subdivisions and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| That doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| We've not built our last roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| If Knox County will continue to grow, fast forward 10, 15, 20 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| let's say the Orange Route or somewhere else, just some other roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| I'm talking major roads are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| From what I've learned today, nothing new can be put up in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| My understanding, you could ask Mr. Pierce, but that's my understanding, that there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Roy, is that the Orange Route was built today from Raccoon Valley down to Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6922)|
| 1:55:31| I think that's where it was coming out, nothing could be put up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| I'm not aware of any state regulation on that, but that's probably accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| It would probably be a scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| As far as the county is concerned is what I'm addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| As far as the state is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Well, if the county put up a road, a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| Only if it was some commercial zoning that went with it, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| Without the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| Right now it couldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| And 640 is a scenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| And there was talk about the state often runs scenic routes during the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| So a lot of times you don't even have to worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| We couldn't put it up because the state owns the roadway and the state has told us we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| There are many locations on a state level we deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| And we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| So you all cannot realize how stringent it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| I mean, I would like to see it go the other way, but I'm in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| That's the reason I'm just appalled that it just keeps going to totally do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| And there are many statistics on both sides, and we can pull statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| I just want to fast forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| You know, I know where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| I know we're moratorium and how many numbers we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| But fast forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| Where were this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| What kind of roads would be built 15, 20 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| And what potential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Commissioner, can I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| If I'm correct, I believe when Turkey Creek was developed, it took down a lot of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| I believe it was Lamar's or other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| There were approximately nine billboards that were taken down for that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| They weren't rebuilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| And there's no location to rebuild them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| So there may be demand, but there's not supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| And even at the time, you had to find a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| So you couldn't just go put nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| See, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| I thought if you put one down in South Knoxville, say, for the storm or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7028)|
| 1:57:13| it could be rebuilt South Knoxville or you could take it to North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| But you're saying, no, that you cannot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| It's location specific, based upon spacing and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| I just wanted to make some general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| It's not really referring to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| But, you know, we've heard people come up from the tourist industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| and other places saying we've got to have this for tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| These states that have banned billboards completely, such as Vermont, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| I think a lot of people would think that Vermont is a tourist state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| If they don't have billboards, how are they attracting tourists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| And it's the same thing with cities like Asheville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| and some of these others that have banned billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| I mean, most people would look at those and say these are tourist destinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| And, you know, when people come here to town, they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| I don't think they're visiting Knoxville because of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| I think they're coming to Knoxville for other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| And they're going to find places to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| They're just not going to eat because there's not a billboard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| And I think another, you know, another issue with the billboards is the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| is this an issue whose time and place has come and gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7105)|
| 1:58:32| With the advertising that we see where people are, you know, they have their smart phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7112)|
| 1:58:39| they have their iPads, they have all these other ways of, you know, of looking at places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| A lot of people plan their trips before they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| And even when you're driving down the road, the guy driving shouldn't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| but somebody can be looking at his iPhone and figure out where he wants to eat and what's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| I know even on my Garmin, in my car, I can push a button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| It'll show how far it is either one way or the other, where the restaurants are and what the restaurants are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7140)|
| 1:59:08| So there's a reason and then there's a trend as to why these things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| And I think the real reason is that the people that we represent, the people that live in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| have said they really don't want any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| And I really believe, I don't know if it's 98%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| but I do believe that if you ask a large number of people that live in this community, I mean, this is our town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7163)|
| 1:59:31| is I think the vast majority of those people feel that they wish we had fewer billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7171)|
| 1:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| We're starting to lose people up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| Ms. Feld, one quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7188)|
| 2:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| I don't know whether we got that on the recording or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| It was about Hawaii and the fact that it's banned billboards and it's a tourist state for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7212)|
| 2:00:20| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| Real quick, you know, Roy, I appreciate you and your staff being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| I do not know this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| I'll be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| If you're hearing stuff, we need your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| If either side is not telling us what the facts are, we need to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| I don't want people stretching things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| We need to deal with what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| So have you found anything that you felt like needed to be corrected this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| I have not heard anything that I would not think was true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Yeah, do not hesitate to use your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Our next meeting is October 29th at 530 here in the main assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| I'd like to thank all of you for your participation, especially those speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| Thank you for your time and thank you for sharing this information with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| I look forward to seeing you on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121008SpecialCalledSignsBillboards?start=7268)|
