| 0:01:11| Absolutely. Please stand and face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=71)|

| 0:01:39| 5B, the marathon at the A.J. Highway, has called in at 2 o'clock to let us know that they have not got an opportunity to be here due to COVID-related illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=99)|
| 0:01:49| So I would look to the district commissioner to see if they would like to defer or what action they'd like to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| Mr. Chairman, I would move that we postpone this until the March beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=122)|

| 0:02:11| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=131)|

| 0:02:14| Now I would like to entertain approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=138)|

| 0:02:25| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| I'd like to turn it over now to Mike Morris from the Knox County Law Director's Office to swear in those who are going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Anybody who's going to testify before the beer board tonight, please stand and raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=153)|

| 0:02:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| By the way, one thing that we need to read into the record for everybody who's going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=168)|
| 0:02:55| Knox County Charter Ordinance 09611105 states that any person lying to or intentionally misleading the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| its committees, subcommittees, or any Knox County Board or Commission authorized by county ordinance or state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| while testifying as a witness under oath shall be guilty of the offense of civil perjury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| and each such offense shall be punishable by a fine of $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you, Director Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| I'd like to turn it over to the clerk's office for the revocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| We have 5A, Michelle Fullmark, 1, 238 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| It's District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Is the owner, Mr. Patel, here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| And do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Scott Jones of the Knoxville Bar, Banks and Jones, 2125 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Here with Mr. Pravin Patel, I have some material that if I could be permitted, I'd like to hand out to the members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| In the meantime, do we have an officer here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Sir, if you would begin by detailing the offenses that you're bringing before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=247)|
| 0:04:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| On January 24, 2022, at approximately 1638 hours, an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| entered the business at 238 Andrew Johnson Highway, and after their ID was checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| they were able to purchase an alcoholic beverage from the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| That's the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| That's the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| That's the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Have we already considered the first two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Jones, does your client admit or deny these allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| He admits with an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Obviously, he was not the one that was there relative to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| We've outlined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| As the board knows, we were in front of the board on two prior occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| and as I've outlined in my submissions to the board on those previous occasions, we purchased software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| we purchased other equipment that would basically prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Unfortunately, no different than somebody literally going in there and taking beer and running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| I mean, he can't do it as the owner because what happened was the individual that was the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| and we've attached his discharge notice, he immediately got discharged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| That day, he was cited for the underage selling of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| He just circumvented the entire system, i.e., he looked at the ID, he did not process it through the electronic reader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| and rather than attempting to ring the beer in the manner in which it should have been rang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| which would have shown up beer, would not have permitted the sale without the electronic reader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| and my client will testify to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| He effectively just over-rang it, which for all intents and purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| it creates a situation where the store owner, albeit he is responsible for what goes into and comes out of his store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=367)|
| 0:06:16| I don't know if it was malicious on the part of this employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| because he was certainly aware that there had been two prior occasions in which this particular business has been checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| But I sit here with Mr. Patel, and he'll be glad to address the board with hat in hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| but literally he's handcuffed to the extent that his employee just ignored anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| and the employee might as well just have thrown the underage individual the beer and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| hit the door, you know, I mean, you know, have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| But I don't know what more a business owner is supposed to do under that set of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Certainly he has to abide by and follow the rules, but that's why we offer the explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| and then we attach the separation notice where this employee was, boom, January 24th, he's hasta la vista, he's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| So that's the circumstances that we'd find him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| If the court wants to hear from Mr. Patel, we can certainly, you know, I'll be more than happy to examine him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=423)|
| 0:07:13| It's a pleasure to the members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Did he ring it up as something different, is what you're saying, than alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| What he did was he didn't scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| If you scan it with a barcode, you know, it's got a UPC code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| If you scan it and you go through the scan, it shows up as beer, you know, clearly is what the UPC would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| But then if you just type it in as miscellaneous and manually put it in like you would an old-time cash register, whatever it was, 1098,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=453)|
| 0:07:41| I don't know how much it was, you do that, you can circumvent the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| I mean, reality of it is until, you know, there's an infallible mousetrap built that a human being can't circumvent the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| then that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| But Mr. Patel is the owner of the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| He's usually there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| This employee was there, and the employee just effectively manually circumvented all of the software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| and everything else that he had put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| If it's okay with the board, I'd like to, since this is, I feel like, going to have a lot of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| I'd like to go ahead and open the floor up now for us to do that instead of a motion first and do that last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| if that's okay with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=498)|

| 0:08:22| Chairman, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Mr. Jones and Mr. Patel, was the same employee responsible for all three violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| You have to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| He was responsible for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| Then we paid for his ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Also, we paid for him to get alcohol education classes done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| So he got the classes done in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| So it's not like he doesn't know the procedures and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| He knows it because he got the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| The second ticket was another employee relative to that, and we were here with the second ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| We felt good that we had put software and everything in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| literally where it has to electronically scan the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| But no different than an employee, you know, if the beer is $20, he takes the $20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| puts the $20 in his pocket and gives him the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Looks like he looks at the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| If he doesn't scan it, you know, absolutely it being robotic in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| there's no way that you can prevent that circumvention of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Mr. Patel, if you could please come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| and give us your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| First, Mitesh Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Address is home or the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| Either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| The house address is 5112 Prairie Clover Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Could you spell your name for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Mitesh, M-I-T-E-S-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Last name, Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Do any other commissioners have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| Commissioner Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Reflecting back to the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| would you tell us again what was actually written in the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Did the intern observe this particular transaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| What do you mean, did they observe the transaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Was he able to see that the system was overridden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| We wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| That's not something we would pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| That's a civil thing on their end, so we wouldn't look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| Is there anything on the receipt that indicates when that's occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| I guess Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=634)|
| 0:10:49| We have the individual receipt that is at the date and the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| and what they did is the individual rang it in as a novelty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| as opposed to beer, which is basically there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| so as they get what they call action merchandise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| things for seasonal and things of that nature that may not be coded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| things that they're selling like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| he overrang it and rang it as a novelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you, Chairman Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| By ringing it up as a miscellaneous item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| is there any way that the business is circumventing the tax on alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| That would be a revenue question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| but I could contact revenue and have an answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| They're not paying the tax on it because it's not rang up as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| but I can answer directly for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Because that would be way for one business to circumvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| If I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| The beer company actually, when he does his wholesale transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| they report the sales, and that basically keeps revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| and that keeps what you're concerned about from happening with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| that because he's going to pay on what his wholesale product is anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Was the ID checked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| It was provided to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| I'd like to come back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Was that the answer to your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Yeah, I was just looking if there's something going on where bringing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| sales, you know, like cigarette sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| they want to know exactly how much you're selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| but that does not go as a recorded beer sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| even though they've already paid the tax as they purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| I kind of understand what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| The beer wasn't necessarily sold more so than stolen almost because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| wasn't ever rung up and charged as a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| That's the part I'm trying to – because he's not – according to his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| register, he didn't sell alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| But he did at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| He sold him the beer, but he didn't sell him the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| That's why I'm – I understand your argument that you're trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Am I accurate on the argument that you're making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Yeah, for all intents and purposes because basically it's rang up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| I mean, it cheats the boss as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| I mean, effectively is what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| I mean, for whatever he does, I mean, it got rang up as a $2.19 novelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| So, I mean, that's what it went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| I mean, here is the novelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| So I don't know if it was, you know, basically a 40 or what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| but that's how it got rang up by this employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I mean, we can't speak as to the employee's mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| If this was one where it was an obvious situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| he knows it's going to be a sting and he knows what it's going to do to his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| employer and ultimately, you know, as basically Harry Truman once said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| I mean, the buck stops with him and he understands his responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| but he also understands that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| he's literally spent thousands of dollars to prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| I mean, he is as chagrined as anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| and that's why I attach both the citation relative to it as well as his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| Tennessee Department of Workforce and Development and Labor discharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| I mean, we discharged him immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| I'm trying to make sense of this in my head, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Since the same employee was the person who had the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| this is probably not relevant to the decision today in a direct sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| but what happened, and maybe this is a question for the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| what happens to that employee, how were they cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| and are they cited in a larger way personally on the second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| So I contacted Assistant DA Sammy Joubron about the issue because his initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| charge was dismissed with cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| This charge, he was given the option for diversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| so he applied for diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| It hasn't come through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| If he's good for six months after that time frame, it gets wiped off his record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| So he was personally cited a second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I attached that citation to the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| If you'll look back through the packet of materials, I attached it to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Let me ask you a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Was that person that cited for the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| he was cited for the first time also, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| And you went through training with him, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| And he also went to alcohol education training at the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| one of the Knoxville Sheriff or the city police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| They offer it every Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| I think it's 8 o'clock they offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| There's a certificate from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| My question is going to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| You trained him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| You told him exactly what not to do, and then you hired him back anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| and this is the second time he's done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| The third offense is very, very strenuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| It could be a harder problem for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| But you still kept that employee on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Did you know that employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| I don't know him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| It's the first time he did it, and so I kind of felt sorry for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| Nothing against him, but since he went to the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| offered to go to training and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| I thought he might probably do the right thing next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| I think we look at the fact that the employee is basically during a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| pandemic, and I mean, I know we use pandemic as the excuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| but when we look at when that initial first offense was, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| you can't get people to hit a lick of the snake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| And so that being said, I mean, he's kind of stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| The problem I have is if he was, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| he just basically gave the beer away to a minor, not even sold it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| but that type of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| But the first time with you training and you talking to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| and he did it the third, you know, made it the third offense for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| I don't know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| If an employee the first time made me spend out money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| he wouldn't be working there the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| And that's just my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Even if it was a pandemic, I'm sorry, but it was to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| And that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Is this something we even have any flexibility over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Yes, you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| You have actually complete flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| The ordinance that we have has a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| discretionary penalty scheme, but it is discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| If you'll notice the language and states that the commission may at its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| discretion, exercise the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| You have any remedy that you'd like from suspension, revocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| offering a civil fine, the whole panoply of things that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| that you have the right to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Way back when, when, when I was here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| we instituted this series of, of graduated penalties because there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| there was a feeling at the time that we wanted some stability in how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| things got addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| but we were careful to make sure that it was discretionary and under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| extraordinary circumstances where you don't believe that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| suggested penalties fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| You can, you can exercise any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| any penalty that you feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| The only, the only limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| being that if you, if you wish to level a civil fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| $2,500 is the max that you can go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| The problem I have is the third offense within a five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| six months period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| And we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| he's for not just the three times that alcohol was probably sold to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1159)|

| 0:19:22| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Alcohol was probably sold to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| I don't believe that our sheriff's deputies are the only ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| probably attempted to purchase beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Sir, I feel, I feel for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| My family ran a convenience store for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| It is hard to get people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| But, but ultimately the buck does stop with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| And it is up to you to vet the people you hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| make sure they're not going to engage in this kind of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| I had one thing to say, and then I'll yield to my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| You know that this, this one, this bothers me, not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| not withstanding the excellent presentation of, of the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| And I know Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Patel has gone to great efforts here after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| but I have to agree with commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| This is three offenses in four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| And, you know, I was listening to the law director and looking down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| the list here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| we've got some first offenders and they're going to get fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| And I can't, I can't support a fine in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I cannot support anything short of a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| The only question is the length of the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And so I will yield to commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| And I agree with your comments and commissioner Smith's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| that this is an egregious situation we have here where a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| who keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| they don't have a right to sell beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| It's a privilege to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| And with that being said, and the amount of offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| I'm prepared to make a motion that we suspend the beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| for the shell food Mart at two 38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1274)|

| 0:21:26| Is it okay to comment before, I mean, there's a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| so I don't know if it's okay to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I guess I would ask the chairman Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220222-beer-board?start=1295)|
