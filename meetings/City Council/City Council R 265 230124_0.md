| 0:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| I know I didn't always take the time to get engaged and involved with my local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| when I was as young as you, so you guys are getting a head start and maybe one day you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| be sitting up here helping lead our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=213)|

| 0:03:46| Councilmembers, I wanted to give you guys a brief summary of some exciting things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| happened to me last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I was up at the U.S. Conference of Mayors in D.C. along with several hundred other mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| and it was a great week of learning from other cities on all kinds of issues and then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| culminated with an invitation to the White House and I don't know about you, but I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| never been to the White House as mayor and it was a pretty special feeling just walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| in there, of course, after a COVID test and a lot of security and that was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| You know, we were in the East Wing and that's the same room where Abraham Lincoln and John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| F. Kennedy laid in state and also apparently Teddy Roosevelt used to have wrestling matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| in there, so I was just in awe just being in that room and then, of course, the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| addressed us and then, to my complete surprise, in the middle of his speech, he was talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| about how he used the American Rescue Plan dollars, unlike previous efforts, and gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| that money directly to cities, even cities our size and smaller, because he knows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| cities know their communities best and know best how to get those dollars to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| in need and so, as you all know, we allocated our American Rescue Plan dollars to all kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| of, you know, helping the homeless and dealing with affordable housing and helping people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| prevent people from getting evicted and infrastructure, but one thing that we also did was support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| our number one thing is our first responders and addressing public safety and President| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| Biden called out, he said in Knoxville, Tennessee, Mayor Kincannon and City Council, he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| parenthetically, allocated their American Rescue Plan dollars for premium pay for police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| and firefighters and then, you know, I looked up and he was like, Mayor, are you here? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| I stood up and he said, there you are, and I said, you know, you couldn't hear me on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| the official stream, but I said thank you and then I sort of, like, was just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| took a minute to recover myself, he went on with his speech, but anyhow, it was a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| special moment for our city, for me personally, but also I think it's a great recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| of the work of this body and investing in our city in very conscientious and intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| ways and, you know, the President of the United States has seen it and acknowledged it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| a special shout out to our fire department and police department, you know, we are grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| for what you do and that's demonstrated in the work that this council does through budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| and other things too, so anyhow, just wanted to share that, it was a memorable moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| Now I also wanted to talk about some upcoming community meetings that I mentioned briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=400)|

| 0:07:14| like a charrette, where representatives will be on hand to discuss several projects including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| obviously our public safety complex, which, you know, is coming to completion, the LMU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=440)|

| 0:07:32| like people can actually see where that is, and also our partnership with Fulton in collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| to encourage and support them in their exploration of public service and first responder careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=458)|

| 0:13:32| like to echo it. Folks, this is really important. It's your opportunity to have some input about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=812)|
| 0:13:41| what's going to happen at the remaining space at the old St. Mary's site and also get updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=821)|

| 0:13:54| to make sure that this community involvement takes place. So, I will repeat, Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=834)|

| 0:15:30| focused on that new CAT bus network. So, this Thursday at 3 p.m. here in the large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=930)|

| 0:15:42| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Okay, thank you, Council Member Smith. Any other reports from Council Members? Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=943)|

| 0:15:55| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 2, Article 3, Division 2, Section 2-449 of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=955)|

| 0:16:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Motion made to approve and second it. Any questions or discussion? Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| Yes, thank you, Mayor. Since we last voted on this issue, I've received some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| from the public, and I've already spoken with the chief about it, and would like, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| the chief could just give a verbal explanation of what the responsibilities of this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| would be for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Sure. So, this deputy chief level position is going to streamline policies, practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| procedures, and training all around a complaint process, internal investigations, body-worn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| camera use, use of force, vehicle pursuits, early warning system. They will be directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| over internal affairs, so we still will have our captain over internal affairs and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| internal affairs, the same internal affairs process that we have, but this will be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| layer of review between myself and internal affairs for these investigations. It's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| to help us ensure that we're meeting or exceeding our standards throughout the department as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| we assess and evaluate policies, practices, procedures, and training around the complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| process, how we use force, and make recommendations on how we can improve either policies, practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| or procedures. And I think it's really going to help us enhance organizational accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| as we move to improve the overall culture of this organization around issues of diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| equity, inclusion, and help us increase legitimacy and trust within the community. And finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| it's in line with two of our four focus areas, which are culture and community, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| our overarching commitment to personal and professional accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you for that. And could you elaborate more on that, how this position will interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| with PARCC? Will this position be the KPD representative at PARCC meetings? Would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| continue to attend those meetings? Currently, complaints that are submitted to PARCC are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1092)|
| 0:18:22| then turned over to IAU for investigation. Would this now be another step in that investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| process that would need to conclude before PARCC could begin their investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| So nothing's going to change with how we interact with PARCC. So I still talk with Tiffany| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Davidson on a regular basis. We meet on a monthly basis. Actually, when you sent me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| that first email, I was sitting in the same room with Tiffany, actually fighting to uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| the termination of a police supervisor involved in some racist marks. So Tiffany and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| a great relationship. So nothing is going to change about how we interact with PARCC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| I would assume that this individual would go to PARCC meetings as well. But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| I'm still less, you know, I have a prior commitment that something else is going on. I expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| to be at all of those PARCC meetings and this person would be with me there. As far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| as with the complaint process, we're evaluating all of our policies and procedures around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| taking in complaints right now. But this is not going to be anything that's going to slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| it down at all. I mean, I believe it's going to be a process to enhance that. But it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| not like this is going to be a separate piece of internal affairs. This is somebody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| going to be, their day-to-day job is going to be managing the operation of internal affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Thank you. That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you. Any other questions or comments? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1181)|

| 0:21:45| Thank you, Mayor. I would like to start by acknowledging that we are all working toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| the same goal, improving life for the pets of our community. We know that the wellbeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| of a pet is in the hands of its owner and we all want to increase the requirements for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| that care, but we clearly disagree on how to get there. The requirements in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| is not a moral imperative, but a tool. What we put in place is not a statement about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| intention. It is a tool that allows us to interact with pet owners, help them understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| how to better care for their pets, and if needed, to remove pets from unsafe environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| Which tool will best allow us to do that? A total ban on unsupervised tethering would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| put us on the path to cite-and-seize, opposed to the inclusive objective of educate-and-assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| which has a much longer-term positive impact on the pet, on the owner, and on future interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| they may have with other pets and people. We cannot allow emotion to supersede logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1358)|

| 0:23:15| treatment when it comes to their pets. Underserved pet owners deserve access to safety net programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1395)|

| 0:23:31| barriers and encourage discriminatory measures to satisfy our own conscience. I implore you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| to seek to fully understand the situation of this large group of residents. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| a call for inclusion and a recognition that all people, no matter their circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1422)|

| 0:24:01| not become lost and stray animals in the shelter. If you can't afford an animal, the thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| went that you shouldn't have one. Just this morning, I received an email from a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| who said, and I quote, animals are too expensive for the poor to even own. This establishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| a false narrative that people experiencing poverty are not only unable to care for pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| but they are somehow undeserving and unworthy of doing so. Some will argue that economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| disadvantaged people may even need pets the most. The hardships of being financially unstable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| can be emotionally overwhelming. Pets make life better and deserve to be with those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| genuinely love and care for them despite budget limitations. We are working to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| this bias now. Amanda Arrington, Senior Director of the Humane Society of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1483)|

| 0:25:53| a long way to go to shifting the culture of animal welfare, but no movement seeking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| transform attitudes and practices toward animals can afford to neglect these concerns. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| to forge a sustainable path to enduring changes, and that means we must think of all our animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1564)|

| 0:26:14| to help the highest number of pets and pet owners and to therefore make a true and lasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1574)|

| 0:26:29| just before we voted on this measure two weeks ago, there was some discussion of some non-substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| amendments, and so I'm going to make a motion to deal with that. I posted in the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| forum the language that needed to be changed. I conferred with Law Director Swanson that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| these were not substantive changes, and the reason that not substantive is important is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| because if they are substantive, then we go back to first reading. But what I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| from Director Swanson is that there are some additional ones that he wanted to add in as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| well. So I think the easiest way to do this is just to have, you've all seen these because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| they're on the forum, but if you, if this makes sense for Director Swanson, maybe to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| go through each one of them, and then we can make motions. I don't know if we can wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| and do motions all at the end or if we have to do them individually. Mr. Swanson. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| you Vice Mayor. I've been trying to think all day of a simple way to do this, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| not a completely simple way to do this, but I think we can do it expeditiously. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| just go through these very quickly, one by one, I have to say that Doug Gordon in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| office has been a very good clearinghouse resource for putting together proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| There are proposed amendments that have come in from multiple sources, and so most of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| the vast majority of them, are just wording changes that make it sound better, that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| it sound prettier, that make it sound more correct. And so I don't think there's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| to need to be a lot of debate, and so what I would suggest to you is, I've got all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| them right here, pages of them, and I would suggest to you that I just identify for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| as we go through who's proposing the amendment, what the amendment is, and then we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| motion and a second and a vote, and if somebody wants to debate any of these, just hold up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| your hand or put on your light or do whatever you need to do. We're not trying to quell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| a debate, but most of these just don't require any debate, I don't think. So I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| get through this at the vice mayor's behest as expeditiously as possible, and he did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| great job putting it out on the forum, so we could have avoided it altogether, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| are a bunch of other ones that didn't get included in that process, so it's just easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| I think, to just do them one by one, if that suits you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Council members, does that sound like a reasonable way forward? Okay, so without objection...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| All right, let's just start then. Start off with number one. Number one is in the preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| of the whereas sections. Council member Parker has suggested that the sentence that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| whereas while citizens requested a review of the minimum standards be changed to whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| citizens requested a review of the minimum standards just leaves out the word while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Does that sound better that way? So, if you all agree with that, is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| Motion made and seconded. Any questions or discussion? Your lights are on, but I assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| it's not about these issues? Okay. Seeing none, all those in favor of this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion to amend passes. Next amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Next one is also in the preliminary whereas language. It just adds the word and so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1797)|

| 0:30:06| and restraint of animals and found the current standards to be insufficient. It just needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| a hand in there to make sense. Motion to approve. Second. Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| Any questions or discussion? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| opposed? Motion carries. I forgot to say that was proposed by council members Parker and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| Ryder. Council member Ryder has proposed the next one which is a definition of adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1826)|

| 0:30:44| what's proper care. Council member Ryder. I think that came from Parker, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| know. I won't quibble over any of it. Council member Parker. I did recommend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| we add a definition of adequate ventilation. Okay. I think the definition came from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1856)|

| 0:31:07| this is adding the definition of adequate ventilation, natural mechanical airflow which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1867)|

| 0:31:34| establishment that keeps animals. I suggested it be changed to any place or establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| that keeps animals. Move to approve. I don't think a daycare person. Motion made. Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1899)|

| 0:32:19| any person who keeps. And I suggest we change that to means premises upon which any person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1939)|

| 0:32:44| is detailed, but we appreciate the detail. As you can tell from the next one, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| having to do with the definition of properly fitted, changing the word have to has. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1971)|

| 0:33:15| in section two, deleting the quotation marks. Motion made to approve and seconded. Any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=1995)|

| 0:33:29| It's the list. Are we supposed to have a copy of this? No, you don't. You don't. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| got it late this afternoon. Can you put it together? Maybe Ms. Hopper can send it. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| I'm just trying to follow with what we're changing, so it would be helpful if I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| Next one is section six. Thank you. At first, I thought we were on this. Yeah, we, we, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2026)|
| 0:33:57| been in definitions kind of up to now. Okay. We're out of the definitions. Okay. Uh, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2037)|
| 0:34:04| we ready for the next one? All right. Uh, next one is in section six. Uh, councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2044)|
| 0:34:13| Parker, uh, rec recommends that we delete subsection a because section 11 F already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| gives the animal control unit authority to impound animals. What was the section being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| omitted? Section six, subsection a. So this is a, a, a bigger change. Yeah. Um, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2066)|
| 0:34:38| this section, uh, my arguments and when I talked to Doug was that the first section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| the first, um, subsection of this language is already included in 11 F. So we have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| language already in the ordinance. And then the, the two sections that follow, um, establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| a cash bond, um, for impoundment. And when I spoke with Doug, I learned that under state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2104)|
| 0:35:14| law, what's that? You can't hear me. The next one where you're deleting it. Six section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| six in its entirety. That'll be the next one. Oh, I'm sorry. Which one are we on? We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| on, uh, delete section a, uh, of section six. Just, this is just the first part of it. Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2127)|
| 0:35:36| so, so the, the, the reasoning behind that is because that language, well, actually the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| reason behind that is because I feel the whole section needs to be deleted. Um, but going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| section by section, the language in that section is included in 11 F. I want to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| with those separately because the deleting sub, subsection a, because section 11 F already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| gives the animal control unit authority to impound animals, that would not be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| Deleting subsection six in its entire, in its entirety, I think would be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| So that's why I wanted to deal with those two separately. We could do the sub, deleting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| subsection six in its entirety first, and if we do that, then we don't need to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| with the other one, I guess. Uh, we may need to because it's, you know, it's just a duplicative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| section, so it's not, you know, something I feel is absolutely needed. Um, but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| I recommended amending the additional items under that, uh, it was recommended that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2194)|
| 0:36:43| entire section was deleted. Okay. Council Member Ryder has a question about this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| or comment. So this conversation, Doug and I had this conversation about 6A, and so he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| had an entire rationale for why it should be there. And so I don't know if Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| wants to tackle that or... No, Mr. Swanson cannot tackle it. Mr. Gordon, Mr. Gordon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| would you please come to the podium? Or I can pull up the email from December where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| we discussed it. Doug's here somewhere. There he is. Mr. Gordon, if you could come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| podium, um, and explain your advice on Section 6. I was hoping, I was hoping to hide in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2239)|
| 0:37:30| back there, but, uh, this is Doug, I'm Douglas Gordon, City Law Department, 116 Westwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Road in Knoxville, Tennessee. Um, 116, excuse me, um, Part A of Section 6, uh, is slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2255)|
| 0:37:51| different than Section 11F. They are very, very similar and could be seen as being duplicative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2271)|
| 0:38:01| Section 6A is more about giving animal control officers to, authority to pick up animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2281)|
| 0:38:09| that are found running at large, um, or just abandoned somewhere. Uh, Section 11F is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2289)|
| 0:38:22| animal control officers having authority to take custody of animals, uh, that are found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| um, at a crime scene. Uh, perhaps this is a crime scene that is unrelated to, uh, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| animal, uh, that just happens to be a pet of the person who has been, um, taken into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| custody and someone now needs to care for the dog, or, uh, it is, uh, an animal cruelty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| case. Um, I think that, I think the two, they're similar but they complement each other and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2329)|
| 0:38:58| they kind of wrap up, uh, the authority that animal control officers need to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| cite if they do pick up an animal. So, uh, I don't think that covering the same grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| twice is, um, a problem. Uh, I like to see clear authority in the code for whenever officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2352)|
| 0:39:24| take an action. So that's, that's why these two things exist. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| Let me ask a specific question. Animal control had to come to my street this morning, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| by the way, please and thank you, um, I get great service from animal control today. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| really appreciate them communicating with me and coming out. Um, three dogs were tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| to a fence and abandoned on the public sidewalk. So what part, are you saying that 6A is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| gave them the authority to take those dogs to Young Williams? Yes, that would be 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| So without 6A, they could not have impounded those animals that were left abandoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| No, I, I think they could have anyway. I think they could have anyway. Uh, but the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| is, um, if anybody is going to, um, argue with the officer's authority, they can point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| directly to that. And that has clear language that points directly to that authority. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| it's sometimes good to spell out different types of authority for officers. So we, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| don't have to do a lot of interpretation. Interpretation is kind of the enemy of actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| applied law. Okay. So both sections give them the tools that they need to get the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2433)|
| 0:40:41| types of the job done. Right, right. Okay. All right. Okay. Council Member Ryder, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| done with the questions on this particular amendment? Yeah, my light was on for other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| things. Okay. Lights have gone on and I don't know why people... Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| we're speaking about the proposed changes to section six. Yeah. Um, I am perfectly fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2456)|
| 0:41:05| with leaving that in. Uh, you know, that striking that was only, uh, suggested by me following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| our conversation. One point of clarification I did want is, um, if those, we'll use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| same scenario, if those two pets were, um, two animals were tied up, you know, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| backyard, uh, of a private residence, does, um, section six give the authority for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2488)|
| 0:41:39| animal to be impounded? Um, if that owner has not given permission? No, it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| Um, now I don't know exactly what happened this morning. Uh, perhaps the, perhaps the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| owner gave permission. They were abandoned. They were on public property. If they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| abandoned and they were on public property... They were tied to a fence, but on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| Okay, then... They were not on anyone's private property. They were on the sidewalk. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| To answer your question, absolutely not. Uh, the, uh, 6A and 11F, uh, neither of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2524)|
| 0:42:13| give officers authority to enter private property without the owner's permission. Um, if an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| officer doesn't have authority under the criminal code without, say, a warrant or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| without exigent circumstances because a crime is going on, that officer does not have authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| and taking a dog would be tantamount to basically stealing a dog. So, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| I think that's a really important clarification, um, for everyone to understand with what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| are able to pass tonight. Um, and so I appreciate that clarification. I am fine with leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| 6A in. Thank you. Okay, so withdrawing, uh, we're moving on to Section 7? Moving on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2569)|
| 0:42:58| Section 7. Well, I did want to discuss the two sections below 6A. The next one is deleting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| Section 6 in its entirety. Um, and I would modify that since we've already discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| 6A to, um, um, modifying, um, Section 6A to retain the original language and add the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2593)|
| 0:43:27| language from 6A. Can you repeat that again? So, maintain the original language from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2607)|
| 0:43:37| section, but add the language from 6A. Which section when you say this section? Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| 6. Keep 6A? Keep the original language of 519, that's the ordinance, the old ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2626)|
| 0:43:59| or the current ordinance that we haven't changed yet. Keep the original language from 519.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| Let me simply discuss what my concerns are. My concerns with, um, those two sections, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2644)|
| 0:44:13| also received, uh, a letter that identifies that section with concern from, um, the Kennel Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2653)|
| 0:44:26| I believe. I can't find my letter now. Um, but there's a due process concern here. Oh, yeah. Um, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2666)|
| 0:44:36| there is, my understanding is a legal uncertainty of whether we can require this cash bond for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2676)|
| 0:44:48| a non-criminal offense. Um, and I couldn't get full clarity from the law department on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| that. I was told we wouldn't know until it's challenged in court. So, ultimately, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| section is a, um, I'm concerned about the undue burden this could have on low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| citizens in our community. Both the requirement to have to post a bond, um, rather than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2709)|
| 0:45:18| the original language required, which was not a bond. Um, and then also this idea that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2718)|
| 0:45:30| you know, we are, um, we are passing something that we are in some ways, um, relying on complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2730)|
| 0:45:41| from residents to tell us what's wrong with it, or legal challenges from residents, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| to tell us what's wrong with it. And in that situation, only those in our community with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| resources would, would be able to, um, make those challenges. And, uh, so those were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| of my concerns with changing from our previous system to now requiring the cash bond. What,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| how would that impact our low-income citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| So, with regard to a legal clarification, I appreciate Doug not going way out on a limb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| with regard to that, uh, but the truth is, uh, we can already require a civil, a cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| bond for a criminal, uh, statute violation, uh, if that occurs. This is simply a cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| bond, uh, for a civil ordinance violation. I know of no law that would prohibit us from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| doing that, and it certainly provides an extra tool to those who are trying to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| our laws, uh, and so until some court of competent jurisdiction says that that is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| that we can do, I really believe that it is. So, whether you should do it or not, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| the question that Councilman Parker raises. I'm just saying, uh, that I don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| legally impermissible, uh, and it is an additional tool for the enforcement officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| Yeah, Ms. Fugate, Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| I have a clarifying question about that. Do we impose fees on, fines on other civil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| Well, this is not a fine, this is a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Well, a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Do we do that for other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| To pay for the expenses of going through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| Right. Do, you said we do it for criminal. You think we can, you think there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| to prohibit us from doing it for civil? Do we, is there any other ordinance that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| that? I'm just, for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Provides for a cash bond? Not that I can think of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| It's, it's kind of a, sort of a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Um, your lights are on to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| We require cash bonds in certain, uh, engineering projects and things of that nature, in developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| and things like that. I mean, we do require cash bonds for things like that, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| really different than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Is, I'm not sure if we did a motion and a second on this proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| I don't think we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Okay. Is there a motion on this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| I'd like to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Do I need to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Do I need to give the language of the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Well, probably, but, but why not, you know, I think, uh, you know, we could see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| a second first or, you know, yeah, I think there's some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| I'm not sure what the motion is for. So are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| But I don't know if you could help me, Charles, with the original, with the language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| I offered with that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| We'll figure out what the language is that fits what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| If that's what council decides to do, we'll put together the necessary language and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| bring it back to council to make sure that they didn't disagree with it if they adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| If we can do that, essentially it's to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| It's not the way we usually do things, but this is, this is such a unique kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| that I think we can make it happen if council wants to go in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| But essentially my motion is that we, um, maintain our, um, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| You just said the word I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| Um, our, our, our penalty system, our fines bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| No, that we maintain our fine system of fines for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| And we do not implement a new bond system for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| It's, it's also just as in any ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I mean, you know, there can be refinement later if we don't have the language that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Uh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| I'll second it because I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Council Member Testerman, I think you had your light on first to ask a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Is that a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| It's not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| I would just like to offer some clarification from, um, the shelter experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| So the care bond language was already in there and kind of just so you all understand how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| it works is, first of all, from our judicial system, you know, care bonds are, care bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| are sometime, um, are extended, but not often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| So how this works is when animals come into the shelter, it's a, um, it's a court case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3030)|
| 0:50:38| which could be, um, an animal has come in for a cruelty and neglect case, or it's come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| in through an unrelated animal charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| So if an owner's been incarcerated, if an, um, an, uh, animal has been abandoned, et| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| cetera, um, then we are required to hold these animals in our custody until that entire judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| process is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| And, um, so let's say that a cash bond is not issued, then we, when that court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| comes up, then we, um, present restitution for however long that animal has been in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| And, you know, it could be, it could be for a week, but we've had animals in our custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3078)|
| 0:51:24| for over a year, for two years, and somebody has to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| And, um, you know, there's been, you know, six figures in restitution that the animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| center has not collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| So I'm just saying it, it, it goes to protect, um, the overhead and the care of these animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| while they're in our custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| And so a lot of jurisdictions do cash bond, it's usually for 30 days, which is a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3109)|
| 0:51:57| times very minimal for how long these animals are in our custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| So if somehow that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Uh, Council Member, uh, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Um, Council Member Testerman, I just wanted to go over what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| So if we were to approve the amendment as we've heard, would we basically be shifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| financial responsibility from the responsible individual to the shelter, which in turn would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| mean, you know, the, the taxpayers, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Well, so really this language, we just cleaned up the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| I mean, the language was already in there, so really simplified what this language said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| and I think Mr. Gordon can, can attest to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| Um, so yes, if we do not get a care bond, or if we do not, are not awarded restitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| then the shelter has to go after those funds, either in a civil case, or we have to write it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3177)|
| 0:53:05| So yes, at that point, then, um, the shelter has to absorb that overhead and those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| for the time that the animals are in our custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| And Mr. Gordon, if I could, um, with this section that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| the difference between what is currently in place and the cash bond that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3206)|
| 0:53:36| I think that would help clarify that for Council as we're considering this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| Which, which ordinance is this, where the cash bond is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| I think it's in Section 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| 6B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| What does Section 6 modify, again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Chapter 5, Article 4, Section 519 is hereby amended by deleting the section in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| and replaced with the following, 6A and 6B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Section 519 of the City Code, um, let's see, refers to pay applicable fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3247)|
| 0:54:19| medical fees prior to the release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| It doesn't strictly mention the state criminal statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| um, but it gives the general responsibility of having to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3268)|
| 0:54:36| Uh, so, but what the new amendment does is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| this can be interpreted to be just the criminal statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3282)|
| 0:54:49| to apply just the criminal statute to requiring a cash bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| So, um, I think, uh, Ms. Parker's interpretation is more accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| in that what's going on here is it, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| applies the cash bond requirement to animals seized under the civil ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3307)|
| 0:55:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Okay, uh, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| Um, I'm curious if, um, there's any sense from young Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| and I apologize for putting you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| but, um, I heard you talk about care that hasn't been paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| um, but do you have a sense of, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| how many impoundments, um, you all are already handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| that are not based on criminal conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| that are not based on a, something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| involves a court case that needs to be resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Do you have a sense of how many non-criminal impoundments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| young Williams is handling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| There aren't going to be as many as, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| the criminal side, I can't tell you, in our custody right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| but, you know, also just as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| back during COVID, when the courts were closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| that became a significant onus on us to care for these animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| because the courts weren't open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| And so, um, unless an owner surrenders an animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| then, again, they're responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Somebody has to pay for the care and upkeep, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| and quality of life of this animal while they're with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| So, um, you know, I can't, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| some of them also may be charged criminally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| but then the court doesn't find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| So, um, or, um, so with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| and I don't know if, um, I just don't have, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| records right now, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| I mean, most of them are going to come in for cruelty charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| but at the same time, the court might not always find that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| um, they might be diverted or that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| But I guess what I'm trying to say is there are cruelty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| or there are criminal offenses that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| that aren't always, you know, they might be diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| And therefore, the owner at that point has no responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| which really isn't, that's why a care bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| ideally is issued up front for that animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| who's in our custody for that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| regardless of the outcome of the court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| But generally, if they're coming in on criminal charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Well, and just to clarify, I'm simply recommending, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| that we maintain a fine system for civil impoundments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| but that we continue the, uh, cash bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| for the criminal impoundments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Well, and there's a separate fee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| So by ordinance, it said when an animal comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| there's a $30 impound plus $10 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| So that accrues on top of any criminal care bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| I mean, that goes toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| So, um, but again, we're a lot of time keeping animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| in our care without any guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| that these fees are going to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Um, and so it's a way for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| especially if it's going to be long-term cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| which generally these court cases are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| for us, uh, again, to be able to cover and recoup the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| that is invested in these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| But I can't tell you the breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| of civil versus criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Uh, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Okay, so Councilwoman Parker's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| is that the cash bond component is in 11H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| which is the criminal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| and that it's also in 6B, which is the civil side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| So I guess, Councilwoman Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| this edit came from you guys' discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Are you saying that it needs to stay in both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| You are saying that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Um, tell me how that would play to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| to help us all understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| And I'm, I apologize, I am really tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| because the dogs that got taken this morning kept us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| Um, so, the dogs that got taken this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| and they're now, unless the owner was found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| how does this cash bond apply to an issue like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| Like, the animals are taken in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| So that case isn't, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| So the owner was found, my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Which is good, because she was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| It was a homeless couple, and the husband is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| who supposedly, um, tied them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| and to do something temporarily, is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| and the wife was in an emergency clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| But how does the cash bond apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| The cash bond, they don't go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| At that point, they come, they reclaim their animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| at which point, they just pay reclaim fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Now, granted, it was a homeless couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| I don't know what happened, I was not, um, there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| But we have the ability to waive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| for financial hardship, any of those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| The bond is issued by the court, not by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| So that doesn't play into a simple situation like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3660)|
| 1:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| That's what I was trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| I appreciate that clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| I just think that's a really important point that was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| that, you know, Young-Williams would be able to waive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| those fines on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| And we do, but the care bond is, and what's stated in these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| are issued by the court, and it gives the court the ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| especially for these long-term cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| to help us cover those costs of the animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| that generally are with us for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| And I don't have any evidence on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| but it just seems like the long-term cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| would be those criminal cases that have a court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| And so, with the civil cases, we can be less punitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| and just apply fines that could, in some situations, be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| And then Young-Williams can come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| and argue for more money from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| because, you know...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| But still, you know, the penalty for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| I feel like it needs to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| It's really at the court's discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| and the judge's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| And generally, they'll take all circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| into consideration when determining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| So, like I said, I'm not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| I wish care bonds were issued more often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| but they're not, and they're oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| where the shelter at our expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| might go after some cases civilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| Okay, seeing no further questions or discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=3753)|

| 1:07:43| So hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| So up above, below lighting and lightning, we have delete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| subsection C, which is the, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| I'm going to go down to section 11 because that's what we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Subsection C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| But we're within 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Delete the responsible and competent person must be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| owner or a person designated by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| That's what we approved last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| We're saying to delete that and modify it with the responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| and competent person is outside with the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| So we're getting rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| We deleted the responsible and competent person must be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| owner of a person designated by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| That's just an additional element of proof that really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| not needed for enforcement purposes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| That's the one we already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| The one you're working on right now just changes the wording to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| say that the person doesn't include the language within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| visual range of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| So the person could be outside and turn their back and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| working on their flowers and the dog's outside with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| So we just blew by something that I didn't even know was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| the edits, which is to get rid of that basically defines what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| responsible and competent person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| So to my knowledge, there's been no discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| changing that from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| What section is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Section 11, subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| What we voted on last week is it shall be unlawful to tether an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| animal unless the person, unless the animal is tethered under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| direct supervision of a responsible and competent person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| The responsible and competent person must be the owner or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| person designated by the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| So I recall no discussion about striking that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And so apparently we just voted to strike that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Like there's been discussions that have gone around with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| representatives of Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| removing the visual range part because if you're outside with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| your animal, they could be in the backyard, side yard, front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| yard, they don't have to be within your site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| But now we're redefining who's supervising, like who the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| responsible and competent person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| So maybe Councilwoman Parker or someone who proposed that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I didn't know how it got on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Part of the discussion with the law department was how would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| animal control verify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Does every animal have to be left with the permission slip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| To me it was, and even owner, ownership can be a little tricky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| to prove at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| And so it felt like, as Director Swenson said, another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| unnecessary step to be able to enforce this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| We want the animal supervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| As with many things, we rely on the judgment of that owner to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| ensure that the animal is supervised well, whether that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| by the owner or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| But I just, in that moment when animal control shows up, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| does that competent and responsible person prove that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| they're designated by the owner to watch the animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| More importantly, when you get to court, how do you prove that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| they're designated by the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| I wasn't privy to the conversation and wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| expecting the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| So I appreciate knowing that you'd had a conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| So the amendment...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| I just went along with it because Doug said it was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| The amendment before council right now is whether or not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| delete the phrase, within visual range of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| The responsible and competent person is outside of the animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| or the responsible and competent person is outside of the animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| and within visual range of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| The visual range is what the language reads now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| The amendment is to delete that clause that talks about within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| visual range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Does everyone understand the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Council Member Testerman, you have a comment or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| So to clarify for everyone, given that members two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| ago of chain-free asked the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| So to make everyone aware, so what is being proposed is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| zero-tolerance ban on unsupervised tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| meaning a dog cannot be outside properly tethered in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| circumstance without the owner being outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| So we brought up, you know, if an elderly Mrs. Jones is unable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| to walk her dog, and the only way for that dog to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| enrichment, to get exercise, and to be outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| is for that animal to be outside, properly tethered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| and she's not allowed to go inside to do chores, to cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| to do anything that she might do in her day-to-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4416)|
| 1:13:43| And, you know, I would say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| if we're a pet-friendly city, so if you take your dog to Three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| Rivers Market, and they have places where you can tie up your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| dog, you can't go inside and shop and leave your dog outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| You can't go to French Market Cafe and leave your dog on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| patio and go inside and order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| You would be in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| So just so everybody is clear, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| there are no exclusions, there are no exceptions to these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| you know, everyday events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| And, you know, ordinances offer no latitude or room for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| selective enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| So, you know, I just feel like, again, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| we're making law for the exception and not the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| And, you know, so then if an owner doesn't bring a dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| inside, you know, then they're faced with potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| giving up a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| And, you know, so I just want to be clear because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| certainly asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| People were not clear, so you mean an animal just can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| outside for a few hours enjoying the sunshine and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| exercise and enrichment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| And, you know, for me that's a monumental problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| So I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| For me, this language is a big compromise section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| I don't feel like it's perfect and future changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| might be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| But I was not able to come up with any language to propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| that would address all of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Initially I thought it's a big enough change in Knoxville if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| simply require a responsible and competent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| person to be on the premises with the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Because there are individuals and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| I've spoken to folks about my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| I was one of those individuals who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| left their pet for the day while I went to classes at UT and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| had an escape artist and I lived on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| And once my pet got loose and was hit by a car on Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| Highway, I put other measures in which included a tether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| And so I'm sympathetic to pet owners who are trying to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| responsible pet owners and do all that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| But they're not home all day, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| like working people and students and others are not home all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| So just requiring someone to be on the premises while tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| to me was a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| But I couldn't come up with a language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| And I thought about, you know, if animal control shows up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| someone is on the premises but they're inside the house and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| they can't hear animal control, I just thought of all the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| that could come up and how hard this would be to prove in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| that someone was not on the premises if you did not search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| their entire property, including inside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| So this was kind of the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| And I was thinking even, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| if someone is monitoring their animal outside and they're more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| aware of what's happening, they'll see animal control come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| And they can even say, you know, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| I just stepped inside for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| And hopefully animal control will use some of their discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| But the truth of the matter is, is this could be abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| And I do think that it's something that we should monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| We should monitor how this impacts our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| I also wanted to suggest an amendment that would put in a process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| monitor that impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| But I didn't come up with a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| And Doug didn't come up with a good idea either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| So that needs more thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| But I'm in support of this compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| But I do have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| I do think it's a big shift for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Then Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| So this is, of course, the one that's of big contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| And it's the point that we don't agree on, some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| And I find no pleasure in being in disagreement with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I always like to find a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| The reality is, for example, like this morning when I had to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Animal Control, they start their shift and they already have a backlog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| of seven calls before the sun came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| That was before any phone calls came in for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| My husband sees 14 patients a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| So you start with seven in the queue and you're going to build more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| through the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Animal Control has the competency, our employees have the competency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| to make interpretation discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| And they did so with those phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| They already had seven phone calls before they talked to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| And they came to those dogs because they were in the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| So they had to decide in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| I'm just guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| We didn't debate it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| But they had to decide where they were going first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| They don't have time to go running around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| And that was explicitly part of the conversation for the year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| that this was discussed at Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| is that they don't have the time to sit and watch for 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| so they couldn't put time constraints in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| And this is not meant for I stopped by a restaurant and got something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| and Animal Control knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| And we all know that by the time they got there, the animal would be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| So anyway, I could say more about tying your animal up at a public restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| I don't know many restaurant owners that would want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| I would actually disagree with Councilwoman Ryder on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| I think 15 minutes is sufficient enough time to enforce something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| I think it's quick enough for somebody to do something inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| And I think it's reasonable to expect an officer who is offering discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4823)|
| 1:20:32| 15 minutes is enough time to evaluate the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| And so the language that I think is an even better compromise is to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| or inside for no longer than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| If an officer is going to be on scene with a situation that somebody has called about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| they're going to be there for 15 minutes anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| So whether the dog's chained up to the fence in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| or inside getting a cup of coffee or doing something before work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| 15 minutes, I think, generally based on the change we just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| is acceptable for everyone to think it's humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| There's no reason, I think, for Councilwoman Testimer's example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| an elderly person can't sit inside while it's pouring rain for 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| and let the dog be outside for 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| So the message we would be sending to residents is you either need to be outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| with your animal or inside for no more than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| And that's easy to enforce without overburdening the animal control officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| I think we all understand staffing constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| but that's not a reason for us to kind of open up ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| to this middle group of people who are responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| but want to let their animal have some brief time outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| and also aren't going to allow to be able to have a 10-by-10 fence on their yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| just for that 10 to 15 minutes a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| And I think that language is specific enough and is enforceable enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| for everybody to be able to do this safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| So that's the language I would suggest is or inside for no more than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4930)|
| 1:22:19| You're proposing an amendment to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| I won't go so far as to make a counteramendment just yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| but I'll just let that out there for my colleagues to count on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| or comment on since this is all part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| I think where I struggle with is what I struggle with a lot every time we make an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4955)|
| 1:22:43| that people will say, well, that won't get enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| Somebody will have discretion and they won't turn somebody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| So I like some sort of compromise that doesn't automatically make people be breaking the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4972)|
| 1:23:02| because I do worry that it's a precedent if we just say the law is broken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| but we're not going to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| We hear that complaint about noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| We hear that complaint about scooters when they were doing whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| So that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| So since I'm a compromise kind of person, I do like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| There can be all kinds of arguing about how much time is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| but I appreciate the attempt you're trying to make that not everyone can be outside with their animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5013)|
| 1:23:43| or physical limitations or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| I think the compromise language that we were looking for since we discussed this in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| we discussed this at length last time, we're discussing it at length today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| The compromise is removing the language and within visual range of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| That gives you flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| We talked about it before in multiple different venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| It's not enforceable when you have time limits because you're asking the officer to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| and whatever you give them, 15 minutes, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| they're going to have to sit there and wait for 15 minutes before they do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| What Councilmember Ryder just told us is they're starting the day behind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| so they're not going to make it to the next call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| I think we should leave this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| I think we should make the compromise, remove the language about visual range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| and leave it alone, and if we have a problem, we can come back and look at it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| Councilmember Ryder and then Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Well, I just would like to ask one of the animal control officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| I believe maybe Officer Bender is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| I don't know if Officer Hogue is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| I know time limits were discussed at the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| and rather than us determine what the staff can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| maybe we can ask them why they didn't want a time limit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| I understand where you're coming from, Councilman Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| but it's part of the Animal Control Board discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| They specifically asked for a time limit not to be in there, so I respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| Officer Hogue, do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| I don't mean, I'm sorry to put people on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| but you guys did discuss a time limit at Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| and you guys were not in favor of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| so I just want you to verify that before we put a time restraint on your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| Officer Hogue, National Animal Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| You pull the mic up so we can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Officer Hogue with Knoxville Animal Control with 3918 Windsor Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| As far as with the time limit, as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| I have one officer working on day shift and one officer working the evening shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| and like this morning, for example, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| she had seven calls by 10 after 7 to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| and for her to go to the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| it's going to take at least 20 minutes or so to get through traffic to get to any call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| and then while they're at the call, depending on what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| you're talking another 15, 20 minutes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| So, you know, for each call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| you can basically figure it's going to take about an hour, 45 minutes or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| to answer each call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| So right there she's almost got like a whole day worth of calls to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| and like when I left to come here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| the officers, they already had like 34 calls on their log sheets and stuff from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| and that was just for two officers to answer those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| So, I mean, as far as having an officer sit there for 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| then that's going to put up another call that they have to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| for at least 15 minutes or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| They're going to be either going to have to not answer calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| when they get done with their shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| or they're going to have to work overtime in order to get all their calls answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5235)|
| 1:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| And then before I hand off the mic, I just want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| the other cities that have passed no unsupervised tethering period just said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| No unsupervised tethering, Asheville, Johnson City, and they've made it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| and they're not punishing people who are like my grandmother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| who let their dog out for a few minutes when they came home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| Animal control is not going to make it over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| And from my experience, and I certainly can't speak to this as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| as the animal control officers or Councilwoman Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| they know a lot of the dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| It's the same calls, I think, some of them over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| My concern is it doesn't sound like we have enough animal control officers as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5293)|
| 1:28:22| I mean, is that, I mean, I'm not, please don't clap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| I'm asking a question to my colleagues about how many on average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| maybe Councilwoman Testerman, you can answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| on average how many calls or did the animal control board talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| how many calls come in a day on average for complaints about pet animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5320)|
| 1:28:49| So, and Chief Nowell can, so there are positions for more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5329)|
| 1:28:58| but they've had a myriad of different issues, and Officer Ho can probably speak too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| They've had some out on medical leave, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| So I think they're budgeted for eight or nine, and so with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5345)|
| 1:29:13| but they've been understaffed just like everyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| and then a myriad of reasons why people aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| So in the city alone, animal control is, this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5358)|
| 1:29:25| was just under 10,000 calls that come in, so divide that by 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| So roughly, I mean, in the shelter, we're getting in 30 to 40 animals per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| I think Councilmember Smith is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| Okay, Councilmember Smith, and then we'll come back to Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| I will say this ordinance alone will increase calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| So if we're concerned about whether the animal control officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| can handle the bandwidth of increased calls at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| this is going to do more than anything we're already going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| So I don't think that that's a good argument for not doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| I also think most cities that we were presented that recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| not having a time-based ordinance were hours, not 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| and 15 minutes is a minimal enough time to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| Actually, it's the least amount of time we can add for responsible owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| and I don't want to put the responsible dog owners, who we all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| that someone who's allowing their dog to sit outside for 15 minutes tethered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| this ordinance itself inherently, the one related to being outside with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| inherently says that's humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| There's no difference between being inside and outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| and there's no problem with enforcing 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| And I think if we need more staffing, we need more staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| That shouldn't be the reason we put responsible dog owners in the crosshairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| of a lot of these really good changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| So I really think the 15 minutes is a great compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| and I think to just close our eyes and pretend that those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| are not going to call in or be inaccurately accused of being inhumane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| is setting ourselves up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| So I won't be supporting this amendment because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| but I'll offer a counter-amendment for 15 minutes inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5477)|
| 1:31:25| Are you making an official proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Okay, there's a motion to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| Under Robert's Rules of Order, you can't amend an amendment, but if y'all want –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| A substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| If y'all come up with some consensus you want to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| certainly we can get around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| I'll offer a substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| A substitute amendment that would say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Let's vote on the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| Tell us what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Right now the motion to amend before you would remove the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| and within visual range of the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| It just says the responsible and competent person is outside with the animal, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| We have a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Is your light on to talk about that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| No, my light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| And all those –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| I can say something and then we'll go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| Should I get the first comment on the amendment that's coming next because it ties to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| Sure, I got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| I'll say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| And then we'll go to Ms. Testa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| I will just say to Councilman Smith, I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| I just thought it was really important to hear from the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| I will disagree with you on it potentially increasing the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| That is not what the other cities have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| There's plenty of research to back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| Secondly, what I said two weeks ago when we voted on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| is this is not an ordinance intended to be enforced by calling animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| We have several, not just one, very strong nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| that are knocking door to door on every one of the doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| and have not been – they've had amazing results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| and they haven't been refused except for like two or three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| that wanted to keep their animals intact to breed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| So there's the people – the idea and what I said to the mayor was to work hand in glove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5589)|
| 1:33:16| with the organization that's there, that's being well-funded, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| We'll vote on this and then we'll hear your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| I had a question, but I guess to that I do know for a fact that call volumes do go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5607)|
| 1:33:37| If we've got that kind of community support, which I said in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| and people that are going door to door and working with pet owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| then I would question why we need an ordinance at all banning unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| But on this ordinance, we all know where I stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| but I think removing visual range is better than as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| but 15 minutes is better than visual range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| So I'm trying to support – I would support that over what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| but support 15 minutes over what's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| You're allowed to vote yes for both things and see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| I'm just clarifying that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Yeah, I'll just clarify that my amendment is supplemental to the one being voted on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| so we can go ahead and vote on this one and then offer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Any further questions or comments on the amendment before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| which would delete the clause and within visual range of the animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| Mr. Smith, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Do you want to talk on that particular amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| It's a habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| All those in favor of this amendment, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| Mr. Smith, did you want to offer an amendment now that that clause has been deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| The responsible and competent person is outside with the animal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| and I would suggest adding or inside for no more than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| And I would offer –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Let's see if there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| And I would offer that although the body of work ahead of the nonprofits in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| that are going to help fill in the space from the long-term tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| they won't provide fencing at the moment for these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| who are just doing it for 10 or 15 minutes while they get ready for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| They are not allowed to apply for fencing support, for lack of a better phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| So these people will be maybe mistakenly accused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| They're actually behaving humanely with their animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| So I think it's a good amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| and I think it's good to supplement what we've just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Could I ask Mr. Swanson a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Mother, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| So in past discussion, I am not disagreeing with your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| I want to ask about additional potential language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5769)|
| 1:36:16| Y'all, on task, on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| State of Pennsylvania across the board pretty much uses the phrase temporary task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| Temporary what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| To complete a temporary task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| So their unsupervised tethering ordinance will say long enough to complete a temporary task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| Do you see any justification or practicality to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| Councilman Smith, what did you say, to add 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| I actually didn't use to complete a task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| because I wanted it to be very specific for enforcement purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| because I realized that to complete an ordinary task is pretty loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| Well, I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| I'm wondering if there's a benefit to combining temporary task with the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| So that's my question to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Just from a lawyer's point of view, leaving it at 15 minutes is better and simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| because you don't have that additional element associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Councilmember Smith, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Everyone understand what the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Oh, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| Well, I just wanted to offer that from the community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| who've been working really hard on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| they shared several documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| some compiled responses from other cities and their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| And one thing that stood out to me in terms of the enforcement piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| was some difficulty that some cities had with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| And one that stood out for me was Forsyth County, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| And there were concerns or their experience had been that it was difficult to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5882)|
| 1:38:14| that the owner was not present and supervising the animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| if they did not have evidence from like a body cam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| that would show the full area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| If the owner came and said, oh, I was just behind the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| I don't know what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I was, you know, on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| And so my concern was that animal control here does not wear body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5919)|
| 1:38:49| And the more details we put in, how will they be able to prove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| So I have the same question with the 15-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| Does there need to be video evidence showing that it was a 15-minute time span?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| Is word of mouth, you know, relying on the word enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| I'm just curious how we would prove that if the owner pushes back on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5952)|
| 1:39:21| that the officer actually did stay there for 15 minutes to monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Testimony under oath is still allowed, and that's still actual honest-to-goodness proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| You don't have to have a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| You can have an officer who was there and observed the situation come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| and testify that the person was gone for more than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| I was there for 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| The person was inside for more than 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| I don't know why this was an issue in Forsyth County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| but they're expecting more evidence now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| The law director said basically what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| which is the proof is going to be that an officer is going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| They're going to wait 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| And we just listened to the folks who we asked to get up early in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| and work late at night and answer more calls than they can deal with in a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| how this will affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| And they said, you know, this will slow us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| There's less calls that we can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| The compromise, we've already figured out what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| We've already passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| So I don't support the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| I think we should vote this one down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| And I know where it's coming from, and I think it's coming from a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| It's coming from a place of how can we deal with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| how can we protect, you know, this small instance that might happen, you know, very rarely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6045)|
| 1:40:53| You just can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| I've looked at it every way I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| You've got to be on one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Either we're going to do this or we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| And I'm saying let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| I also am going to stay the course and not support the 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| Just as you would have to prove and be very difficult to enforce the 15-minute part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| you also can't prove that they weren't outside with the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Same side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Johnson City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| It would be very difficult to enforce a 30-minute tethering limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| They also said they had no increased call volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Asheville, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Yes, time tether would be impossible to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| They also cite no increased call volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| I'm just going to take these cities at their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| They didn't just pass this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| They've been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| This is a culture change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Impossible to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| We allow tethering as long as an adult is outside with the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| New Hanover County, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| This is difficult to enforce and also difficult to prosecute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| It creates a defense of did the officer witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Forsyth County, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Allocating time for tethering is very difficult to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| especially for large agencies with high volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| There's a long paragraph here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| Palm Beach County, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Our ordinance requires that an officer witness a violation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| received two affidavits from neighbors living in separate dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| in order to establish that a violation occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| That's in Collier County, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| So they say time chaining would require either intensive time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| investment or cooperative citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| Timed ordinances are extremely difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| A violation would have to be witnessed as it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Miami-Dade County, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Enforceability is the key to any legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| Two often well-meaning legislators pass ordinances and they talk about times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| Courts are not favorable to allowing laypersons to have observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| and then come to court as a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Time won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| That's Hillsborough County, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| These are all places that have done it without a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| And I'm going to rely on them and also go back to just as you'd have to prove the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| you'd also have to prove they weren't outside with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| And also repeatedly, repeatedly, other things that have been said tonight are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| you know, somewhere it got thrown around something about taking animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Animal control and the law department have repeatedly said animals will not be confiscated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| So I really think that needs to be reinforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| This is all complicated and everybody is coming from a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| I am not going to support the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| I do understand the reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| I'm heavily kind of influenced, I think, by the animal control officers and the other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6212)|
| 1:43:41| This is probably not going to be the final word, but I think we should pass it as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| and then we can monitor this and just see in practicality how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| I'm afraid that trying to put a time limit on it is just going to be so difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| In a sense, it's going to weaken our efforts here to provide better care for animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| So I think I'm not going to be able to support the Second Amendment at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| Down the road we can review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| It's implemented, but right now I'm going to stay with it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| So basically what we've just approved is that if the person is not outside with the animal, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6263)|
| 1:44:30| they are getting a fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| If the person is not outside with the animal, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| No, they're getting a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| They're violating the ordinance, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| So animal control just happens to ride by and my dog is outside by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| because I had to run in the house and get my phone or go to the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| Then they'll give me a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| And eventually that warning could turn into if a neighbor wants to say that, oh, she's, you know, causing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| I think a lot of this stuff is going to be driven by neighbor disputes, to be perfectly honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| I don't see that anyone's going to be saying that when they know that their neighbor does not mistreat their animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| and they happen to have them outside for a few minutes and you accidentally left something on the stove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| you need to run in, you know, and do something really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| I am concerned again with, you know, this being neighbor dispute driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| what that could turn into, to be perfectly honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| So I'm a little torn right now on this one by it just being so definitive that if you're not physically outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6340)|
| 1:45:48| then you're breaking the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| And there's no allowance whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| Not even now we've taken that within visual range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| So I'm really struggling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Councilmember, let's see, who is next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| Smith, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| I would just add two things to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| We can't utilize the, we can't use the limited capacity of our animal officers when it suits us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6375)|
| 1:46:25| This ordinance will increase calls and largely for good reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| because we've made some changes to where multiple hours is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| They are going to get more calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| So let's not use that as an argument against something else that comes off to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| The second thing is all of the cities that have urged against this have highlighted 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6401)|
| 1:46:50| multiple hours as a reason to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| And we've just taken away visual range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| And so I do think that there's room for suggesting that this will take more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| but let's not use that as an excuse to not do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| because we've just added more workload for this whole entire ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| So I'll call the question if there's no more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| Voting on calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| A question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Call for the question, I think past 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| We had somebody ask what we're voting on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| Call for the question was to end debate on the amendment about the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| So we're voting to end the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Yes, I'll vote yes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Who could vote against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| We succeeded in calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| So now we're voting on the amendment about 15 minutes to add 15 minutes or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| And if you vote yes, it's to approve the amendment that Mr. Smith proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| I understand debate is ended, but you probably need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| because this is different than all the rest of them so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| this will be a substantive amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| So that bumps us back to first reading if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Or reading on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| But visual range did not change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| Within visual range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6497)|

| 1:49:34| It's one that was out on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6574)|

| 1:49:41| But we have to go back to Section 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| And it's moving the subsections G and H to subsections C, E, and C, F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| G is revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6591)|

| 1:49:56| And H would be failure to comply, cooperate with animal control or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| harassment or any control officer shall result in immediate permit revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6599)|

| 1:52:11| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| I just wanted to quickly state for the item two items ago that we voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6732)|
| 1:52:21| on and we approved, we didn't read all of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| And so I just wanted to make sure it was stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| We're just moving sections around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| But there's a few words that we were cutting out of there, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| result in the immediate revocation of a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| But that language was cut in addition to language being moved around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| So I just wanted to make sure that that's the change we just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| I think so because that's what's written on your paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| Yeah, it was the change that was published in the council forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| No, well, actually, what was in the council forum was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6782)|

| 1:53:07| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| I don't know if that was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Any other questions or comments on the language before us about adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| the language adequate space for exercise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230124?start=6797)|
