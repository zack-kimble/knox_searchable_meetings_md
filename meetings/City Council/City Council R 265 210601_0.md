| 0:03:03| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Again, it's still a privilege to see everybody face-to-face, and I really appreciate being together and seeing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=184)|
| 0:03:12| I hope you had a restful Memorial Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| At the invitation of Hugh Nystrom, I had the chance to take part in a flag ceremony at the East Tennessee State Veterans' Cemetery this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| It was a very moving event where every single gravesite in that cemetery had a flag put on it to honor the fallen, and I was really glad to be able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=203)|
| 0:03:36| I would like to start my remarks tonight with a short moment of silence to honor and recognize all of our servicemen and women who have died serving our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=216)|
| 0:03:45| So a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=225)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Okay, so moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| As you all know, the Memorial Day holiday also marks the beginning of the summer season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| and so I'm glad to say that the city's public outdoor pools are now open, and a lot of people came out to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=250)|
| 0:04:19| Director Ely gave me the numbers, and hundreds of people are already starting to use our city pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| The Splash Fountains are also currently open at Volunteer Landing, World's Fair Park, and Crouch Park Extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| and the Fountains in Market Square will be opening later this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Many people have also been asking about the city's Fourth of July plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| With COVID, we weren't sure what the summer would bring, but we are excited to announce a variety of family-friendly outdoor events for the holiday weekend coming up July 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=278)|
| 0:04:48| Festivities will begin at World's Fair Park on Friday, July 2nd with a live concert by the Band of the South, which is the McGee-Tyson Air Force Band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=288)|
| 0:04:57| followed by a brief fireworks show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| And on Saturday, July 3rd, the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra will perform at the World's Fair Park Amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| While this is not our traditional Festival on the Fourth, an event that regularly attracts 60,000-plus people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| we do encourage folks to dine out downtown or bring their own picnic, be outside, listen to live music, and celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| We'll be sharing more details in the weeks to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| I also wanted to congratulate and mark that today is Director Harold Cannon's one-year anniversary of joining my administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| and I want to thank him for his leadership of our engineering department, a very important part of city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| So congratulations, Harold, and one year in, and I'm really pleased with your leadership. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| Other congratulations are in order to recognize all of the Class of 2021 high school graduates who are graduating this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=341)|
| 0:05:51| and I think some started last week, including my own daughters graduating tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| I know it's been a challenging time for the Class of 2021 who ended their junior year abruptly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=355)|
| 0:06:03| and have had their whole senior year in the midst of a pandemic, and they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| They've been resilient, and they've made it through, and so I just want to commend not just the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| but their families and all the teachers and Knox County Schools staff and personnel who've supported them on this important milestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| So congratulations, Class of 2021, on behalf of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| And just as I have in recent meetings, just a reminder about rules of decorum before we move on with tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| Everyone is welcome to be here. I want to ensure that the expectations for this meeting are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| For those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item or during public forum, please sign up with the city recorder, Mr. Johnson, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| If you're speaking in favor or against a specific agenda item, you will be expected to stay on topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| and all discussion should speak directly to the agenda item and the decision-facing council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| Broader comments not specific to the agenda item at hand may be stated by those signed up for public forum at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| Speakers should not use profanity. If speakers fail to adhere to those rules, I will rule you out of order and ask you to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| For those who are listening, please note that there are also rules against disrupting a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| This includes making loud noises or adding additional comments when you are not the designated speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| Passion in politics is understandable, but it is unacceptable to impede the ability of council members to have meaningful discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| or to keep fellow audience members from hearing what council is here to discuss tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Those who do disrupt this meeting by violating these rules, whether as a speaker or an observer, will be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you in advance for respecting these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| That concludes my mayor's report. Are there any reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| Okay, seeing none, let's move on with the agenda item. Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| 8A is resolution confirming the appointment of Cameron Bolin and the reappointment of Rick Blackburn and John Thurman to the Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Motion made and seconded. Is Cameron Bolin in the audience tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| If you could just stand up and just wanted to thank you for being willing to do this. We appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| So there's a motion and a second on the floor. All those in any discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| All those in favor, please say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries unanimously. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| Next item, please. 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Benjamin C. Mullins on behalf of Dr. Todd Stennett of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision to uphold the zoning administrator's interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=506)|
| 0:08:39| described herein for property located at 4605 Central Avenue Pike, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=519)|
| 0:08:50| Okay, thank you. Just a quick reminder for BZA appeals, the appellant can have up to three people, up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=530)|
| 0:09:00| We have two people signed up to speak for and one person signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| You'll have up to five minutes, and if you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you, Mayor. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500, here on behalf of the applicant, Dr. Todd Stennett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| This is an appeal. We're appealing the interpretation of the Knoxville City Codes that our desired 45-foot-tall cross that we're wanting to place on property at 4605 Central Avenue Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=559)|
| 0:09:32| does not qualify as a second principal use on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| Per Section 10 of the zoning ordinance, office zones allow more than one principal use, and the height for any principal use would be up to 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| Now, there's been quite a bit of conversation with the applicants and myself with codes and the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| We've tried to work through these issues, and they've been very positive conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| Ultimately, I think there's just a disagreement that we needed to bring through this process to see if we could get resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| It's plain that this cross is not considered a sign under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| Under Section 13, Article 13 of the zoning ordinance, it would be considered a stand-alone work of art, bearing no advertisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| As such, it is not subject to the restrictions of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| The initial plan was to construct a cross similar to some of the crosses you've seen in other areas of East Tennessee that would be 60 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=624)|
| 0:10:33| Last year, we were working with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| Mr. Berry, and this is in the packet, Brian Berry with the Codes Enforcement, said in a June 17, 2020, email that a sign, by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=638)|
| 0:10:47| still considered a structure according to the city's zoning ordinance, citing Article 2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| He also goes on to say, if a work of art bearing no advertising is exempt from sign regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| it would still be subject to other applicable regulations in the zoning ordinance as a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| And we agree with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| We reduced our plans from 60 feet to 45 feet to be able to meet the height requirements in the office zone for a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=667)|
| 0:11:19| After the plans were revised, we applied for a variance for setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| and then we were told that their interpretation wasn't that this qualified for a principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| but only an accessory use and we limited to 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| They moved forward with the variance application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| It actually came before this body on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| However, that's when I got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| All of the issues that I wanted to raise would not be before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| So we withdrew the application and went back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| So here we are tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| The problem with the interpretation and why we disagree is that the zoning ordinance uses the term structure and building interchangeably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| And if you look at the definition of building under 2.3, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| which is a roof and an enclosing wall for at least half of its perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| So the definition of building does require it to have a roof and a wall and have some structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| some use to it, some occupancy for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| However, the definition of structure is different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| The definition of structure is a combination of materials to form a construction for use or occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| whether installed on, above, or below the surface of land or water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And again, it says use or occupancy, not use and occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| implying that you can have a use that does not require a documency and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| It goes back to what Mr. Berry said, with a sign is a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| but a sign would not qualify as a building under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| So we believe that a principal use can be a structure without there being a use or occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Now, we went and tried to work with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| We went back and tried to redesign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| We put a small building at the base of the cross in some of our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| We had a bathroom that was building code compliant and ADA compliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| to see if we could then work with codes within their interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| and not have to go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| The problem is that substantially increased the cost by over $75,000 to $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| And that just isn't feasible for us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| So that brings us, I guess, segues into the argument that I've raised in my submittals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| and I know the city law department has also provided memos about the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| of the Tennessee's Religious Freedom Preservation Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| And I understand the city law department and I aren't going to see eye to eye on its application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| and we're not asking necessarily to do that, but I do believe it provides context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| because under that act, you know, Dr. Stinnett has a religiously motivated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| sincere religiously motivated purpose for wanting to put this cross in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| And the application of the zoning ordinance is burdening that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| And the definition for substantial burden is simply to inhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| or curtail a religiously motivated practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| And that is occurring here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| Do I still have two minutes for rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| After the other people go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Okay, next speaker is Dr. Stinnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| and you also have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| I am Todd Stinnett, and I live at 8115 Canter Lane in Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=875)|

| 0:14:45| born and raised in Knoxville, and love this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| I want to say good evening to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you for considering the cross this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| My parents are Larry and Jenny Stinnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Larry passed away in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| My mom and dad started Backflow Specialty Company about 26 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| and they've been at their current location on I-75 for more than 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| From the time they moved in, it was on their heart to place a visible cross along the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| encouraging drivers, about 90,000 vehicles a day by that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| and pointing people to their Lord Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| A small unistruck cross outfitted with LED lights was fixed to their back porch for many years, still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Many people have seen it and commented on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| but there's no doubt that many more people would see the cross if it were 45 feet tall in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| just off the interstate setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| I want to say unequivocally that there is no reason that the cross cannot be constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| according to the plans that have been submitted to you here today, and here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| 4605 Central Avenue Pike is zoned office, and as such, it is permitted two principal uses, as Mr. Mullins has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=949)|
| 0:15:58| Clearly, the first use would be Backflow Specialty Company, and the second use would be the cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| which the neighbors, by the way, have given a written approval of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Article 10-1 of the city's zoning ordinance says, in all other districts, including office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| more than one principal building is permitted on a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| provided that all structures comply with the dimensional standards of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| City officials have gotten hung up on the idea that the second principal use must be a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| and as such, it must have occupancy, ADA compliance, and a restroom, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| But the quote I just read directly from the city ordinance proves that building and structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| are used interchangeably throughout the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| For that reason, a structure, in this case a cross, can be the second principal use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| That was the original interpretation given to me about a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| by the city's Deputy Director of Zoning and Development, Brian Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| He agreed that a freestanding structure could be the second principal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| and as such, it could be constructed to 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| But for some reason that was never adequately explained to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| city officials, not Brian Berry, changed their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| and said that the cross could only be constructed to 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| According to state law, in this case the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| the city of Knoxville has to prove that the cross cannot be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| because denying the cross would further a compelling government interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| and it must then prove that denying the cross as planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| It is clear to me, and I hope to you as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| the government has no compelling interest in this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| and even if it did, the least restrictive means has not been chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| As Mr. Mullins has said, converting the cross to a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| would add about $100,000 to the cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| Council members, in light of these facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| I believe that you have a legal obligation to permit the cross as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Otherwise, I believe that you stand in opposition to state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| as it's been set forward in the Preservation of Religious Freedom Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| And in this day of hopelessness and despair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| just think about the many people that could be comforted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and encouraged through the cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| My mom was at the business the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| She took a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| It was a lady who makes the drive every morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| to Tenova North Knox Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| and when this lady drives out, it's usually about 5 a.m. or so, she was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| It's always dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| She said, every time, every time I go by that cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| it reminds me that there's a God that loves me, that I have hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| I want to thank you, Council Member Fugate, today for beginning us with that invocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| and I want to thank you, Mayor, for leading us in that pledge of allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Whether we want to believe it or not, we are one nation under God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| Our community is hurting, struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| My goodness, look at the gun violence in our community since the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| Look at the hate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Look at the division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| What we need is love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| What we need is hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1161)|

| 0:19:30| It is a universal message that says God loves you, and there's hope for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1170)|

| 0:19:38| Thank you, Dr. Stinnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| One person has signed up, a respondent, to speak in opposition is Joyce Felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| Ms. Felt, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and you'll have up to five minutes to address counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| And then, Mr. Mullins, you have up to two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| My name is Joyce Felt, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| and I'm here as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| The applicant appeared before the Board of Zoning Appeals on April 20th, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| to request a variance to erect a freestanding accessory structure that would stand 45 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| However, the zoning ordinance only allows an accessory structure to be built to a maximum height of 18 feet in the office district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| and the variance request was unanimously and appropriately denied by the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| The structure in question does not qualify as a principal building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| because it does not meet the definition for a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| which requires a roof and an enclosing wall for at least half of the perimeter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| and because a use cannot be conducted inside the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| In this situation, the applicant has not claimed a legal hardship as required by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| In spite of claims to the contrary, the lot is not exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1259)|
| 0:21:06| Strict application of the ordinance would not result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| which would deprive the owner of reasonable use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| In fact, the lot is very level, and there's ample room to erect a structure under the dictates of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| Approving this appeal would set an unfortunate precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| and would allow anyone who wants to build a freestanding structure of any kind and at any height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| to use similar arguments to those made here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| The applicant is also claiming that denial of this variance request, or this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| would place a substantial burden on the exercise of his religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| But the applicant is still free to practice his chosen religion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| and there is no infringement on his religious rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| He is also not being denied the ability to construct a structure in the shape of a cross on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| The applicable standards here are content neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| He is merely being asked to adhere to the height and setback requirements specified in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Scenic Knoxville respectfully requests that this appeal be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Mr. Bonds, you now have up to two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Ms. Feld properly read the definition of building which does require a roof and four walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| and also requires occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| A structure does not require a roof and four walls and does not require an occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| The zoning ordinance says repeatedly in these definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| use or occupancy with the conjunction or, not and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| which means you can have use without occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| It has to mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| And if there is more than one way to interpret that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| if there is an ambiguity in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| the state law tells us that when there's ambiguities in interpreting the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| that ambiguity is to inure to the property owner for the free use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| So to the extent there may be an ambiguity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| then I would ask you to employ that maxim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| that legal principle that the courts have repeated over and over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| when looking at these types of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| To further add to maybe some of the ambiguity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| if you look at the definition of principle building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| it says a non-accessory structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| referring back to a structure which does not have to have a roof and four walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| It refers back to a use or occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| And so I think asking us to create occupancy for something that is simply a use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| just like a sign would simply be a use, creates some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| There's another legal issue I raised in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I don't want to go into it in too much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| but I do want to make sure it's preserved for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| The zoning ordinance, Article 10, does say if a use isn't called out as being a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| it's denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| It should be denied under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| And there are some cases where the courts have looked at that and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| well, that creates an issue if you have a use that otherwise would be legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| but is not provided for in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| That raises some issues with regard to the enforceability of the zoning ordinance in that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Again, I don't expect that we're going to solve all those issues today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| I think the most expedient way is to look at this interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| look at the ambiguity between use and occupancy, and grant the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you, Mr. Mons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Counsel, that concludes the people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Our Director of Plans, Reviews, Inspections, Peter Ahrens, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| if you have any questions for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| and Christina Magrans from the Law Department is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| Does anyone have any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Don't forget to use your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Help me by using your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Yes, I would like to hear from Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1503)|
| 0:25:13| Hi, Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans, Reviews, and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| Mr. Ahrens, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| could you explain the process that the BZA went through to reach the decision here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1519)|
| 0:25:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| The BZA went through a process where they evaluated my testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| and my logic for the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| and evaluated that based on what the code says and agreed with my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| I think it's important for this body to know that I don't believe that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| and structure are interchangeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| A building is a type of structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| A sign is a type of structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| But they're not necessarily always the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| There's a lot of different structures out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Not all of them are buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| A deck is not a building because it doesn't have walls and a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| But it is a structure that's regulated by the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| If you look in the zoning code, Article 5, Table 5-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1573)|
| 0:26:24| we do regulate maximum building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And that's really what it's about is the maximum building height, the 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| What was proposed, it's certainly a structure, but it's not a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| And so we have an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| It's accessory to the principal use on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| and that's where we made the determination that 18 feet is the appropriate maximum height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| for what was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Mr. Ernst, was the primary decision in trying to evaluate this structure, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1615)|
| 0:27:03| is whether it was a building or an accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1623)|
| 0:27:12| A building, was that the decision that you made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I made the decision that it was an accessory structure and not a principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| And I think, if I understand correctly, to be declared a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| it would have to have a roof, at least some kind of partial enclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| and then some kind of use within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| The definition of a principal building is a non-accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| in which a principal use on the lot on which it is located is conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| So it's, by definition, it's principal in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| The principal use is conducted inside of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| and it's on the same lot as the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| And so what was proposed doesn't align with anything associated with that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1681)|
| 0:28:11| I understand. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| And, Council Members, just be – are your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Was that inadvertent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| I did have a question, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| I did have a question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| And also, just a reminder, it really helps if everybody gets really close to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| So can you repeat for me what is allowed across?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Is it allowed at how many feet, the structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| As I determined it was an accessory structure, 18 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| So that is all allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| The only issue is the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| So he can have what it is he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Mr. Ahrens, were there in the discussions –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I note here that I know these discussions have been going on for about a year –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| were there other options presented to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| There were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Initially, we identified that if the cross structure was attached in any way to the primary building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| the principal building on the lot, which would be either the building up by the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| or we even went so far as to say that the secondary structure has a principal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| because it's tied with the plumbing business, that they could attach it to that building either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1776)|
| 0:29:47| There was discussion about it becoming a place of worship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| and so we went down that road with them, and that's completely fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| But now we're jumping into the building code, and I don't want to confuse things too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| but once you create a separate principal use as a place of worship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| you're inviting people to the site, you're inviting people to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| and there are building code regulations that you need to follow as well as far as restrooms, accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| The list goes on, and apparently it adds $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Okay, but what I heard you say initially is the cross could be attached to the principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| And that doesn't trigger it as a place of worship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| No, it's part of the primary building's structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Up to 45 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Okay, which would get them the 45-feet height that they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Otherwise they could follow code and not attach it to the building, and it could be 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| So there are options to get to the 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| When we say attach, it's integrating it into the existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| Sure, and I'm looking at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| There's three structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| There's one with the parking spaces to the side of it, which I imagine is the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| the building closest to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| I don't have the map in front of me, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Well, one looks like a shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| They both look like sheds, the one closer to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| So I think I'm clear on which building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| But you can go up to 45 feet and make a cross attached to that building that would be the height that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Just for further clarification, is it attached to any of the three buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| Would that, I mean, now we're getting into if there are three buildings there, based on Ms. Ryder's map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1901)|
| 0:31:53| if they are all three buildings, the primary building, primary use, and it could be attached to any of those three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1913)|
| 0:32:03| I'm just trying to, as though the muddy, the water's not muddy enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| When we evaluated it, we identified two buildings that were principal buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| So I would imagine it would be the larger of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| So either one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| So there are two buildings that are the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Yes, I'd like to hear from the city's attorney about this, about the question about freedom of religion, all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1955)|
| 0:32:48| I know it's a zoning question, but that's been brought up, and I understand you and Mr. Mullins are going to agree to disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| but I would also like to hear the city's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| Yeah, I think that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I respect Mr. Mullins' position a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| He's a fine attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| But in this case, we're just going to have to agree to disagree about what the law requires in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| Christina McGraws in our office has researched this very thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| She has provided each of you, I think, in your packet with a synopsis of the law as it applies to this case, in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=1997)|
| 0:33:28| We do not believe that the city is compelled by virtue of either the PRFA or the RLUIPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2008)|
| 0:33:38| either of those statutes, to grant a 45-foot cross in this instance because there are other options there that were offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2018)|
| 0:33:49| and it does not substantially impair his ability to exercise his religious freedom in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2029)|
| 0:33:59| Because he can have a cross 18 feet for sure, and he can have a cross 45 feet if he simply attaches it to a principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2039)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Just, I guess, a little bit more clarification from Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| Getting into the religious freedom aspect of it, I think, at least according to the memo and the law as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| the plaintiff has a burden to prove – a substantial burden in order to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| I guess I'm somewhat influenced by the memo as well of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| It talks about those three other alternatives that were offered to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| I'm sure that listening to the applicant wants to examine to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| It did seem to be some other – at least some other options other than the one they were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2099)|
| 0:35:09| I understand the sentiments of the applicant, but to me, looking objectively at the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2109)|
| 0:35:17| and I've read the entire record and listened to all the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| it seems to me that the BZA made the correct decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| It seemed to be the crux of the matter was whether this was a building or an accessory structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| and reading the definition of the regulations of a building, I don't think this qualifies as a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| So at this time, respectfully, I raise a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| My motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Okay, motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Director Swanson or Mr. Frost, just trying to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| because I've actually seen a court case lost on a conjunction of and versus or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| Can one of you all speak to Mr. Mullins a little more in depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| and clarify the building or structure versus building and structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| Just clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| There still has to be a use within the structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| If it's going to be a principal structure, it has to be a use within the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| Whether it's an and or an or, there's got to be a use within that structure for it to qualify as a principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| Peter, if I've gotten this wrong, you better come up here and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| I just want to make sure that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2215)|
| 0:37:05| You heard Mr. Mullins' suggestion that the or allowed them to have that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| whether or not there was any use of the structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| That's only accurate if it's a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| If it's a building, the use has to extend into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| It's building versus structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| That's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| A building is a type of structure, but not all structures are buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| We've got works of art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| We issue permits for works of art to make sure that the foundations are good and they don't fall on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| We've got bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| We've got signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| There's a lot of structure types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| That's why they're not interchangeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| They're completely related, but they're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| So just from a purely legal standpoint, is that a factor in distinguishing this cross as a permitted use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2274)|
| 0:38:08| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| I think Mr. Mullins is trying to, and I don't mean to put words in his mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| but he's equating the two, and Mr. Ahrens is disagreeing with calling them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2297)|
| 0:38:26| Mr. Ahrens is putting a finer definition on the two than Mr. Mullins is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2311)|

| 0:43:12| that provide violence prevention and youth enrichment work specifically in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2592)|

| 0:43:32| Yeah, I just wonder if Mr. Ryerson or someone was here to maybe give a little bit more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| for the record of how the funds will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2617)|

| 0:44:07| The goal here is to really direct funds into our East Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| and establish it that the community will determine what happens with these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| So United Way is leveraging our donor base and our role as a convener and a collaborator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| and really handing it off from there so that we have a meeting near the end of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2664)|

| 0:44:51| or how will they be selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| We have a short list of folks that we've reached out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I don't have their names on hand with me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Would you be happy to provide those, I'm sure, when it is set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| If public dollars are going into it, the public needs to know who's on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2709)|

| 0:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| If you could just pass those along to council and me too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| we'd appreciate it when you have that ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah, and this may be a question partly for you and partly for Mr. Lomax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| I know that we also are funding through Cities United kind of a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| to start working on violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| So is this something that will work with and complement versus overlap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Since we're also doing some figuring out of how that's going to lay out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| I believe some of your early meetings are going to be in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| which we're in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| It's just June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2750)|

| 0:45:52| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| It will be in addition to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| It's all a collaborative work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| and so we're taking a multiple prong approach to this work of violence interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=2756)|

| 0:50:36| How much will this change the interface or the app on the user end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| I'm a big fan of that, and I know at the time that it went into play, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3041)|

| 0:50:55| this, so how will this change the app and as well the texting, because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| use the texting some more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| So one of the biggest complaints we have about the mobile app is that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| can't see the bus on the screen in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3065)|

| 0:51:23| arriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| There will still be a text feature available for those that don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3084)|

| 0:51:34| actually using the smart phone and going away from texting, but it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| still be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| So both will be there and the smart phone app will be better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| It's also going to give customers alerts, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| So any route changes we have that day or that week because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| construction or whatnot, it will give them alerts on detours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3111)|
| 0:51:58| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Any other questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3119)|

| 0:52:08| I know there's times back in the past I couldn't ride the bus because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| didn't have exact change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| So those days are hopefully quite a bit behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| I appreciate those efforts and just that one aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| It opens up a whole other world of opportunities for people that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| don't ride the bus every single week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210601?start=3146)|
