| 0:03:30| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Two or three items really quick on Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| First of all, sometime the best we can figure, sometime late tomorrow afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| we think our 311 Center will receive its one millionth call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| which is obviously a very notable milestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| It opened on May 5th, 2005, so four years and four months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| And in that period of time, we've handled, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| almost a million different calls from folks dealing with everything from fixing potholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| to rained out softball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| So it's been a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| I want to congratulate and thank Russ Jensen and their great staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| I mean, I think the fact that one million people have used it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| shows it's a service that our citizens really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| And I appreciate Council stepping out to help us approve that low these many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Mayor, I understand that the 911 calls are down significantly as well since 311 came into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| A conversation with Mr. Jensen recently, he pointed that out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| and that's been perhaps an unexpected benefit but a good one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| There have been multiple benefits, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| Everything from people getting problems solved to people having questions answered quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| And one of those has been a lot fewer non-emergency calls are going to 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| which is obviously a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| So, yeah, thanks for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| A couple other things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| There will be a downtown north public meeting to present a proposed streetscape design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| for parts of Broadway, Central, Gay, and Fifth as they lead into downtown north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| The meeting is 6 p.m. this Thursday at St. John's Lutheran there at the corner of Fifth and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| And the plan identifies possible infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| and aesthetic improvements to those quarters as part of the whole downtown north redevelopment effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| which has made such great progress lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| We're trying to get additional feedback from residents and business owners there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Finally, I want to let you know the City of Knoxville's plan for Knoxville's Affordable LEED Gold Houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| will receive the award for outstanding planning for green development from the Tennessee chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| of the American Planning Association at their upcoming meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| We worked with our community development department and Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| They did a great job on this project and just one of our many initiatives to increase efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| and sustainability in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So, congratulations on winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| That's a really significant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Councilman Hooklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Many people know this, but it's a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| We have an election going on right now, and the polls are open for almost another hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| They close at 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| If anybody is in this audience that hasn't voted, I encourage you to get up and go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Instead of sitting here, it will be more productive, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| And also, if you're watching from home, watching on television, you've got almost an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| So, please, if you haven't voted, vote in the city primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Let me echo the push to go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| It is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| And related to that, I wanted to let council members know that I'm starting some thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| and talking with folks about how we're going to deal with the transition and some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| orientation stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| Hopefully, we'll get a chance to talk to everybody around this table for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| And right now, especially you, the five outgoing folks, a heads up that there's a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| in sort of not just letting you all go, but insisting that you all hang around for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| of the orientation because of the wisdom you've gained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| We want to make sure we do a good job sharing that with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| So, I want to give you a heads up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| For council business, and Ms. Mitchell might correct me if I speak wrong on this, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| we now have set the wayfinding workshop for October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| We are hopefully, we are still in process of discussing a recycling workshop on December 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=425)|
| 0:07:14| And there are a few people who have not responded yet to the emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| And we've got two emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| The next one becomes a visit by a large person to insist that you decide whether you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| So, please respond to the emails and let us know if we can have that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=451)|

| 0:10:14| Mayor Haslam, this is just a moment to reflect quickly that this is Knoxville's newest neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=614)|
| 0:10:23| and it may prove to be Knoxville's biggest neighborhood at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| And it's very interesting, as some of us have been here five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| And we stood in the empty shell of a building on Gay Street about seven and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| And as I recall, it was below 10 degrees that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| We were commenting on this the other day when we had our little meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| I just reflected at the time Mayor Ash asked us to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Well, it scared me to death because I'd never said anything in a council gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| So I didn't know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| But at the time I said, gosh, you know, he was such an advocate of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| So I said, hey, I said, you know, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| This is Knoxville's newest neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| And I think it has been absolutely an incredible experience in the last seven and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| to watch our neighborhood grow and downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| And so I just wanted to reflect on that because I think sometimes we don't recognize the real interesting components of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| And every neighborhood is not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| And I just love it that this is such a unique and such a viable and such a busy growing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| So my best to the CBID and all they have done to participate in watching that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=699)|

| 0:13:39| And that's true, Mr. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Yes, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| This is just for preliminary work, and we don't have the rest of the funding yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| but we hope we'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Councilman Hollis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| That's an important point, Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| but of course the flip side of that coin is that it's an important project to get started on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| and this will enable us to begin the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| and we don't even know yet what that design process will look like in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| There's been talk about a national or international design competition that may or may not materialize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| but it's something that we want to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| I think most of us do, if not all of us in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| and it has the opportunity, creates the opportunity for us to build a signature element,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| not only a pedestrian bridge, but something that will be visually striking, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| or appropriate for that kind of application, and has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| So I think it's an exciting opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=883)|

| 0:15:56| I'm not sure who to ask this question to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Maybe Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Go ahead and ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Hopefully we're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Yeah, and we'll try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Is there an increased cost to the city to have PBA take on the additional maintenance of this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| I'm going to let Mr. Martin take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Councilmember Roddy, we think that's going to be minor in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| This was principally to allow PBA to do some work that we needed to do to that building to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| in regard to the roof, which had to be done, and a little bit early on the HVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| but would have been expense we would have had to have done at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| So by making this part of our operating agreement with PBA gives them the authorization to go forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| and conduct that work under that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| As far as any other incremental expense to the operating of the building going forth while CAT is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| which will be for approximately a year, will be charged to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1018)|

| 0:19:24| Well, I don't think there's any more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Just that this rescission is nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| That's why it's $8.7 billion taken from all the State DOTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| But it hurts us all because transportation dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1173)|

| 0:19:40| and then take back the other with rescissions on transportation funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| So this is asking Congress just to be very straightforward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1183)|

| 0:19:52| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Ordinance 12A is an ordinance to amend Section 20-60 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| so as to lead from the provisions prohibiting the use of possession of firearms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| or weapons within city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Requested by Council Member Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| There are, let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six people signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| One, two, three, four against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| What council has kind of wished in the past is we keep our overall 15-minute time limit for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1224)|
| 0:20:34| Basically, the rules of council provide for three people on each side of an issue to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Those in favor first, three people get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Those against, three people get five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| And then those in favor get a two-minute rebuttal after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| That's the rules of council regardless of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| I think what council has historically been doing for the last several meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| whenever more people have signed up and fit into that limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| is to say we'd like to keep the overall limits of time argued on both sides at the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| But if multiple people want to sign up to speak within that time frame, we will work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| So I'm seeing mostly nodded heads from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Does anybody have a problem with that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| We will send here from those in favor first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| And I'll read the order that people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| Richard Smith, then Mike Mullenauer, Liston Matthews, then Douglas Dutton, then Chris Kerr, then John Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1280)|
| 0:21:29| And we'd ask, like I said, if you'd keep the total of the six of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| if you could keep that to 15 minutes or under, that would be most appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| And everyone who's so that would be first is Richard Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| And if everyone would just, the rules of council, if you would give us your name and address before you start, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Richard Smith, 420 Ranger Lane, Knoxville 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| Thank you for the opportunity to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| I want to share that I am here to support the U.S. Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| and I include the amendments, particularly in this case the second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| And I want to thank Steve Hall for proposing this ordinance to amend the current city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| to bring it in line with the laws or regulations in our national park, particularly the Smoky Mountain National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1336)|
| 0:22:27| I do have a carry permit, and I'm permitted to carry in the national park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1347)|
| 0:22:35| and most everywhere in the city of Knoxville, on the streets, in the market square, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1355)|
| 0:22:44| And even on the sidewalks in front of various private properties that have given easements for greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1364)|
| 0:22:55| But I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| And also, being a responsible citizen of the Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| I don't go into any location with a handgun that I would not go in without a handgun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1384)|
| 0:23:15| And we talked in great detail on this during the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| that we do have opportunities to stay safe and that drawing a handgun is not the first line of defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1400)|
| 0:23:32| What I want to say is that I would hope that you would vote to uphold our constitutional rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1412)|
| 0:23:42| It seems that the Constitution is under siege in a variety of different parts of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| and I would hope that you would not opt out of the U.S. Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Mike Mullenauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| Good evening, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Many of us were here for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| I'm sorry, I need your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Mike Mullenauer, 106 Mayflower Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, and thank you for the reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Most of us, I think, were here, well, many of us were here for the workshop that Council held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| which was very thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| And I think you've heard most of the fact arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| You've probably heard the micro-level arguments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| So my intention for the next couple of minutes is not to retread all of those arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| Ms. Pelo mentioned something in her prayer that I think it piqued my attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| and Ms. Pelo, you alluded to the fact that we've got people who care about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| And I'm operating from the premise here that everybody in the room would like for the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| and the rest of the city, as far as that's concerned, to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| There's nobody in this room that is for unsafe parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| So how in the world is it that people reason to completely different positions on any particular legal question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| and in this case, of course, a very precise ordinance that's on the books already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| But more broadly than that, it's not just the parks ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| How is it that people differ on this position of whether or not it is reasonable and sensible to carry a gun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1516)|
| 0:25:27| I'd like to address a couple of instances that are real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| These aren't conjured up and these aren't hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| This is not some hypothetical speculation that someone someday in a park might go off with a gun and shoot somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1534)|
| 0:25:44| And the reason I want to address these things is that my side of the argument looks at this situation and says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| We live in a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| The probability of being a crime victim in this city is relatively low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| We are generally safe in the city and in our parks, but we're not completely safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| And as much as this council and the chief of police and all of the police force and the sheriff's department might want to prevent crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1564)|
| 0:26:16| it is absolutely impossible for the council to look out here and foresee these things happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| and stop all crime and all attacks before they take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| If we could do that, we would declare every place safe and we'd be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| Here are some of the places where we thought we should be safe and we thought we were safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Interstate 81 at the Bailey Rest Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| And I'm referring here to the murder of the Lillilid family by a gang of renegade teenagers on a killing spree out of Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| if you remember that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Entire family except for one little survivor child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| We've searched sanctuaries not only here in our own town, but all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| You would think you would be safe there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| And you are relatively generally safe there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1624)|
| 0:27:12| The gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| My wife and I, not as regularly as we would like to, but go to a gym in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| It's 24-7 access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| You've got a card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| The door can lock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| We feel relatively safe there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| As you all know, only a few weeks ago right here this summer in Pittsburgh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| a deranged killer breaks into a gym and shoots a number of people inside the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| They thought they were safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| They always were before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| The crime rate in the gym had before been probably 0%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| The State Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| And yet we read, was it last week only, that there's a criminally insane murderer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| who's taken on a field trip to a State Fair and walks off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| That's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| You see my point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| As much as we would all like to be safe, and I know, Mr. Becker, you rely on the statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| because you've cited those statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| and you're correct that the relative crime rate in the city and in the parks in general is low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| It's not nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| I was concerned when I heard the officer say that there were over 100 incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| during the examined time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I was surprised that there were 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| I'm concerned about those 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Now, they weren't all violent crimes, but we didn't really hear about which ones were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| and which ones weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Personally, I've mentioned this several times, and I don't seem to get any traction with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| This summer I met with my son for lunch at Ruby Tuesdays in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| right out by Chapman Highway near Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| And while we were getting our burgers at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| I see a knife point carjacking unfold in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Now, I have four kids, three living in town, two daughters-in-law, two grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| and one on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Instead of the woman who was arriving in that parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| it could have been one of my daughters-in-law with the child in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| Are we safe in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Do I go back to Ruby's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Of course I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| We are relatively generally quite safe there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| but we cannot guarantee our safety in any of these places to include the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| So what's going on with this particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I have to infer that generally the opponents of the right to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| really aren't comfortable with firearms, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| or the citizens' right to keep and bear arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| There are going to be exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| But that's what I think is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| So given the low probability of being personally attacked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| with devastating consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| is the Council telling handgun carry permit holders that it's unreasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| or irrational or unsafe just to carry a gun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| And if so, what's backing that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| That's the question that I would leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Well, anyway, it has been a spirited debate, and it's been a good one, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Let's see, Liston Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| Mr. Mayor, members of the Council, I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| My name is Liston Matthews, 10017 Madison Ridge Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| I do appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| And I just wanted to address this from the civil rights viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| The most fundamental civil right of all is the right to self-preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| Without that right, you have nothing, I have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| This parks ban denies that basic fundamental right without providing any security to park goers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| Now, when I came into this building, I had to go through security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| and there's an officer standing back there right now, and we've got the chief over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| And this officer is providing some measure of security for this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| and there may be other officers about, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| But there is some security here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| I cannot recall but one time in the last five years when I've been in a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| when there was a police officer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| So that means that the officers were not providing any security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| Okay, the Romans and Jesus didn't mind somebody carrying a weapon into a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| I don't think we should mind it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| Constitutional law changes over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| and we have gone from a position of having the Dred Scott decision post-Civil War| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| in which an African American had no citizenship rights, including the right to keep and bear arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| until recently the Heller decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| recognized an individual right to keep and bear arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| Now, the question for you here is, will you overturn this unconstitutional ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| or will you wait and let the Supremes do it for you sometime in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| And the other question that I have to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| does the right to self-preservation have to continue to stay at the back of the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| while we're here in the parks of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Mr. Dutton, there's five more minutes left on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1955)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I'm Douglas Dutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| I have business property at 617 Main Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| I live at 12031 South Foxton Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| I appreciate the time that you all have given to this issue with the last meeting, the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| and all the time that you've given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| But I want to point out that too much of that time has been spent, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| on emotion and anecdotes instead of looking at facts and evidence on which to make your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1987)|
| 0:33:15| and your deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| This ordinance that we're talking about, apparently nobody knew about it for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| I guess Ms. Poplin found it when we first brought this up, so it's not had much effect in all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| But the overriding issue of the ban on state parks by the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| the emotion has been that everybody's doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| All the cities are opting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Well, the facts are that 70 cities and counties have opted out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| and there are 442 cities and counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| So 15% of the cities and counties have actually opted out of the state ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| So it's not a steamroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| It's not a groundswell of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| It's just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| So 85% of the cities and counties find no problem with this state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| that was debated at length in the state legislature and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| The second issue that's gone, if not overtly, it certainly has been undercurrent that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2057)|
| 0:34:25| and it only applies to us, handgun carrier permit holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| is that we might be able to carry our weapons in city parks and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| And it's been implied that we're a bunch of lawbreakers, that we can't be trusted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| that we're psychologically unbalanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| that we're going to start shooting the umpires at the Little League games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| Facts, again, instead of emotion and anecdotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| facts are that in 2008 there were 263 handgun carrier permits revoked out of approximately 250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2090)|
| 0:35:01| And those revocations were for many things, not just gun law violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| I couldn't find the facts on the breakdown, but I know protective orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| many things can cause you to lose your handgun carrier permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| So there's been one out of each thousand handgun carrier permit owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| have lost their permit because of a violation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| So those are two facts that I want you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| The third thing is about emotion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Mrs. Pelo offended me, and I'm sure offended many gun owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| with the comments attributed to her in the Knoxville News Sentinel on September 17th of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| when she said she received ugly, threatening, anonymous e-mail messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| and she said she received as many as 400 e-mail messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| mostly anonymous and opposing the prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| But she didn't save those e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Why in the world, if you were threatened, didn't you save them and turn it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| It's a federal crime, 18 U.S.C. 875, to send a threatening e-mail in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| So if they were so dire and so many of them, why didn't you save them and report them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| and have them investigated, even anonymously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Authorities can find where they came from, and if you were really threatened, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| you could have had that searched and found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| So why was this brought into this discourse, this recent discourse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Why did you bring in this emotional, outrageous implication about handgun carry permit owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| You even said, according to the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| it made me think strongly about what kind of training do these permit holders have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| Do they go back for renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| These people don't have psychological testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| The passion and intensity of these e-mails made me think some very bad choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| could be made by these people who have permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| The tone is so threatening, I felt very threatened personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| So you're implying that handgun carry permit holders are all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| and you've attacked the entire handgun carry permit program in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| by your implications and your accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Mr. Dutton, that's the end of the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| I'll let you finish up your remarks, and I'll let the other two who are sound to speak speak very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| if you want to finish up real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| So it's disappointing to me that you would bring that kind of emotion and charges into this debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| instead of a reasoned discourse, which is what we expected from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Mr. Kerr, or Chris Kerr and John Sparks, if you could keep it to a very brief point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Like I said, we're trying to keep the total minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| but I know counsel wants to let everybody that signed up to speak speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| If you would both just hit the high point real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| I'm Chris Kerr, 3801 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Thanks for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| I love the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| I also have a sort of utopian vision for the world, which we're all striving for, safer parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| And the Second Amendment, I think, helps that in its checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| I just want to thank young people for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I want to see some young people get out and protest something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| I think we've kind of become a very sedate TV, Internet sort of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| And it's great to see you children out here, and I'll straighten you out after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| But I have a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| He had to stay over in India for a month because he had a friend who had a home invasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| He was beat with a stick with a nail in it, and unfortunately he died last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| so my friend was able to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| So just from a logical standpoint, I just wanted to throw out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| there's all this excitement about guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Even myself, someone who grew up around guns, found myself getting scared of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| because of the images, gun, bad thing, gun, bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| So I've kind of had to reset my gear, and I protect my family that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| All right, here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Mr. Sparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| John Sparks, 1617 Gillespie Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you, Councilman and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| I'm here really on behalf of my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| He's 80 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| There's not too many sidewalks, and they're not in very good shape for him to use with his walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| He's got liver cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| I'm trying to take care of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| He used to walk through the park, but right now we're having people being held up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| Don't want guns in your parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| You've already got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| But it's not the ones that you want to have the guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| My dad doesn't go anywhere now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| He stays at the house, and his health is suffering because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| So that is why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| I'm speaking for him because I love my dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| and I hope people realize, you know, even those that are younger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| you'll be taking care of your parents when they get older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Where are they going to walk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| We're having problems with the leash laws and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| He can't walk on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| So he walks the parks, and now we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| And this stuff's been getting out in the Sentinel and stuff, and they're getting to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| For criminals, I found out a reading, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| It's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Okay, now we'll move to those speaking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| The first signed up to speak is Carol Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Again, a reminder to everybody, this side will have 15 minutes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| and if you'd begin with your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2429)|
| 0:40:38| Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| On behalf of the Board of Directors of Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| I'd like to urge the City Council to uphold the existing ordinance that prohibits guns in city parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| Through your workshops, research, and public input, you've heard all the compelling reasons to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| Public safety is concerned in parks with large crowds where heated confrontations can occur and children are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| Many greenways that we have have connections with schools and libraries where guns are not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Enforcement of a new city ordinance would be difficult for city police at best and confusing for the public at worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Our parks host youth and school events that have policies that prohibit guns at those events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| Crime rates are low in our city parks and on our greenways, where the ban has been in existence for almost 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| Many greenways are on private property whose landowners provide easements in good faith under the existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| Seventy local governments, including Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| either pass gun bans or have existing bans, which would probably be the equivalent of about 80% of the population of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| Those are the issues you've already heard through all of your workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| Everyday policymakers make decisions that require balancing individual wishes with the greater public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| We currently prohibit guns in schools, airports, civic buildings, and public events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| because leaders such as yourself felt that the potential for harm to the public outweighs the individual need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| Our constitutional rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, the right to bear arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| are all framed within the context of serving the greater public good and all have regulations that assure those goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| There is no compelling reason to allow guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| There is a potential for greater harm to the public good by doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| We urge you to uphold the existing ordinance that prohibits guns in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Carol, you said one thing that I didn't quite understand part of that in the statements that you read about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| the ordinance causing more difficulty with the police to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Could you restate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| I really didn't understand what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| And that really relates to the existence of where greenways occur in connections with other city buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| with schools, with the intersection of the county parks and crowning greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| For example, the 10-mile greenway would be a connection of the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| If the county and the city don't have the same ordinances, then you have an enforcement issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| of where does a gun be permitted and not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| And so it becomes confusing for the public as well as law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| On that particular issue, are you suggesting that we wait until the county rules makes their decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| Because in my opinion, the county is probably going to not opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| It's going to be a very close vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| So should we wait and make our decision so it will coincide with the county's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| Our position would be we would urge you to do so tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| and we will be in front of the county commission as well urging them to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Kyle Tharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Yes, Kyle Tharp, 1300 Bridge Avenue, Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I'm a UT student, social work major, and for the record, I believe there's no children in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| so we're all of age, 18 years old or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| I'm 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| I'd like to start out by saying I love this city a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I use the parks almost every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| I'm a runner, biker, kayaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| I know tons of friends, and a lot of my friends here in the audience use the parks also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| Thankfully, I've never witnessed a violent crime in this city in my entire life, and I've lived here all 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| I know one of the local government's responsibilities is to protect all of its people against violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| and I somehow don't get the connection between more guns and less violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| I support the Second Amendment, but also believe in common sense, reasonable restrictions for places and places of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2681)|
| 0:44:51| For example, I believe it's common sense that we not allow guns near our playgrounds, churches, and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| I just can't see how anyone would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Over 70 towns, as someone has already said tonight, over 70 towns and cities, counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| have put this ban in place in the past couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Someone said that that was 15 percent of the counties, but I believe a lot of them have not had the chance to vote on this yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2712)|
| 0:45:19| so it's maybe much more than 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| The ban has been in place in this city for over 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| and police say that crime has been low in the parks, as you all have already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| So I would like to urge you all to vote to uphold this ban and keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| Betty Scholl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2738)|
| 0:45:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Betty Scholl, 1721 Bonita Drive, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| And I thank you for the opportunity to speak again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| I was here at the meeting on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| Again, on behalf of Knox Greenways Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I'd like to restate our opposition to lifting the ban on guns in parks and greenways, which are considered linear parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| Our stand is consistent with that of Knox County Greenways Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| as well as the Knox County Parks and Recreation Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| We believe that lifting the ban would simply increase the general safety of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| We believe that you really need to keep in mind that guns in parks and greenways are a risk to the public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| Keep in mind that often schools and churches are adjacent to parks and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| This ban has been in effect for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| It's been effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| We don't see that there is really a legitimate reason to revoke that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| So we ask you to vote in favor of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Keep the ban in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| And Eleanor Ripley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| I'm Eleanor Ripley, 4612 Lyons View Park, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| I've never spoken before you guys, and I'm really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| So smile at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| Make me feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| I'm opposed to guns in parks because I think it's dangerous, and I would like for you to consider something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| I want you to vote with your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| If you vote for guns in parks, can you vote for guns in schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| How about guns in this meeting every time you meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| How would you feel if you looked out here in this audience and knew that there was 12 or 15 guns in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Not the police, but in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| How would that make you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| And I was in the schools here in Knoxville, public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| It would have scared me if I had known that people were walking in my school with guns as a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| So vote with your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| If you can vote for guns in schools and in this meeting, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| If you can't, don't vote for them in the parks, because that's where it's going to lead to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Now, one member of those who are speaking in favor have two minutes for a response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| and I know you probably didn't have a chance to get together between yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| but if you want to self-elect somebody, but you have two minutes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Mr. Milner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and I can be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| I listened very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Here's what I did not hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| I did not hear anything backing up the unfounded concern, the unfounded emotional concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2917)|
| 0:48:50| that somehow repealing this ordinance, which would do nothing more than allow handgun carry permit holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| to carry in parks, was for real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| I didn't hear any statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| I didn't hear any discussion, actually, that would indicate to this city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2943)|
| 0:49:10| that there's anything behind the arguments other than I'm concerned about safety in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Now, that is a very legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| We are all concerned about safety in the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| but I would like to hear something that backs up those assertions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| because otherwise you're being asked to rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| If you're inclined to vote against Mr. Hall's motion, you're being asked to rule on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| Basically, on the basis of things like this, I think guns in parks are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| I hear no compelling reason to repeal the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| The legal test, if this really is a constitutional right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| is that the state or the city government as well must have a compelling interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| in closely tailoring an ordinance before you infringe on a constitutional right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| So, that concern reverses the way the council should think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| So, we're asking you to, in the spirit of the expansion of the right to keep and bear arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| do basically what the state general assembly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| We can carry weapons now in state parks and national parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| Let's try it in the city and county parks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Probably like every member of council has done, they haven't taken into account only what's been said and heard here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3030)|
| 0:50:39| They've taken into account the workshops, the emails, the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| I mean, you know, in some regard, you know, as I say to some folks who are on the opposite side of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| as I am, to be blunt, if this ban is repealed, I do not think the Wild West is going to break out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3051)|
| 0:51:00| Conversely, if the ban remains in place, I don't think our parks and our greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| and the boogeyman is behind every tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| It's kind of like a fact pattern that leads to a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| a change in a fact that one place along the road in that fact pattern affects how you wish the outcome would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3076)|
| 0:51:27| My father, late father, owned weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| I've inherited a number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Relatives in law enforcement, I know how to use a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| But I'm at a loss to fully agree with the notion that this should be allowed in our parks and our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3096)|
| 0:51:50| This council, you know, one of the first things anybody on this council did was make a hard zoning decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| A zoning decision is a little bit like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Because the zoning battle, because quite frankly that's what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| it's over what one person wants to do with their property, their property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| And it becomes the position of this council to determine, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| does this person get to exercise their property rights in the way, in the manner, in the means that they see fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3136)|
| 0:52:24| or using the reasonable restrictions which are permitted by local ordinance and state law, can that be not granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3144)|
| 0:52:36| We're in a similar situation in that the current state law allows local governments to opt out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3156)|
| 0:52:46| and there's this specific exclusion for ordinances such as the city of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| that have been in place for a certain period of time to remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| I've, you know, emailed back and forth with people and say, well, if the city of Knoxville, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| opts out of the state law, well, that criminalizes the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| What the city ordinance does that's presently in place is a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| And, you know, opting out of the state law is a misdemeanor punishable up to 11 months and 29 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| and I believe there's a fine to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| I'm concerned that the people who do have private property where easements exist for whether it's a park or a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3208)|
| 0:53:39| or in some case we have city parks that are actually located on private property, how those people will feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| Some may be perfectly fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Others may not be perfectly fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| And what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I mean, do you get into property rights issue again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| And I have a concern that that could create a hodgepodge of greenways for the city and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| likewise for the county as that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| So I think this council has heard a lot sufficient information from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| Respectfully disagree with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| I've enjoyed the conversations and e-mail exchanges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| but I think in my heart as I left the ball field before coming here tonight that there's a time and a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| and that this is neither the time nor the place to allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I guess two things first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| I just need to apologize for some of what happened at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| I sort of inadvertently implied that police officers were on one side of this issue when they were just there to provide information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3289)|
| 0:54:59| and that was a mistake on my part, and I want to be clear on that to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| And I want to pick up and kind of agree with Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| especially about his comment that if this ban is repealed, the Wild West isn't going to break out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| I mean, I think that to sort of paraphrase Mr. Molenauer, by and large, the gun owners in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3311)|
| 0:55:18| the legitimate ones, are an extremely safe bunch by and large, are good folks, are well trained, are going to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3318)|
| 0:55:26| But that doesn't mean that while we were having that workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| one of them, a legitimate gun owner in this city, didn't pull the gun out and wave it at a fellow driver up in Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| There are some bad apples on every side of this equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| And I think as far as the reason to continue this ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| we have got some very good crime statistics that talk about how incredibly safe the parks are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| and it hits me that changing that would be really stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| We've got, I mean, you mentioned you've never seen a violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| Well, they don't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| They're incredibly rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| Changing anything that is that successful sounds a bad plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| It ain't broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| We shouldn't be fixing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Well, there's been some comments tonight about property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| about some of these greenways going across private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| It's my understanding, and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| that if I have a carry permit, that I could walk down Kingston Park on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| and I would be going across a lot of private property because they have an easement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| or any other sidewalk in the city of Knoxville, and I would be legal doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| Now, the property owner may or may not object to me carrying a firearm up and down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| and I can legally do that, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| There may be at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| So that particular issue really doesn't hold a whole lot of water with me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| But I guess it's pretty evident what side of this issue I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| But, you know, if one crime can be prevented, if one rape, one armed robbery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| one murder or something by us enabling people who have a handgun carry permit to go armed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| I think it is worth the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| We haven't, you know, Knox County, for 22 days, you could legally carry in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| I haven't heard a thing about anybody being killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| or them having gunfights or anything else of the stuff that we hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| And since September the 1st, until they do something to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| you can legally carry a gun in a Knox County park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| And this is an issue that's going to be coming up in Knox County before long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| But I agree with, and I know the things that can be said about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| just because the county does one thing doesn't necessarily mean we have to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| I do think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| I think it is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| I think it's personal safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| People need to be able to defend themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| And I do know that we have a small amount of crime that has been reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| But a lot of these crimes that I hope that are prevented are probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| when it comes to sexual assaults, those are probably the most underreported crimes that there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| And how many of those are occurring that we don't know about that could be prevented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3513)|
| 0:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Councilman Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Go ahead, and then I'll go back to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| I disagree with Councilman Becker that it would be stupid if he voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| That's probably not what you meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| That somehow if you supported this ordinance that that would be dumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| I kind of fall in line with what Councilman Frost indicates, that either way has some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3543)|
| 0:59:12| And I've thoroughly appreciated meeting the people in this process of learning more about permitting and handling a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3552)|
| 0:59:23| It's been a good experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| I think what makes this complicated is what makes us unique as a culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| in that we both have a respect for the Second Amendment in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| and we also have a high degree of civility and friendliness and neighborliness within the same person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| that that's who we are as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| And I don't see it as one side against the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| However, I do think, though, that it is our custom to not interfere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| and introduce ordinances and change things when the well-being of our community life seems to be going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3600)|
| 1:00:09| And from what I can see, from my standpoint, it's not about am I for the Second Amendment, which I am in favor of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3609)|
| 1:00:21| but I'm also in favor of supporting civility and neighborliness and mutual care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| and I see that happening in our greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| I've had a personal experience of living in Mechanicsville when College Homes was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| and our safety depended upon our neighborliness, and we were able to move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| So I agree with what I hear Councilman Becker say, and leave well enough alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| It's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Over the six years that I've been here on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| I have not had people telling me that I needed to pay attention to what's going on on our greenways, not once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3654)|
| 1:01:04| And I know things have happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| So for that reasoning, I'm going to not support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, I listened to the very first two speakers tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| and both of them said some things that piqued my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| The first one talked about the Second Amendment and his constitutional rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| It's interesting when one reads the Second Amendment to see what it really says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3696)|
| 1:01:44| It says, a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3704)|
| 1:01:52| the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| One must remember that that amendment was ratified December 15, 1791,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| the same year the city of Knoxville was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| It was done because the pesky British were always breathing down our necks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| We had no real military, and we needed our citizens to be armed to protect our interest and our welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3737)|
| 1:02:27| And still the British came back in 1812 and burned the White House down in 1814.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| Today we don't need that militia with armed private citizens because we have a police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| we have a sheriff's department, we have the highway patrol, we have the U.S. military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| and we have the National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| As to the second point I heard tonight, the gentleman said there are opponents to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3772)|
| 1:02:59| to carrying guns because people, what was the wording, are not comfortable with bearing arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3779)|
| 1:03:07| Well, I must say to you that I learned to shoot guns when I was 12 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| Uncle Sam taught me to be an expert with weaponry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| I'm an expert target shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| At one time I owned a very fine collection of guns until my house was burglarized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| and people took those guns from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| Today I still have some weapons, and before the ammunition shortage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| I bought up a lot of it to do target shooting, and I still have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| So I'm certainly not one who's afraid of guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| but I don't understand this mania with guns in bars and guns in parks and guns everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| And if somebody really explains to me the mania, I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| I appreciate all the remarks from my colleagues and those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| and I really appreciate the fact that we can agree or disagree in a civil way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| I just wanted to, first of all, point out that, as I said in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| and I'm not going to repeat all the things I said in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| that from where I sit as a council member, I try to look at, you know, about the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| And as I've looked into this, and I appreciate Councilman Booker's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| and I've asked questions and I've talked to attorneys about this Second Amendment right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| this right to defend ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| And I think it is our constitutional right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| And so I believe that this is, you know, I'm going to support the repeal because I believe it's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| And I've also looked at some of the court rulings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| and I've talked to some people I would consider scholars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| and I think that just about all of the federal court rulings support the right to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| And so the Constitution allows for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| The federal court rulings support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| One of the things that I, after, and just to bring up this sort of mania, because I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| guns in bars, guns in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| I questioned and brought this up in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Well, who named it guns in the bars and guns in the parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| And it's the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| Not that the media is all bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| but I think it ought to be more called, you know, the right to carry or the right to bear arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| or the right to defend yourself because I look at the folks that have these permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| and I look at the process they go through, the background check that they go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| and then their training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| And then if you talk to them and you ask them questions because you're concerned about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| you'll find that they are seriously, they're serious about their right to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| And when we talk about going down a greenway into a school yard, you know, you ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| well, what are you going to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| They say, well, I'm not going to go into the school grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| And they're serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| They're trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| They're responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| They're thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| And then the most important thing when you get past all of that are the facts and the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3986)|
| 1:06:33| And I have them and I've looked at them and I've researched them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| and to me they all point to the fact that where you have the right to carry laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| and where these new states have enacted the right to carry, crime goes down in just about every statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| And so I'm not afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| I think that when you have responsible gun carriers in certain areas, in parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| it makes those areas a more safe environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| And that's one of the key reasons I'm going to support this and not less safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| And I really haven't heard any compelling arguments or any facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| or statistics that would lead otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| So I'm going to support the repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| This has been a really interesting debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| And I said, and some people may have seen my quote in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| one of the frustrations I've had is sort of the polarization that's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| and people seem to be talking past each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| I've had a chance to hear from people that I know and respect on both sides of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| and respect tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| In most cases, I had no idea that they had a particular position or stake in this argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| especially on the pro-carry side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| People have been in contact with me and communicated with me that I knew and respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| and really had no idea that these folks were, that this was an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| that they were carry permit holders, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| This is one of those issues that most of us don't deal with most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| And unlike zoning, this is something that just kind of, it's not out of left field by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| but it's something we've not been dealing with on any basis historically on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| So it's been, I think, educational for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| We've all learned a lot, as was alluded to earlier in some of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| And I've really been torn about how to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| And one of my great frustrations, again, to be repetitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| is that I hear people making arguments on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| And, again, they seem to be talking past each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| I don't hear any, I don't hear what I consider adequate response to the arguments in some cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4125)|
| 1:08:54| that the other side is making by people that are making counterarguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| And I would like to see somehow that there be real communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| I don't know if that's possible with an issue like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| where people would actually debate this issue amongst themselves and present arguments and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| okay, this is why I believe, tell me why you think I'm wrong and vice versa, and let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4154)|
| 1:09:24| Because of that, well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| I'm not convinced that the present ordinance is a huge burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| although I know that people don't want to violate the law, even if it's a city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| If someone were to be walking along a sidewalk and step onto a greenway, by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| in some cases those lines are blurred, and I would give Sutherland Avenue as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| When it's asphalt, it's a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| When it's concrete, is it a sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I mean, how are we going to determine that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Because it's essentially a pedestrian facility outside of the street lanes and the curb running along that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4200)|
| 1:10:08| So if there were, we can be sure it's a sidewalk, then we know that it's legal if it's on a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4208)|
| 1:10:16| And however that's going to be defined, and it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Going back to Carol Evans' point, no matter how you look at this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| and which side you come down on, there are going to be some clarification issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| But without prolonging it too much, I would prefer to see it tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| I'm not sure if there's support for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| I'm going to make that motion in a moment, but I will say that if that were to fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| I will probably vote in favor of this on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| If it makes it to a second reading, I'm not so sure I would vote for it on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| Just, again, to try to find some way to get these very disparate opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| that don't seem to be jiving with each other at all in terms of statements of fact, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| to find some way that those people would actually talk to each other and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| okay, well, why do you believe this and why are you stating that as a fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| Here are the facts that I believe exist and get that kind of dialogue going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| So, with that said, I am going to make a motion to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| Okay, the motion on the floor is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Mr. Honquist, could you explain more to me about what you hope to accomplish by tabling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| and explain to the body at large what a tabling motion means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| A tabling motion under Robert's Rules of Order is not a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| It has the same effect on one level as a postponement, but it's to a time uncertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| It simply takes the motion off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| The motion is out there and can be, or the item, in this case an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| is still there and can be put back on the table by a separate vote of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| But all it does is it's a way of saying we're not ready to throw this out altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| or to write it off or to vote one way or the other and make a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| We want to put it off the table for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| So, the other part of your question, Councilman Narati,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| I had said before to this body that I can see the opportunity to create a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| or task force and put people from both sides of the issue on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| and essentially if they're willing to serve then they're forced to talk to each other about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| Now, I don't have time, as I said before, to chair that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| and so it may seem somewhat irresponsible of me to suggest it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| because I'm chairing too many of those things right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| But perhaps somebody else on this body or someone else would agree to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| I think it might or might not be productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| It might be something that some of these folks who have spoken tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| would be willing to be involved in or they might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| But the opportunity, in my mind, is there whether it's availed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4384)|
| 1:13:12| The motion on the floor is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Is this to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| I really had not lied on before the motion to table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| so somebody will have to tell me if I'm in order to speak to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| We probably need to deal with that motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| I was afraid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| And then we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Frankly, we had not all had an opportunity to speak, so basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| Well, right now we don't have a second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Well, I guess I get the opportunity to speak whether it's wise or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| And I do want to comment in regard to the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4430)|
| 1:13:59| I think my name's come up several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| And that's fine because it's not a problem for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| I feel quite ready to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| And it is not because I had a preconceived intention to vote either for or against the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4453)|
| 1:14:24| In fact, when the initial conversation came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| and that was actually when the legislature was considering this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| I believe that it might have come up at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| And my husband and I often debate a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| And this was one where we did not agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| And I try to wisely listen to him because usually it's good advice I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| But he and I did not agree on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| And I began to think a great deal and, very frankly, changed my mind completely on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4491)|
| 1:15:00| and was very concerned that the Constitution, I think, is dear to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| And I was very concerned about taking a position which did not agree with our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| And then, as our wise Councilman Booker read to us, I considered what the Constitution really said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4513)|
| 1:15:21| And I didn't consider the historical perspective that he laid out for us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| But I went 180 degrees from my original position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| I feel a tremendous responsibility, and I have conveyed that to almost everyone who has e-mailed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| I think I've answered every e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| I certainly hope I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| I apologized to Giles tonight because I never got back to him on his e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| And he's a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| This is not an easy thing, Councilman Holquist, to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| But, honestly, I do not believe that more time is going to make this any clearer to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| And, personally, I have to vote my conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| I think we were called upon to do that by one of the speakers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| And I have to vote what I consider to be what this community, what is best for this community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4577)|
| 1:16:26| And I do believe that those of you who speak so passionately about the gun permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| and who appreciate that right in your own personal life are very responsible people who are well-intentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4594)|
| 1:16:43| But I look back over my life experiences with four children and now 14 grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| and, you know, I have to think about what I think is best as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| And I have to concur with a number of things that have been well stated tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| about why some of my fellow councilmen have determined that I cannot see how more guns make this a safer society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4623)|
| 1:17:15| I just cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| And I just think if we approach every situation with some form of some way of countering it that brings on violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4637)|
| 1:17:28| I think it just that is the first thing that we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| And I appreciate the comments that Mr. Dutton made tonight, and I think he feels that I'm a very irresponsible person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| But I didn't care to give fertilizer and fodder to those emails which came to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4661)|
| 1:17:52| by giving them the respect of passing me along to anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| Because I have to hope that the spirit in which those emails were written was a true passion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| and not from someone who would actually be a threat to me or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| So in my personal consideration and conscience, I determined it was best, as I told the reporter who I talked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4691)|
| 1:18:20| to just let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| That may not have been your choice or your decision, but it was what I came to peace with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| So I've come to peace with how I want to come down on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| And, frankly, it's like I tell my family sometimes, I'm ready to be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| First of all, I'd like to thank my colleagues and their patience with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| We requested a workshop not once but twice, and both times this body was willing to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| And I think that all of us will agree that we've had an opportunity for some incredible civic discourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| No matter which side of the issue you sit on, folks are very passionate about this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| and it's been rewarding to see our citizenry really engage in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| So thank you for allowing that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| I think all of us also have been educated a great deal on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| I, for one, met with Mr. James Wagner and went up to the gun safety facility on Rifle Range Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4760)|
| 1:19:27| and learned a great deal about the process to apply for and receive a gun carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| and what those responsibilities entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| And I don't think any of us around this table think that in any way the gun permit holders in this community are irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4777)|
| 1:19:48| By far the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Everyone that I corresponded with and everyone that I met with personally impressed me with their personal level of integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| and their commitment to following both the spirit and the letter of the law in terms of being a permit carry holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4797)|
| 1:20:06| I think for me, probably as a school teacher, it really came down to my difficulty with reconciling the convergence of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4806)|
| 1:20:20| and our greenways with our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| We don't allow guns in situations in our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| We tragically have had an incident here on our very own community where we can see how that can become a terrible, terrible problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4827)|
| 1:20:38| And enough of our schools use our city parks for ball fields on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| Not every school has their own softball field or baseball field or soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| And enough of our greenways cross over school property that if enforcement of this ordinance as it currently stands is not difficult enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4850)|
| 1:21:00| I think adding that to the mix would make it even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| So I plan to not support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| Just to restate, because I realize that by reading where the votes go in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| and what council members are saying that I probably will not be able to accomplish what I'd like to accomplish by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| But I am going to vote for this on first reading simply because I am not happy with where the dialogue has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4884)|
| 1:21:32| and how that process has occurred to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I realize, again, that it probably won't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| There probably won't be a second reading on this ordinance, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| I certainly defer to the majority of my colleagues on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| And if it did go to a second reading, there's a good chance that I would vote no on the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| but I will vote yes on the first reading simply on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| I'm not satisfied that the dialogue has been what it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| I want to thank everyone for a great discussion, both the people who spoke from the audience and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| The Second Amendment, like the First Amendment and the rest of the Constitution, is the law of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| And I guess, Councilman Booker, if I might disagree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| I think what the Supreme Court said is it's not just a reference to state militias and their recent ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| It is an individual right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| So I think the other thing that I struggle with all through this is what a lot of you all reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| If a carry permit holder can legally walk down Gay Street or Market Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| and all of a sudden cuts through Crouch Park Extension, now they're in violation of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| just something feels not right about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| That being said, I understand the concern about guns in parks, with playgrounds and ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| You know, one of the differences in local government and other forms of government is we have to deal with implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| We don't get to do government at 30,000 feet and say, here's the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| We have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| So for us, this isn't really somebody said, well, how did it get to be, I guess Joe said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| how did it get to be guns in parks and guns in bars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| For us, it really becomes more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| It becomes, you know, guns at little league fields and guns at parks used by Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| And we all looked at, like, I think in the workshop we talked about, well, can you separate those out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| where it's legal in some and not legal in others, and Greenway's legal in some and not legal in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| And we started playing all through that, and we even made lists, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| Somebody asked, well, can the administration make a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| So we made lists saying, you know, parks used by Knox County schools and the ones with ball fields, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| And then we started talking about how, and then the Greenways, which ones intersected with schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| and didn't, and we realized that gets to be an incredibly difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| But that's what local government does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| I mean, we have to deal with implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| We don't just get to deal with theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| It's what makes our job both great, because we can make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| but hard because it's about real life things on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| I'm afraid if we monkey with the situation we have right now with the existing ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| we could end up in a situation where you have criminal penalties in some parks and no penalties in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| Because I think once you amend the existing ordinance, it loses its grandfather status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| and then you go back to, well, if you're going to have them in some and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| then you go to a situation where criminal penalties are in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| And I think it's important that criminal liabilities are removed from all of our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| I think the best course of action is kind of where I think what I hear as a council going is to keep the city ordinance we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| and to take no further action to reinstate criminal penalties under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| If we do that, Knox will be the only large city in Tennessee to have eliminated the application of criminal sanctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| to those legal permit holders who carry in our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Ms. Mitchell, if you'd call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Okay, I heard three ayes and six noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| All right, so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| 12B is an ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 05-1592,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| entitled, An Ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| to Create a Central Business Improvement District for the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and to Appoint a Corporation to Act as an Advisory Board to the District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| with the Necessary Powers and Authority to Carry Out the Purposes and Intent of the District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| so as to Add a Member of the City Council to Serve as an Ex Officio Member of the Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| of the Central Business Improvement District Management Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| and as a Liaison between the Board and the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Requested by Councilmember Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| Yeah, I think by and large there's nothing wrong with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| I'm sort of concerned as a person currently who would be responsible for finding somebody to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| I kind of, before I vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| I want to make sure that there's several people around this table who want to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| because it's real easy to say this is a great idea and let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| And so I'm hoping at least several people will say, yes, I would love to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| and go to all the meetings and sit through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Well, Councilman Becker, if I plan to be with you much longer, I would just love to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5177)|
| 1:26:26| Now, how's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| We had a tiny little discussion, just a brief one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| I had somehow understood that this might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| And so when I met this week with Michelle and Michael from the CBID, we talked about it a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5200)|
| 1:26:53| And I would like to hear, if they would be willing to, they're with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| comment on their position on this, if that would be all right with the rest of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| Patrick, if you'd give us your name and address and title as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| My name is Patrick Hunt, 1111 Luttrell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| And I called you Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| No, it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| I'm very sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| That's okay, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Thank you to you and the other Councilmembers that we met with over the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| We really appreciate that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| I am Chairman of the Board of the Central Business Improvement District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| effective July 1 of this year, for a one-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| It so happens that we have a Board meeting on Monday at 1130, which are open meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| and all of you are invited to attend not only that meeting but every single one that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| And we'll be certain to put this on our agenda so that we can hear from our full Board on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| We have not had that opportunity yet, and so we intend to have that discussion on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Anything else, Ms. Pila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| No, not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Councilman Holquist, and then I'll work my way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| Okay, well, I put this on the agenda because I feel like the CBID is probably going to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5278)|
| 1:28:05| and increase its role in our city over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| When we went as the group with the Transportation Mobility Committee went to Charlotte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| we visited with one of the groups there called Center City Partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| which is the equivalent of CBID, although it's much larger, partly because Charlotte's a larger city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5297)|
| 1:28:24| but also because they've set up multiple improvement districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| I think they have five now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| And so as a result of that and the size of the city, they have a larger staff, a much bigger budget, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5310)|
| 1:28:41| And I think that we may be moving in that direction, and I feel like it will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| Again, this council position would be ex-ficio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| They would not be voting, but it would be helpful to have that more direct connection with the CBID board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| And I think it will be good for the CBID because it will be more instructive to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| It will have a better feel for what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| If you have a council member that's designated, they're much more likely to show up at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| And going back to Vice Mayor Becker's question about who's going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| I think the intent is for that election to take place when the other elections for vice mayor, the KTA board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5357)|
| 1:29:26| the beer board chair occur after the swearing in every two years of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5366)|
| 1:29:33| And so your question could only be answered in part by the people that are here because there are five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5373)|
| 1:29:42| The majority of the people here now would not be serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| and would not be eligible to be elected to that position come the swearing in in late December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| So I would hope that someone would agree to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| I would think that they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Councilman Pelo indicated she'd be willing to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| but she would not be eligible since she wouldn't be on council then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I guess what's the importance of doing it now versus waiting until those people are sitting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| that might have that opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| You're asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| They would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| I guess you could have us, Mr. Swanson, I want to respond to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| I guess if they were to decide that they wanted to have that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| they wouldn't be able to hold that election at the same time the other vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| et cetera, et cetera, elections are held at that first council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| And that would have to be something that's elected, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Instead of just being appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| Well, I missed the first part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| Could you reiterate what the issue is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| Councilman Hall, do you want to restate your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| I guess my question is what is it, in what sense there's five of us that can't serve in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| What is the purpose of bringing this up now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| Why not let, wait until January or whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| and let them decide if they want to add this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Well, and my question to Ms. Swanson is if the election is supposed to be held when the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| and billboard chair and KTA representative are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| I don't even know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| By council, then would we have to have a special provision for the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| The way it's drafted right now, the answer to your question is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| It's conceivable that it could be, if you decided not to proceed with it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| I'd just put it in there to select it at the same time you select a vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| because it seemed like a convenient time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| That could be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Table it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Let's table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| It could be changed so that you could pick a different time for selecting that person who would serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| Only initially, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| You'd want to, I think ideally you'd want to do the elections from there on at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| But you could draft it in such a way that that could be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| For the first election you could do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| So it's possible to accomplish it the way you initially suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| It's possible to accomplish it the way Mr. Hall brings it up, just whichever way council wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Some of it, one or the other, would require a little bit of redrafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| But I could probably do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Well, the reason for my making the comment that I did that I would be interested is because I would not attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| I'd be interested in being elected to that so that I would be sure that I did not intrude on their meetings and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| I just personally don't see the point in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| After the discussion that we had, I frankly do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| And I think anything that this council can glean from the CBID and needs to be involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| I think we can easily ask them to come and report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| They were certainly willing to spend the time with us when Ms. Roddy made the request at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| And I just, that was a rather facetious comment on my part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| because I'd be glad to be chosen so that I could make sure that I didn't intrude on their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5591)|
| 1:33:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| I thought you were being serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| I wasn't being serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| I guess I would like to respond to something that Vice Mayor Becker brought up earlier in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| and that was the conversations that he announced that he intends to have with other members of council regarding our transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| And I think that that's relevant in this debate in that council does already have a number of appointed positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5620)|
| 1:33:49| both those that are formally elected at the time of the Vice Mayor, like our representative to the Knoxville Tourism Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| and the, I'm sorry, the KTA, that's what I'm trying to say, KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| And the beer board chair and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| And then some that are more informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| We have a representative to the pension board, which Mrs. Pila has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| which may or may not be a council position as we sifted through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| But at any rate, I think if we're going to take on another liaison-type role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| I think as a body we need to be committed to the information sharing that makes that position valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| And I'll take as much blame as anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| The two positions that I have taken on that I feel like are liaison roles are with the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| and with Legacy Park Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| And I try to bring initiatives from the Metropolitan Drug Commission to beer board frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| Vice Mayor Becker has to help me out, as he did tonight, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| to remind me that they were available to hand out buttons and materials and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| But going forward, whether it's at council dinner or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| I think this idea of a liaison is only productive if there's some kind of formalized way to do that information sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5697)|
| 1:35:08| You know, I'd love to learn more about whatever committees, you know, the pension board or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| But Mrs. Pila needs to have the opportunity to share that information about the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| You know, where we're reminded quarterly or whatever, let's learn more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| And then it's productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| But if not, it's really kind of a formality that's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Councilman Hoppus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Well, Councilman Roddy, in response to that, I guess one of the things that I would wonder about then is why we have a KTA representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5732)|
| 1:35:41| Is that happening in that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Is that what we're doing with KTA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5743)|
| 1:35:50| Are you satisfied that we're accomplishing what you said should be accomplished with the CDID with KTA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5750)|
| 1:35:59| I think what I tried to express, Councilmember Hulk, is that in all of the representations that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| I don't think we are currently taking full advantage of the information sharing that we could be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| that would be helpful in terms of my education as a councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| Then we can debate whether or not we should continue those others or not at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| I will say, and perhaps this is not going anywhere, and if so, then I'll be glad to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5783)|
| 1:36:30| And that could be brought up, perhaps, as Councilman Hall said, with the new city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| if they should deem that they want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I will say that there are ex officio positions on the CDID board for a state representative and a state senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5798)|
| 1:36:45| So I think it's very much in keeping with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| and there's a much more important relationship between the city government and CDID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| than there is on the state legislative level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| But if there's no second, then I'll just withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| I think there actually was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| No, it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Sorry, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Mr. Swanson, by council rules, if this is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| we can't bring it up if the new council that's elected wants to, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| If I change it a little bit, you can bring it back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| It's scary the power the man has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| We better call that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| Those are the worst ayes I've ever heard, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5873)|

| 1:37:56| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| I heard four ayes and five noes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| so you're left in the good hands of Mr. Swanson if he wants to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| That being the last item to come before us, no one has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090922?start=5888)|
