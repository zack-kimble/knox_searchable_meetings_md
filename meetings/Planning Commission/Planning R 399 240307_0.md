| 0:10:09| First item on the agenda is item number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=609)|
| 0:10:17| This is the consideration of the Knox County Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Staff recommendation is to approve Knox County Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| Director Brooks, would you like to comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| I think Mayor Jacobs is here and would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Mayor Jacobs, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you, Chairman Hill and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| I appreciate you all giving me the opportunity to speak here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| As you're aware, our general plan has not been updated in over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| And during that time, we've experienced significant growth and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| We embarked on our first Comprehensive Land Use and Master Transportation Plan during the fall of 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| and dubbed this process Advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Advanced Knox is an effort to define a vision and create a plan that will guide growth, land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| transportation, economic prosperity, and quality of life in the county for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| Knox County, working with our consultant, Kimberly Horn, engaged with over 4,000 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| to hear what they love most about their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| In other words, while this was a data-driven process, the vision and goals that we heard from the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| helped form the foundation for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| This is a unique opportunity to align our land use and transportation goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| and create a fiscally responsible blueprint that will help guide decisions about future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| and how infrastructure investment will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| The proposed plan is a comprehensive strategy to manage growth responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| and ensure a resilient future for generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| It aligns with our shared vision of a thriving community that balances economic progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| with the preservation of our rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| The goal here is to continue to make Knox County a place where you want to raise a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| where businesses want to locate, and bring jobs for you, your grandchildren, and obviously your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| Thank you to our neighbors who participated in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| and a big thank you to everyone who put in so much hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| in creating what I believe will be a massive positive benefit for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| I ask for your support and your approval of this plan. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| We have a list of folks here that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=769)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| I'm here representing the Knox County Planning Alliance and Advocates for Balanced Growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| I want to give a big thank you to the county for starting this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| This is kind of a second go after the growth plan was looked at in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| and thankfully it's a much better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Looked at a lot of data, a lot of really important public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| It was robust, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| There were a couple of priorities that were really brought out in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| One, of course, is what we hear every month, the need for more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| For that, I'm glad there's some really great progress in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| It has some new place types and some new types of development that can help us build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| in ways that we haven't really maybe thought of before in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| in terms of some mixed use and some town centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| That's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Those are located in the maps in places that are near to infrastructure that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| From a net fiscal impact, we're really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| There's also something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| It was really, I think, encapsulated in your workshop last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| The consultants gave you a pretty good list of some major concerns that were expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| One was a concern about approval of single-family residential developments in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| That was a significant area of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| One talked about really the impact of approval of growth on the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| and the children and our education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| The third was a desire of preserving more open space and limiting sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| I guess really speaking to that, one of the questions is, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| why is that a concern for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| I looked and I kind of understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| The community feels that often our processes and outcomes don't really hear their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| In the last five years, from 2019 to 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| this commission is particularly interested in the conversion of agricultural land to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| a very common request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| This commission has had, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Let's see, had, oh, well, I looked at five-acre or more parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| There are 18 requests for plan amendments to go from ag to a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| All 18 of those requests were approved, which indicates that the plan is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| while planning and public input set some as agricultural land use, the plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| it's been really easy to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| So that's a primary concern that the community had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So when you look at this plan today and you're discussing it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| I'd urge you to ask, you know, will it support sticking to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| You know, a lot of data was crunched to create the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| One of the things that was expressed as a primary objective was to increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| predictability of this process, not only for landowners and applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| but also the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| So I guess, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| the first question is take a good look at the criteria for amending the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| and do we have the right criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Are there ways to strengthen it to keep it more sticky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| The second one would be the transition plan, which is, that's Appendix H that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| So that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| is that going to be providing the dependability and predictability that people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| One question in particular I had is if an applicant requests a zoning amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| if an applicant requests a zoning that isn't in that appropriate or partially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| related for a place type, how is that handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| Is that something that you can consider, or is that something that is off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Finally, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| what's present in this plan to help address that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| those rural spaces and limiting sprawl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| The growth plan amendment that was just approved by county commission is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| through the adoption process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| That's in the rural areas, a two-acre unit limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| That is something that is still very developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| And looking at other counties in Tennessee and then outside of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| they often for growth sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| they've looked at reducing it to down to maybe one unit every two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Williamson County, when they did their general plan in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| they actually went to one unit every five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| So I'd just urge you to take a good look at that as you're debating this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| We have Mr. Charlie Debevois, or is that Debevois?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| How do I pronounce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Everyone flubs it, so don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1070)|
| 0:17:59| I'm Charlie Debevois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| I live in Sequoia Hills, but I bought a farm on Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| And I've been working with Kevin and a bunch of others in addressing the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| of sprawl and how it's been addressed in the advanced NOx growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| And what I've seen is a desire to limit sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1105)|
| 0:18:34| at least an expressed desire to limit sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| but a lack of follow-through, that we still, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| are unable to zone a town center in the county area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| And so that's something that I would urge you guys to change because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| that that is an effective use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| and it's been super popular in the North Shore Town Center is a perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| So I think that two homes per acre is plenty in the growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1144)|
| 0:19:13| and as Kevin just said, one per two acres is preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| So thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Mr. Wolf Negley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1167)|
| 0:19:36| I'm speaking on behalf of the Foundation for Global Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| Mr. Negley, could you give your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Yeah, Wolf Negley, 4425 Balraj Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| On behalf of the Foundation for Global Sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| we acknowledge this proposed plan includes substantial improvements over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Yet it still fails to consider many of the most pressing issues that threaten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| property values, well-being, and even life of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| The planning scenarios make good on many plan ET concepts with a bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| window dressing for the place types the plan introduces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| However, the plan is based on narrow-minded projections of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| patterns without the use of policy simulation to determine what the impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| would be when emerging development patterns take different turns in the face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| of changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Today, it's not an idle question if an atmospheric river could be headed our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| We must get prepared for such contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Today, it's not an idle question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Natural resources are considered in the plan only in terms of their natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1253)|
| 0:21:00| beauty, not for their ecological functions, inherent values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| and hidden vulnerabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Oak Ridge National Laboratory is mentioned as an employer only in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| Why not for their urban climate adaptation research and expert advice on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| transformational adaptation and climate-resilient development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| Why not even for their prototype studies on climate-induced social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| vulnerability indexes for urban areas, which they prototyped in the 16 counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| of the East Tennessee Development District with direct involvement by Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| And why not even for their spatially explicit land, energy, water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| future scenarios for cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Those scenarios guide infrastructure transitions for urban sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| Knoxville and Atlanta served as the principal study areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| and it's not even mentioned in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Public services are addressed mostly in terms of infrastructure development need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| rather than its proper sequencing and cost optimization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| Climate change, actually, is not mentioned at all in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| But because of it and its related global polycrisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| land use patterns will greatly influence the cost of public services in the future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| This is particularly true with regard to risks such as flooding, landslides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| wildfires, sinkholes, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| This plan, promoted as a data-driven process, is not common sense driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| No coherent discussion is in the plan about how assumptions may bias the model results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| We ask you to send the plan back for completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| Ms. Amy Nolan, is Ms. Nolan here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| She's coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Director Snowden, will you want to speak on this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| Not necessarily unless questions arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I'm Amy Nolan with Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| As per state law, the Knoxville Chamber was represented on the Growth Policy Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and voted to approve Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs' proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| The Chamber recognizes that current guidelines developed more than 20 years ago have led,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| in many cases, to the subdivisions that consume green space without the proper roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| and commercial hubs to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| We've heard time and time again throughout this process that, quote, the secret is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Everyone is coming to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| We've also heard we don't want to be like Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| To paraphrase my boss, Nashville is a Ferrari going 120 miles per hour in the left lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| and we're a Buick in the right lane going about under the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Here's what the data says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Knoxville's population is growing, but the largest portion of that growth are those older than 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1465)|
| 0:24:33| and the second largest portion are those between 0 and 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Most of that is attributable to the spike in enrollment at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Growth among those ages 24 to 55, a key indicator of economic health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| ranks at the bottom three among 10 peer cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| This is a demographic who we rely on to fill jobs, grow companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| serve as a tax base, and the philanthropic support for all the amenities we enjoy as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| Tonight the Chamber is going to celebrate its annual Pinnacle Awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| and I promise you if we ask every single award winner what their number one challenge was in growing their organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| they will tell you that it's talent and workforce, retaining and recruiting employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| The Chamber's endorsement of the Gross Policy Amendment admittedly was a gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| Our investors do have reservations that the planned growth areas don't extend far enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| and the rollback to just two units per acre in the rural areas is impractical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| That was tempered, however, with the promise of a variety of place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| in the planned growth area that is currently not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Those include more multimodal communities with access to commercial amenities that young professionals prefer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| housing for seniors, which I've changed that to empty nesters who are now trapped in large homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| because they are unavailable to find alternatives in their own community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| and housing that is attainable via price for any family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Let me also be clear, agriculture is not an economic engine for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Agriculture employment represents less than 1% of employment in the Knoxville MSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| You'll hear talk about a study probably, a UT study, that attempts to quantify agricultural impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| The mythology of that study includes things like Bush Brothers, corporate headquarters where no food is produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| custom foods, which makes packaged foods for restaurants no locals use, restaurants, Clayton Homes, which uses woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1608)|
| 0:26:57| So please do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So throughout this long process, this public has made its priorities clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| They want to create more housing and preserve green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| This plan strikes that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| The chamber also recognized that keeping the status quo is estimated to result in an annual $2 million deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| as infrastructure struggles to keep up with sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| That's a burden on taxpayers who already earn less than their counterparts in similar-sized cities in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| This new plan aligns infrastructure with potential growth areas, which save the county nearly $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1660)|
| 0:27:50| That's money that can be used to invest in education, infrastructure, parks, and other amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| Planning and Knox County staff have literally put thousands of hours in developing a plan that doesn't please everyone entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| but does put the county on the right trajectory to drive economic prosperity while preserving the quality of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1693)|

| 0:28:28| Hanson Sale, 609 Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I am here on behalf of East Tennessee Realtors to speak in support of the proposed comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| When we're making these decisions, I think it's important to start out with the data about the ongoing housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| As you all know, housing costs have vastly outpaced incomes over the past five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| creating the worst affordability crisis since the 1980s when mortgage rates hit 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1726)|
| 0:28:53| In 2023, families needed an annual income of just over $94,000 in order to afford the medium-priced home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| That's compared to the median household income in Knox County of $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| As a result, two in three residents in our county cannot afford to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| This is a crisis that touches the lives of our friends, our neighbors, and many of our city's most essential workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| the people who keep our communities safe, who teach our kids, who respond to our medical emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| And the data bears this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| The starting salary for a sheriff's deputy in Knox County is enough to afford just 2% of the homes available on the market on any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1768)|
| 0:29:37| So I submit to you what happens when our police officers cannot afford to live in the city in which they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| The starting salary for a teacher in Knox County schools is, again, enough to afford 2% of homes listed in any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1784)|
| 0:29:54| And so what happens when we do not have enough teachers to teach our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| The median salary for a registered nurse is enough to afford just 5% of homes on the market on any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| And over the last few years, I think many of us have experienced firsthand what happens when the emergency room or the hospital is understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1806)|
| 0:30:15| It is these type of people who are hurt the most when we fail to plan for growth and continue to rely on plans and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1815)|
| 0:30:24| that reflect the needs and priorities of our county from 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| This plan proposed today is a healthy compromise that will promote responsible growth and bring our planning process into the modern era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1829)|
| 0:30:38| It will work to preserve our county's rural landscape and natural beauty by reducing density in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| And yes, this will be the first and the last time I ever stand before you advocating for reducing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| It will also help to address our growing housing needs by legalizing new types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| and expanding development potential in areas that are well served by existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| Some may say that we've put too much density in areas without infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| but I will say the areas where we're putting density were identified through a rigorous planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| that included eight different utility districts, including KUB, TVA, Knox County Schools, and other local subject matter experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| It's also important to remember that this proposal didn't just come out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| It is the direct result of a rigorous two-year public planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| that included engagement with thousands of city and county residents and other stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| And I think it's also important to remember, the people who are asking you to reject this plan, what are they actually saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| They are saying, in effect, that the 20-year-old plan that we have now is sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| Rejecting this plan would be the equivalent to maintaining the status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| a status quo that all of you know is not something that anyone is satisfied with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| and will continue to spur the sprawl-style growth that this plan is designed to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1920)|
| 0:32:08| Is this plan perfect? Of course not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| As you all know, is anything ever perfect in public decision-making and in public life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| So no, it's not perfect, but it's undeniably better than what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| For these reasons, our association asks that you vote to approve this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| and move forward to provide housing for the people who need it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| I thought about asking Director Brooks to read the plan word for word, but I'm not going to punish her like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| I joined this commission in August of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| I think, Commissioner Adams, you came right before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| and one of the things that I've been consistent on is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| I've said it more frequently than in the last couple of years, is we need an updated growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| I think what you heard today is everybody's not going to be happy with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| This is probably the best plan that we can come up with to update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| But think back over 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Where were you at in life 20 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| For me, I'll just tell you, I was getting ready to get married, wasn't married yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| didn't have any kids, and had just finished college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| That is a long time ago that we're still operating on a plan that is not adequate for where Knox County is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| So not to cut off debate or anything like that, but just because I have been begging for this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Mr. Chairman, I would like to make the motion that we approve the advanced Knox plan as recommended before us in the packet today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Browning to approve the plan as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| And we have more discussion here. Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| Oh, oh, oh, Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair. My light hadn't worked for months, so that's probably a reason why you're confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2057)|
| 0:34:27| We have had over the last couple of months a little bit of a not a debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| but some questions about the criteria for a plan update or change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And I know staff included quarterly opportunities to do that instead of annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| I'd like to look at that criteria again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| I think we discussed it briefly at a general review on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| The current criteria for the plan includes one of several bullet points of things that would allow for a plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2096)|
| 0:35:11| I think that that's the way it is currently. In proposed, it says two or more of the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| Because it's so comprehensive and so detailed and takes up so much acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| I think we probably ought to stick with the one instead of adding two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2122)|
| 0:35:31| On down in the criteria for the plan update, it talks about significant new utilities or state and federal road projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2131)|
| 0:35:42| Mr. Snowden is in the business of building roads just like the state and federal folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| So I think we probably ought to strike state and federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| It could be a private person that built the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| It could be in partnership with county. That happens a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| And then finally, under trends and projections, I think there ought to be a comma housing conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2165)|
| 0:36:19| that would be tied to what the definition of trends or projections might entail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| just to make sure that that is comprehensive enough to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| That's really one of the main reasons that we're here today is because of the lack of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| And that is all I have, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you, Vice Chair Uten. Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2201)|
| 0:36:48| Yeah, I'd like to echo Vice Chair Uten's concerns about the criteria for updating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| First off, I want to say, I mean, what a great job everybody's done from the mayor's office down through Kimberly Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| Two years is a long time to be working on any one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| And I think they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| I do think people joke and say, you know, compromises when everybody walks away unhappy, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| and that's kind of what's going on here other than it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| I believe it's worked well, you know, with the reduction of the density in the rural areas to two units an acre versus three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2238)|
| 0:37:26| It's a big step with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| But the reality of it is Knox County encompasses over 500 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| You know, if you do the math, it's actually 320,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| So as good as the plan is, you can't expect it to be hyper accurate and on point exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| Again, I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I think they've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| However, there are some areas in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| So that kind of brings me to, you know, currently our rules to change a sector plan today, it's just one meeting one criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2273)|
| 0:38:04| This one takes it to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| I'm not sure why we would want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| All of it has to come in front of this body and county commission and city council anyway, depending on what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| I mean, I really feel like we need to have the flexibility to change it, not necessarily to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| but we need the flexibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| And I think, you know, one requirement instead of the two, as Commissioner Rudin was pointing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| I think that's an important thing that we need to try to change and stay with the current way we're doing that particular part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| The rest of the plan I love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| I'd be on board with, again, Commissioner Rudin's other suggestions inside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| Again, you know, Mr. Snowden in Knox County does a great job with building a lot of big roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| I mean, the Schott Road extension is a good example, you know, but here in this wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| the Schott Road extension wouldn't change any opportunities for zoning or a reason to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| So I would be on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Let's go to Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| You know, I will echo a lot of what other people have said is, you know, this is not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| No plan is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| And I think that that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| And I think that it will, it's one of those things that once we, once it's a set in motion, set in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| it's not just left or as written, won't be just left in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| You know, we'll be continuously adding on and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| The one thing that I will say, and I don't know if this is I'm kind of maybe more of a question for fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2391)|
| 0:40:02| who have made the suggestion to remove the two criteria instead of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| You know, one of the comments that we've heard is how just how overly easy it is to change some of these predetermined sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2409)|
| 0:40:26| and areas that we've set up in previous plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| And just that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| I think it's worth considering the fact that maybe right now what we do have is one criteria might make it a little bit too easy to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| changes that shouldn't otherwise be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| So I don't see really a problem with the two criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| But I'll just want to throw that out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| The one thing that I do think that we should, where I think that this is lacking and should be added on to today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2453)|
| 0:41:03| and hopefully we can make an amendment to include this if others agree, that is the hillside and hilltop protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2463)|
| 0:41:11| So in the city, those have written requirements for those areas on how to develop or not develop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2471)|
| 0:41:21| In the county, we have recommendations, but not requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| And I think that also to help with some of the concerns from community members who are worried about more rural areas getting developed and going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2486)|
| 0:41:44| I think that adding and allowing staff to get the exact wording of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| But I think that this plan should incorporate protections for the hillside and hilltop protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| So I hope that through discussion today, we can agree to add that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| And I'll turn it over to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins. Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| A question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| When we made the new rural conservation zone, not zone, place type, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2538)|
| 0:42:28| On the matrix, looking at the rural preservation zone, it is not any, it's not either directly related or partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2548)|
| 0:42:45| But I think it might be, unless there was a, I don't know, was that, I guess was that looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2565)|
| 0:42:56| It was looked at. Give me a moment. I'm going to look at the rural preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| It's not something that we've used very often in the county, that zone in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2581)|
| 0:43:11| I think that was an oversight. I think it should be partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Partially related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Okay. So I think we should fix that since it was just an oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| When it comes to some of the other things, such as the amendment criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| So, you know, one of the criteria for an amendment is the proposed changes support the policies, goals and objectives and criteria of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2612)|
| 0:43:45| I feel like that is a criteria, a checkbox that any proposed amendment to the plan ought to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2625)|
| 0:43:56| And really, as a result, means there's only one other reason you need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2636)|
| 0:44:05| So by saying you need two criteria to apply, one should always apply when we decide to change the plan, which is that it complies with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2645)|
| 0:44:16| So I don't think that that's so much of an issue that we need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I don't think that means we're really making it a harder barrier to change either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| It's just potentially giving Knoxville, Knox County Planning staff, the Commission, a little bit of leeway to say, well, let's make sure this fits with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2664)|
| 0:44:37| In effect, I still think it's essentially one criteria change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| Now, when it comes to the roads, I guess my question with Commissioner Ooten's intent to maybe include like local roads or some other types of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2681)|
| 0:44:57| I think that could make sense. I kind of wonder if that doesn't get taken care of as part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2697)|
| 0:45:06| If our plan is a transportation plan, we should have local transportation plans that are done in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2706)|
| 0:45:13| And so maybe there'd be a way to say, OK, when these roads are done in the transportation plan, that is sort of an automatic change in condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2713)|
| 0:45:24| So a potential change to your property isn't really changing the plan because we did what was in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| I'm not sure if I worded that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| And this plan has a set way to come back and look at it on a regular basis, a commitment to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2735)|
| 0:45:45| And in that sense, local infrastructure and road improvements ought to be continually added to this and made one of those types of conditions or things that makes an amendment comply with the plan or a potential amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2745)|
| 0:46:02| So I think there could be a way to fix that. Additionally, I guess I would like to hear from staff regarding hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2762)|
| 0:46:15| I had sort of understood that one of our place types kind of leaves that, it doesn't encompass it, but allows us to potentially codify that at a later date with that place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2775)|
| 0:46:32| I can speak to that. So the rural conservation place type that you mentioned just a minute ago, that is a place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| We utilize the hillside and ridgetop map, those layers to help inform the placement of that particular place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| And yes, I think you're correct. I think that that that place type could be used as a tool to think about the codification of the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2805)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| So Commissioner Schell, if you don't mind, could you clarify when we get back to this state, federal, local road, could you distinguish or differentiate how you would want to handle the local versus the state and federal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2819)|
| 0:47:15| I didn't quite understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| Let me look at this for a second and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Let's go to Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| Question first about process for the rural preservation and how that functions with hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2853)|
| 0:47:42| I wasn't quite tracking that exchange between Director Brooks and Shelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2862)|
| 0:47:53| The question, I think, and you correct me if I mistake you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| The question is, is the rural conservation place type an opportunity to further codify or take into consideration those concerns that were brought up as part of the hillside and ridgetop plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2878)|
| 0:48:14| Like that we need to stay off of the steep slopes, concentrate development in the areas that are more, they're flat, easier to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| I'm just trying to understand how that would be different from actually codifying in the same way that the city has the hillside protection in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2901)|
| 0:48:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| I look at it as this plan is approved by bodies, but it's not in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| We take this plan and then we build code according to our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So adding things that should be codified into the plan is not necessarily appropriate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2929)|
| 0:48:58| When the place type allows, if we say, okay, well, let's look at codifying it, these are the place types we've already identified where it fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| We have hillside protection in place types that are not, wouldn't be the rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| Like it wouldn't be zoned that per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| It would have this element on the property or the parcel, and we would need to be able to address that with some mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| And the hillside protection that the city has allows that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| So the rural conservation place, yeah, so hillside and ridgetop is not limited to places that are proposed to be designated as rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2967)|
| 0:49:38| In the city, the plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| It actually wasn't codified until the city zoning ordinance was updated in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| So in the county, it is just an advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| In terms of process, if you all wanted to make a recommendation, it would be, you would recommend the county commission consider adopting the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=2989)|
| 0:50:00| And then at that time, it would be folded into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| That's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Can you also, and this may be for Commissioner Hill or Council Blakeney, but the process, since we have a motion on the floor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3005)|
| 0:50:16| if we want to include a request for a county commission to do that regarding the hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| is that simply a request to the persons who have made the, yes, to amend that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| That was all the stuff I needed to address that had happened since I turned on my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| Since Commissioner Smith invoked when I joined planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| I will say that when I did and I sat with Director Green and I had all of the many plans that we are asked to read prior to joining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3043)|
| 0:50:58| I noticed that at the bottom of almost every single one of them, it was that they were out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| And that this particular one was extremely out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| And when I asked him, well, how do we deal with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| His answer was, we just kind of muddle through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Because he had no vision of it being updated at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| And so I'm very happy that it has made it this far and that we're looking at progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| Because this relates to Commissioner Uten and his request to have some greater flexibility in the amendments to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3087)|
| 0:51:40| During the last year or two years, when this body sat with the consultants who helped put this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| they talked about many of the benefits that this plan would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| And it would mean that this body, the planning commission, would no longer be seeing plan amendments every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3111)|
| 0:52:00| Back to when I joined, that's the context that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| We've always seen plan amendments every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| That was normal for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| So to hear this consultant say, this plan will take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| You won't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| A light bulb went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| And I asked that consultant, how frequently should we be seeing plan amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| And they said, once or twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| That is important in relation to the conversation that the commission is having right now regarding criteria for updating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| So the plan in front of us says that we should have two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| And I appreciate Commissioner Scheltzer's comment about one of those is kind of a de facto that should always be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| And that the others are really the more strident component that a development or a proposal needs to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| So I absolutely agree we need to have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| And I understand that from our workshop, there has been the adjustment to the plan that we would have a quarterly opportunity for plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3177)|
| 0:53:06| I think that is a more than reasonable compromise to what the consultants told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| that if we make this kind of holistic upgrade to our plan, we as the planning commission should only be seeing amendments once or twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| So for that reason, I support the two criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| I also support the hillside request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| I think that's something that we run into as planning commissioners with frequency where we see it's a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| but it's not something that a county plan has to follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| So I do want to encourage county commission to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3222)|
| 0:53:54| The only other item that I wanted to address, and this actually came in from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| along with they said thank you for updating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| This is the Knott's Heritage, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| But they asked about the historic conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| This is Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| And they called my attention to the fact that in that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| the items are all very positive in terms of making sure that we're listing historic locations on the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3262)|
| 0:54:31| We're making it easier for people to understand the history of their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| But there's nothing really in there that says we're going to try and protect the development around those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| And that is the request that they were making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| So this is something else that I would encourage, and I think it, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| would be handled the same way is that we would ask for county commission to look at this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| But it is a specific request that I need to be able to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| and I can't use my mic and read my computer at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| But I will, as this circles back around, read that specific item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| It is in everyone's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| But it is giving a little more toothiness to what that historic preservation can mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| and giving more tools to those historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Why don't we let Director Brooks read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| These mics, they pick up pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| This is the request that was sent from Knott's Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| We respectfully ask that you consider adding the following additional action to support policy number eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| conserve historic and cultural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Research and propose incentives and development standards that encourage new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| to have a design compatible with historical resources that are adjacent or in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3347)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| The one item I would add, and I brought it up at our commission education meeting on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| was to I'm very appreciative for evaluating where parks can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| and preserving historical locations, everything in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| all of the meeting with contingencies, trail systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| identifying where structure should be added, transportation, streets, the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3386)|
| 0:56:37| And the one item I would recommend being included as we are looking at a growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| and considering future needs is a current need, and that would be schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| I think that it would be valuable to evaluate locations as part of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| or just partner with the appropriate resources in our community to look for ways to enhance the success of this growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3416)|
| 0:57:06| to build these nodules of communities and how better to do that than with schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| and to perhaps decrease the population or overpopulation that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| and just to make that a part of the consideration as we move forward with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3440)|
| 0:57:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Yeah, just one more thing that I noticed that we discussed this at our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| and I think that part of the request was changed, but part of it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| On pages 33, 34, and 35, the place types suburban residential, suburban mixed-use residential, and corridor commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3470)|
| 0:58:00| On all three of those for the transportation, a secondary mode, it says NA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| But if you look at the example photos of all three of those, you may notice that there are sidewalks in all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| I think that to not say, even if we're saying secondary is walk-bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| I think that that would be an appropriate continuation of the previous sections where walk-bike is the primary and automobile is the secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3503)|
| 0:58:34| But I think that to leave off, considerate, and I know that this may be a little unconsequential overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3514)|
| 0:58:43| but I do think that if we're setting up these place types of how to think about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| we should certainly be saying that walk and bike are modes of transportation in those, even if it's secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3528)|
| 0:58:58| As we're developing areas, the conversation of walkability and connectivity gets brought up a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| and if you wanted to avoid making something more pedestrian-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3545)|
| 0:59:14| you could just point to this and say, well, it only says automobile and NA for secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| So I think that those three should have walk-bike as their secondary modes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| Commissioner, can I get a clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Suburban, mixed residential, corridor, commercial, and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| Suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| I think everybody is on board, I think, with the whole plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| and it seems like there's a lot of little things that people are putting on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| which overall don't have a problem with, with the exception of hillside and ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| I think if any of you were around years and years and years ago when this was first starting to be deliberated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| Tony Norman brought it up when he was on the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| and there was just a tremendous, tremendous amount of discussion and heartache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| and a lot of issues came along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| It's my understanding that that is going to be reviewed at some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| I do not think today is that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| It's too big and too broad of a subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Just saying, hey, we're going to adopt the city's hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| and ridgetop protection plan is a really bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| I would say it would have a good chance of not passing today, the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| not passing with that amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Everything else I think we can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| But the hillside, there's 100 square miles in the city, and most of it is built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| The majority of it is built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| There's 500 square miles in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| There are slopes, and most developers I know, you get to a point where it's not feasible to develop on the steep stuff anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3666)|
| 1:01:14| They tend to try to stay away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| It just gets too cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| But to come in at this stage for us to tell them, I mean, it's almost like a condemnation of those slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| and not allowing them to at least consider it, working around it and working with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| We all want it to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| I certainly have a concern with something that's had so much history in the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| to just pass on a quick amendment to the big plan, the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3704)|
| 1:01:53| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| I want to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| The hillside and ridgetop protection plan was already adopted by Knox County Commission on January 23, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| But it was adopted to be advisory in nature versus the city who adopted it and enforced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3724)|
| 1:02:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Now, if it comes through the plan and it is very clearly stated that it is advisory, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3734)|
| 1:02:22| But what I'm hearing is there's some discussion of it not being advisory, which that would be, I think, a big issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3742)|
| 1:02:31| a real big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| I just wanted to make sure everybody understood there's a tremendous amount of history behind that, that one little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| And those of us who've been in the construction and development world for 25 years remember it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| My point is it's, I think, a discussion for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| It's okay to have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| I just think it's really for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| Director Brooks, would you like to comment to Commissioner Boyer's request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| Yes, Commissioner Boyer, in response to those suggestions that came up during the workshop, we did add a couple items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| And I'm sorry, it took me a minute to just locate exactly where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| But they're on page 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| And so they are policies, they're action items associated with 9.1 and 9.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| 9.1 was adding Knox County schools to regular meetings that we have specifically related to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| And then 9.8, establish annual coordination meeting, meet annually with Knox County schools, leadership team, planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| and the county to discuss development trends, school district needs, Knox County schools, and Knox County capital plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| and any forecasted growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| So that was trying to capture what you had brought up during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| I'm not sure if that exactly captures what you were going for, but I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| And I was looking for, I think that's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| I think it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Just definitely would like to have that at the table and appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, Commissioner, Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Ms. Hillman, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Back to hillside discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| I think that if our body recommends as part of an approval of this plan that county commission consider the hillside codification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3863)|
| 1:04:37| that is not a demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| That is a request that the county commission consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| And I think it is a mechanism that this body has to keep that conversation moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| as opposed to it being stuck in the eddy that it is now, which is advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| So the staff does all of the work to show us what the potentials are of a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3897)|
| 1:05:06| and then that doesn't necessarily move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| I can't speak to the percentages of how often it doesn't or does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| but I know that frequently in the conversations we have here, it is quickly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| well, that's just advisory, that we don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| So this body has the ability to at least move that conversation forward by simply requesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| It is not a demand that it be part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| And I think as a commissioner that looks at the whole plan and looks at the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3934)|
| 1:05:42| that's what we're talking about is land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| that it's important for us to keep those parts of the conversation alive so that we can keep making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| So that's why I would still want to have that as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Who seconded the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Mr. Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| So I'm going to do some proposed friendly amendments for you guys to sign off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| The first one being for the criteria for a plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| just adding the word local before state and federal, so local slash state slash federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| Well, I was going to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| Here's why I don't think it's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| and I want to go to Director Snowden to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| This is already our local plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| And this local plan assumes all of the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| What this is seeking to state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| and give criteria around are things outside of our local control that might be put on that we don't know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| which is why it's got federal and state, not necessarily local, as defined in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| And that's kind of what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| I'd like to let us go to Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| I want to get some clarification from his point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| Yeah, I don't know if I would interpret it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| Literally, I think if we were to allow, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| Coward Mill comes to mind, a road that kind of really, you know, was developed fairly quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| and then Shawd Road that Commissioner Huber mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| I think if the thought process was to include new roadways, that we should include the local terminology here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| just to make sure that those roads that we build that may not necessarily be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| ones that, you know, were within the five-year capital plan, that they would be codified with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| So in that situation, based on the concern I'm hearing, I would recommend that the local road be added personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4057)|
| 1:07:47| So then I'll accept that friendly amendment to add the local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| but I wanted to make sure we got that from Director Snowden first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Add local under the utilities provision of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| Under the utilities provision of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Okay, so we're going to add local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Local slash state slash federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| And Mr. Browning agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| I will agree, Commissioner Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| One for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| The second potential friendly amendment would be to, as Commissioner Higgins pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4098)|
| 1:08:26| add secondary modes for suburban residential, suburban mixed residential, and corridor commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4106)|
| 1:08:36| And those secondary modes being walk, comma, bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4116)|
| 1:08:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Sorry, I had a question, and I missed the first part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| So can you read that, say that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| So for the, there's a primary mode and a secondary mode on all of these place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| and perhaps Mr. Higgins has it pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Replacing N.A. for those three categories, suburban residential, suburban mixed residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| and corridor commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Instead of N.A., it have walk, bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4152)|
| 1:09:25| Just because they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4165)|
| 1:09:42| So, Mr. Chairman, this is more of a question, I guess, for our attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| This is where I start getting nervous is when we start doing amendments without it having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| gone through the full vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Not opposed to what Commissioner Scelso had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| I just don't understand all of the additional ramifications, the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4197)|
| 1:10:02| that that might have on these things that we're not thinking about this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| And it looks like Director Snowden wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| So that might be, or someone from the county would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| Mandy Benedict, Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| I'm not sure that we need to add that as an amendment, because if you turn to page 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| I think we can add that in anyways, because on page 42, it goes into detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| What the modes of transportation are for suburban and mixed use place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| and it spells it out right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| So I don't think we need to add that as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| I think that we can just correct that in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| So you're saying that it should be corrected on those pages because it's already stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| elsewhere in the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| It's stated on page 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| I'll read that just so everyone's on the same page here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| In the suburban place types for the primary transportation mode is automobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| and secondary mode is walk, bike, or transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| So it speaks to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| But it's listed as NA for secondary type on those place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| I think that we can make that edit, as Ms. Benedict said, based on page 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| She was saying it needs to be edited regardless, not necessarily as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| It's just a typo earlier on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Those are all of my potential amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| The oversight for rural conservation having rural preservation as a partially related zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4298)|
| 1:11:54| I forget we have to use these now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| The rural preservation zone has a minimum lot size of 15 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| so it doesn't align with the conservation place types clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| So just bringing that up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| I know we hadn't really looked at that too deeply whenever we made that comment initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| earlier on in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| I think it could still be partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Unincluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4340)|
| 1:12:29| Can I think on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| You're waiting on the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Let me think on that one a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| I know Commissioner Midas has been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Because, again, anything we do, I go back to what are the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| And if we're talking 15, I'd just love to know the interplay a little bit more before accepting that friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| yay or nay, just because I want to know the interplay a little bit better so we don't shoot ourselves in the foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| We'll give you time to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Midas, let's hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| In general, I'm very supportive of this plan, and I appreciate everyone's work and input into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| One of the things that I really appreciate about the plan is Appendix H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| which allows us to kind of incorporate the current zoning ordinance to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| I would like to see the zoning code, along with most of you, updated sometime in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| now that we have this momentum going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| And also it's the connection between transportation and future transportation plans to this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| One question that I have regarding criteria for changing the plan, I do agree that we need to stick with the two criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4418)|
| 1:13:47| But it does seem like these future near-term goals have already been included in this plan, comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4427)|
| 1:13:58| And I kind of wonder if we're going to use that as a criteria in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| Should that be criteria for changing the plan if we've already given that consideration in creating the plan to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| It does. Director Brooks, do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| I'm still looking at these different things that keep coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| I don't want to repeat your question. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Okay, so the near-term goals for transportation have been incorporated in creating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4467)|
| 1:14:36| So therefore, if someone was to come up with a change to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| based on some of these transportation goals that have already been considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| should that be criteria for changing the existing plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4486)|
| 1:14:59| I think that there are things that could come up that are unexpected in terms of changes to our transportation network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| I might ask Director Stone as well to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| When you look at the update, yes, we're going to evaluate this every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| and then we're going to do updates every five, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| But something could come up in a nearer term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| I don't know if I'm answering your question, what you're getting at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| But yes, I think that it should be kept in as a criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| Right now, we look at density or development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| More intense development should be around certain corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| If right now we're considering that there's going to be updates to Campbell Station Road at Fritz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| if we've included that and we've evaluated the density or the place type for that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| do we need to consider changing that in the next four years if this is already a big consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| and we've given that place type in lieu of these changes that's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4549)|
| 1:15:58| We've kind of worked on this backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| We're kind of using projected transportation goals for the future to kind of implement a plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4560)|
| 1:16:08| But I just don't want to go change it if we've already included that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| Director Stone, do you want to speak to some of the plans that the county has in terms of for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| There are some additional plans that are identified in here that are specifically related to transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| based on what we've heard and what we know in terms of population projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| There could be some transportation improvements that come out of those that would be changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Like page 46, the other transportation, other capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| are these projects, have they been included in evaluating the place types for the comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4598)|
| 1:16:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| They have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| So then if in a year from now someone comes up and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| well, we made these changes to Campbell Station Road and they want to change the place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| Then we're saying, well, it's already been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| Do we really need to change that based on that criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I would say it's already been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I guess I was thinking about areas for future study on page 48| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| when we've identified some additional areas for study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| But these for 46 and 47 have been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| And maybe I just want to say that we don't need to really be including this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| when it comes to criteria for changing the plan in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| Director Snowden, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| And it's a good question, Commissioner Meissner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| I think I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| I would say that, you know, especially on the maybe the midterm plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| you know, these are projects that we don't know fully develop the scope yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| So those scopes may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| And that would, you know, precipitate the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| or maybe create the need for that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| So, in addition, we've got a couple of other areas, you know, like the Rita community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| the Choteau Peninsula, as well as the South Knox and Straw Plains area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| that we're going to be doing some plans in that aren't codified here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| So I could think – I would say that especially some of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| even some of the near-term plans like – let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| Which one was I looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Some of the ones – even in Hardin Valley, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| we don't know fully the scope on those until we do a really robust traffic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| So I would think that there could be some changes to these plans that are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| even the existing plans we have today, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| They could be more intense depending on what road developments actually precipitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| Correct, ma'am. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| All right. Let's see here. Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| You all will never guess what I'm about to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| All right. So I want to continue this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| because I do think that it is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| And I think, to Commissioner Adams' point, it doesn't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| we're not in any way trying to lay out specific requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| We're saying we recommend that the county create and enforce actual requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4763)|
| 1:19:33| And I want to kind of compare to the city's adoption of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| And I don't necessarily think that it needs to be the same as the city's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| when it comes to hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| But I remember when that happened, and there was mention of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| back when the county was discussing this back in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| how it was a very tumultuous and complicated ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| When the city adopted it, I remember getting calls from clients worried that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| it was just the end of their property, their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| because there are properties that are completely in the hillside protection, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| And a lot of people were very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| I was concerned about some of my own properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| But the city's requirements don't prevent any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| It just controls, based off the percentages of slopes, how much you can disturb and remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4828)|
| 1:20:36| And I think if – Director Brooks, you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| but I think that changes from that come to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| So if somebody wants to deviate from those base requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| they can come to us and explain why they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| And I think that that is incredibly important to have those protections because it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| and to at least recommend this to the county because it's making a statement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| hey, we care about preserving and protecting the hillsides and the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4868)|
| 1:21:15| And it's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| I feel like I've heard more and more with development plans where people have been –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| the hillside protection has gotten mentioned, has gotten brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| and they've said, look, we don't even want to touch it anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| We don't want to develop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| It's not cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| And that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| There seems to be a lot of attitude towards, yeah, we're okay with not disturbing that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| So I think with that, adding extra protection there is not only wise on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4909)|
| 1:21:57| but also not detrimental to those who would otherwise have a need to develop in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| because there are still ways that you can disrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| and disturb those slopes if done in a very proper manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| So I don't want it to sound like we're saying by saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| we should add on a recommendation about hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| It is not to say we need to put a moratorium on disturbing areas within the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| It's saying we need to have more well-defined restrictions on building in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4953)|
| 1:22:43| and carving those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| And really, one thing that comes to mind for me is protecting –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| all this talk about how beautiful Knox County is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| and the beautiful parts aren't the parts that we've carved up and put buildings on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4974)|
| 1:23:02| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| It's the undisturbed areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| It's the places where there's trees and wildlife and fog in the mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| That's what is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| And the fears with this plan and the current plan is that if we don't better control development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=4995)|
| 1:23:27| we will lose that beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| We will end up without just unregulated destruction of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5009)|
| 1:23:37| I don't think that we will get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| and I think this plan is a really good step in the direction of further controlling and managing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| And that's why I think that it's so appropriate to include hillside protection in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| because this is what we're trying to accomplish bit by bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| And, again, not in the full extreme of, hey, let's write out some rules here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| but let's make a recommendation to address and codify some rules related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5043)|
| 1:24:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5053)|
| 1:24:22| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you, Chairman Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| And respectfully, Commissioner Higgins, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| I was just trying to think through also as an example of a development that I did probably in 2015 timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5070)|
| 1:24:41| Part of what the hillside does is it not only just says you can't get into the tree area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| but it reduces the density that you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| So we had about an 80-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| and we were able to successfully zone it to five units an acre over the entire parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| which comes out to about 400 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| So what we decided to do was consolidate all that down, which is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| That's really what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| So we went with planned residential and consolidated all that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| apartment complex and preserved probably 30, 40 acres around it in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| just stayed away from the slopes and did that down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| Now, if it were under the hillside, probably, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| it would have clipped a lot of that density out of there, and maybe we would have ended up with 200 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| Or we could have just gone through on single family and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| and taken all the trees out, but that wasn't our purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| My point is it'll eat into density as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| Yeah, and I'm not saying that we should include it to eat into density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| I don't think that it necessarily does that with the way the city is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| But I think that it's a great example because you avoided the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| If we can preserve that density aspect of it, then I think it would be a win-win in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| I'm still against that, you know, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| And I have a question for Ms. Blakeney too, and this is more of a procedural thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| because we've got a lot of friendly amendments or unfriendly amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| Say the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| If it were to be added, and I'm not for it being added, and the motion fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5182)|
| 1:26:31| where does that leave us with the whole plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| We can make another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| I'm choked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| The chair certainly has discretion in terms of how we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| And at this point, I've heard Commissioner Higgins' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| but it doesn't sound like he's actually made a motion yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| or that there's been any request for a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| So there are a couple of ways to proceed, and, again, the chair has discretion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| The matters that are for friendly amendment, those can be heard first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| If there is a motion and a second concerning the issues raised by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| those could be addressed first before proceeding to the motion on the larger picture issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| So, again, there's a lot of discretion to ensure that what the will of the body is can be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| So my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Commissioner Huber, I might be able to abbreviate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| because I know where you're going and I've already been in discussion with these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5247)|
| 1:27:34| What I'd be willing to do, if you want to end the plan and codify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| and you make a motion and you get a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| I'm willing to have that vote separate of this original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| and we can weed them out that way unless the attorney pulls me by the coat here and says you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| But I believe we can, and I think it would be simpler if we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| Yeah. I think it would be very wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| So one thing that I'm offering up to the group here is if you want to make a motion related to the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5285)|
| 1:28:17| as far as a recommendation to codify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| and I will accept a motion and a second at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| and then we can vote on it separately from Commissioner Smith's and Commissioner Browning's motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5306)|
| 1:28:35| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| Do you still understand what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I actually have a question and I think I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| My question is, we've talked about this in terms of the hillside matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| Are you also willing to do that for another matter that may or may not be a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5333)|
| 1:29:02| If it's not a friendly amendment, I am willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| There were a lot of double negatives in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| If he doesn't accept a friendly amendment, I will consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| Then I would not, I'm not talking about hillside at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| I realize you've made a request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| but I would like to ask Mr. Browning if he would accept the friendly amendment regarding the historic preservation that I mentioned earlier through Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5369)|
| 1:29:43| and I'm happy to read that again to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Let's start with Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Sorry, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| Well, and I know Director Brooks, you read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| Could you read it one more time from the historic preservation for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| This would be adding an additional action to support policy number 8.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| research and proposed incentives and development standards that encourage new development to have design compatible with historic resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5408)|
| 1:30:15| that are adjacent or in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| So essentially what this would do would provide, this would require, this would be a work program item to do additional research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| So would this be like a design review that we would see, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| comparative to the DRB with downtown when you say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| I did not craft this particular action item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| This is asking us to research and propose incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| and development standards that would encourage development to be compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| So I'm sure there's a number of different avenues to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| and at this point I couldn't say what those exactly would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| And I will explain why I am requesting this because I'm thinking about historic properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| so in the county where a development is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| and right now when we look at KGIS and we see on the map there's a historic thing close to this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| that's all we really have is, oh, there's a historic thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| And we can enter that into our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| but we don't really have anything that guides us beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| other than sort of an up-down vote on do we want this development or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| are they considering this historic area or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| And the way I'm interpreting this is that it would allow this plan to do some research in a general fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5485)|
| 1:31:34| that would then provide some guidance for when a development is coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| and there's a historic thing there that they're beside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| that gives some guidance to that development as to how they can develop in a complementary fashion with that historic thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5502)|
| 1:31:51| That's how I'm interpreting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| So it's not a, it must be this exact way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| but that there be some additional guidance for how that actually plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| If you think I'm interpreting that incorrectly, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| Well, and I was going to ask our attorney if that's how she was interpreting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| just so that there's no misinterpretation of the interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Then with that, I honestly have no problem with that as a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| to add in to 8.4, that language from the historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| And how are we defining historic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| I mean, is it all the historic register or in a district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| The Section 8 starts with all historic register and going down, like, what is a historic property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| So that is how I'm interpreting that, that it's those properties that have been designated as historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| So in our work, when we see those on that map, it's not just, oh, there's a thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| but we see that thing and have some guidance as to how that can now interact with the proposed new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| My point is there's just a big difference between something being in a historic district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| and something actually being on the historic register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| I would not want, I would not be in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| If we're going to dictate just being in a historic district, they've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| Now, if it's actually on the register, then yes, I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| I think that this also gives a lot of leeway with what could be proposed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| I mean, it could just be a simple incentive of, you know, it could be non-planning related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| Say, okay, now you're eligible to get a pilot if you want to design it within these types of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5613)|
| 1:33:40| It doesn't even have to, it doesn't have to be anything mandated necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| So 8.4 says update the historic resources inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| Little h.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| I don't really, I think it's broader than it's pieces of property that are strictly tied to the historic register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5634)|
| 1:34:04| the national register, or we need to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| If Commissioner Adams' recommendation was a recommendation for those that are on the national register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| then that's one interpretation, but I think we would need to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5656)|
| 1:34:24| If I can just weigh in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| I would say before any type of development standards or requirements were put into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| this body would have to review and make a recommendation to county commission to include those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| So this in and of itself, the way that it's, if you all were to add this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240307?start=5677)|
