| 0:01:03| We do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=63.0)|
| 0:01:06| Next item on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=66.0)|
| 0:01:09| We do have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=69.0)|
| 0:01:12| Mr. Keith Britt, if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=72.0)|
| 0:01:15| State your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=75.0)|
| 0:01:17| You have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=77.0)|
| 0:01:19| Hi, I'm Keith Britt with 6 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=79.0)|
| 0:01:22| Today I've seen nearly every prominent Republican politician tweet about National Police Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=82.0)|
| 0:01:29| With this mayor's proposed budget, the KCSO starting salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=89.0)|
| 0:01:35| a deputy would only be able to afford a home priced at about $158,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=95.0)|
| 0:01:42| As of today, there are 16 homes available in Knox County at that price level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=102.0)|
| 0:01:47| For a KCS teacher's starting salary, there's only 14 homes available for their proposed starting salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=107.0)|
| 0:01:54| Zero, meaning there are no homes available in Knox County for sale today that are halved at those price levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=114.0)|
| 0:02:03| All of those homes are complete teardowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=123.0)|
| 0:02:07| They require tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in renovations just to make them habitable for adults, much less children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=127.0)|
| 0:02:16| Since your last meeting, we've had a Farragut Middle School student arrested for, quote, threats of mass violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=136.0)|
| 0:02:27| We've had a West High School student accidentally shoot a teacher inside of a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=147.0)|
| 0:02:34| We've had three elementary schools and three high schools go on lockdown, two separate times each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=154.0)|
| 0:02:42| On top of that, we have a third grade retention law, which later this week will destined thousands of third graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=162.0)|
| 0:02:50| to either repeat a grade, engage in intensive summer school or tutoring services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=170.0)|
| 0:02:58| And as a result of that, our school system has said to all the first and second graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=178.0)|
| 0:03:03| if you need help this summer, you're out of luck because the state mandates that we have to put these third graders as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=183.0)|
| 0:03:11| And so we are setting up a generation of children to fall behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=191.0)|
| 0:03:17| They're not going to be able to realize their potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=197.0)|
| 0:03:20| They're not going to be able to take advantage of the opportunities in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=200.0)|
| 0:03:24| And they're not going to be able to grow and to contribute to our community as they or we would hope they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=204.0)|
| 0:03:32| And to all our KCS teachers and all our KCSO deputies, this budget says to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=212.0)|
| 0:03:39| we welcome you to serve our community, but we do not welcome you to be part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=219.0)|
| 0:03:45| You can serve us, but you can't be one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=225.0)|
| 0:03:50| If you think the KCSO and the KCS staff and shortages are bad now, pass this budget as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=230.0)|
| 0:03:57| Because next year, it will become much worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=237.0)|
| 0:04:02| You're going to have to make hard decisions at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=242.0)|
| 0:04:05| And the longer you wait to make those decisions, the more painful it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=245.0)|
| 0:04:10| The longer you wait to make those decisions, the more our children are going to suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=250.0)|
| 0:04:14| And the longer you wait to make those decisions, the less safe our communities are going to become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=254.0)|
| 0:04:20| So, Godspeed to this commission as you consider this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=260.0)|
| 0:04:26| I hope you have the courage to do what our mayor does not and put our people over our politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=266.0)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=273.0)|
| 0:04:35| Thank you. This concludes our public forum for this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=275.0)|
| 0:04:41| Next on our agenda, we do not have a specific list of department heads and officials wishing to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=281.0)|
| 0:04:47| However, I do see some in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=287.0)|
| 0:04:50| Commissioners, if you have any questions for them or comments, feel free to turn your light on at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=290.0)|
| 0:04:56| And with that, I will start us off with Director Caldwell to offer any comments that he has regarding this budget for fiscal year 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=296.0)|
| 0:05:11| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=311.0)|
| 0:05:14| I know that we have all met to discuss this document, so I won't bore you with a lot of repetitive stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=314.0)|
| 0:05:24| Ultimately, this budget is about a $90.3 million increase over current year FY23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=324.0)|
| 0:05:34| From budget to budget, about $65 of that $90 is related to TISA funding from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=334.0)|
| 0:05:42| And this budget includes a 4% pay increase for certified and classified school employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=342.0)|
| 0:05:50| a 3% raise for general county employees, and a proposed 8% raise for sheriff's officers, captain, and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=350.0)|
| 0:06:04| The general fund is up about $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=364.0)|
| 0:06:09| Half of that $12 million is directed toward KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=369.0)|
| 0:06:14| Engineering and Public Works is up about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=374.0)|
| 0:06:25| There's about a 12% increase in aiding this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=385.0)|
| 0:06:31| Hotel and motel tax is up about $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=391.0)|
| 0:06:36| And so, this budget, from a standpoint of a curriculum, does have growth in property tax and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=396.0)|
| 0:06:51| The sales tax growth is relatively flat from what we anticipate ending this fiscal year with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=411.0)|
| 0:07:00| I emailed with you all a report today about economic forecast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=420.0)|
| 0:07:07| and it's the same dashboard that I've been sharing with you all for a few months now with some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=427.0)|
| 0:07:15| And that dashboard has gotten increasingly more red and yellow and less green, if you know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=435.0)|
| 0:07:22| And so, basically implying that a recession is looming, and it says in there that there's some conflicting data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=442.0)|
| 0:07:33| But basically, we based this budget off the economic forecast from the Boyd Center, which basically showed flat growth for Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=453.0)|
| 0:07:46| So, that's basically just a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=466.0)|
| 0:07:51| I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=471.0)|
| 0:07:54| And I look forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=474.0)|
| 0:07:58| Thank you, Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=478.0)|
| 0:08:00| Commissioner Daley, you're on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=480.0)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=482.0)|
| 0:08:04| Director Caldwell, thank goodness we got more money back from the new formula, from the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=484.0)|
| 0:08:13| This is Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=493.0)|
| 0:08:16| Explain to everyone that's watching what the difference between the running BEP and the other $68 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=496.0)|
| 0:08:26| unless I say experts or money anyway, $68 million, and how much of that increase in that school's budget is sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=506.0)|
| 0:08:36| How much sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=516.0)|
| 0:08:38| Yeah, so I'm going to ask Ron or Joe to come down and let them talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=518.0)|
| 0:08:44| They are definitely experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=524.0)|
| 0:08:46| There's a lot of one-time growth this first year on TISA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=526.0)|
| 0:08:49| And the schools have done a good job to not put a lot of that into recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=529.0)|
| 0:08:55| I'll let them get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=535.0)|
| 0:08:56| But you mentioned sales tax dollars and property tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=536.0)|
| 0:09:02| And so, let's talk about maintenance of effort as it relates to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=542.0)|
| 0:09:07| This budget increases maintenance of effort right at $4.1 million, which is about 1.2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=547.0)|
| 0:09:16| We moved four pennies from property tax, $7.6 million, out of the general purpose school budget into debt service to pay for school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=556.0)|
| 0:09:27| And this accomplishes two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=567.0)|
| 0:09:29| One, it lowers maintenance of efforts as we're headed into an uncertain economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=569.0)|
| 0:09:35| It's a number that is attainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=575.0)|
| 0:09:37| We feel we're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=577.0)|
| 0:09:40| The second thing that it does is if anyone is asking for a TIF from county commission, you have to pay the debt service amount of property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=580.0)|
| 0:09:52| This increases that amount so the county schools, the county, would get more money on a TIF as it relates to anybody asking for an abatement on taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=592.0)|
| 0:10:05| So, from our standpoint, the increase on property tax budget to budget was about $3.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=605.0)|
| 0:10:17| I'm sorry, it went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:19| It was a decrease of about, do this math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=619.0)|
| 0:10:24| I never do math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=624.0)|
| 0:10:25| Oh, you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:26| About $3.5 million decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=626.0)|
| 0:10:29| There was an increase in property taxes of about $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=629.0)|
| 0:10:35| And so, that $5 million is kind of what we anticipated to end the year at a certain point in time, and we just kept that number flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=635.0)|
| 0:10:44| But, like I said, made its effort up just for $1.1 million, which is 1.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=644.0)|
| 0:10:50| I'm going to let Ron talk to you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=650.0)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=655.0)|
| 0:10:58| Yes, Chris accurately spoke about property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=658.0)|
| 0:11:03| So, for Moscow schools, there's a shift where pennies have resulted in a decrease after netted against natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=663.0)|
| 0:11:13| It's a decrease of about $3.6 million in property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=673.0)|
| 0:11:16| Sales tax, we're showing budget to budget, an increase of about $8.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=676.0)|
| 0:11:20| So, that net effect for a local increase is about $3.7, $3.8 million, which is about 1% of growth over and above the prior year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=680.0)|
| 0:11:33| Our largest area of increase is in fact TISA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=693.0)|
| 0:11:38| We want to be really careful of and how we commit those funds because, and I mentioned this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=698.0)|
| 0:11:46| that the growth models that the state is providing in future years appear to be very modest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=706.0)|
| 0:11:52| Sure, there's a significant increase in year one, and then afterwards it appears to be very modest increases thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=712.0)|
| 0:12:01| So, we wanted to be really guarded about not to overcommit those funds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=721.0)|
| 0:12:07| So, you don't want to commit all of those funds to recurring initiatives only to roll into the following year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=727.0)|
| 0:12:15| and not have sufficient inflationary increases in funding to sustain those initiatives that you just programmed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=735.0)|
| 0:12:23| So, when we developed the FY24 budget, we also had our eyes on FY25 and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=743.0)|
| 0:12:31| because we know that there is going to be challenges in having the capacity afforded into our budget for those subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=751.0)|
| 0:12:40| And so, when we looked at this, we wanted to be very strategic in how we programmed those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=760.0)|
| 0:12:51| And so, what we did is we looked at our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=771.0)|
| 0:12:54| We always have an eye and work very closely with Chris and his staff in an effort to mitigate those debt levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=774.0)|
| 0:13:01| What we decided is to program a significant amount of those dollars into what otherwise would have been a bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=781.0)|
| 0:13:12| It's for certain capital improvement projects, which will save us about, we estimate about $14 million over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=792.0)|
| 0:13:19| So, that was one of our strategic options to create that capacity going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=799.0)|
| 0:13:24| And then coupled with that, ESSER funding goes away in September of 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=804.0)|
| 0:13:33| So, we have some really worthwhile initiatives programmed in ESSER like tutors, mental health supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=813.0)|
| 0:13:41| classroom technology student devices, professional development opportunities for our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=821.0)|
| 0:13:49| work-based learning, career and college empowerment priority, which would include counselors and academy coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=829.0)|
| 0:14:00| and some really strong initiatives at the high school level, interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=840.0)|
| 0:14:06| So, I'm saying all of that to say that we purposely chose not to overcommit those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=846.0)|
| 0:14:13| knowing that if ESSER goes away in September 2024, we don't want to be back to the funding body saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=853.0)|
| 0:14:20| well, gee, we don't have the dollars to fund this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=860.0)|
| 0:14:25| So, we want to be really proactive in managing our dollars wisely as we look towards future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=865.0)|
| 0:14:31| And so, that's why we wanted to be careful with the additional amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=871.0)|
| 0:14:36| Because we've heard from some of our colleagues in other districts that they're programming these costs into recurring initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=876.0)|
| 0:14:45| And so, we're thinking as they're doing that, gee, you may want to be careful about that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=885.0)|
| 0:14:50| Because anything can change on future models from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=890.0)|
| 0:14:54| But based on what they share so far, the increases do appear to be very modest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=894.0)|
| 0:15:00| And so, that's why we have to be very cautious in how we program these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=900.0)|
| 0:15:07| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=907.0)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you so much for your time. I do have a couple of questions for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=911.0)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=916.0)|
| 0:15:18| Commissioner Oster, if you don't care, I will ask if anybody else has anything regarding the school's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=918.0)|
| 0:15:27| Commissioner Lee? Is that okay? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=927.0)|
| 0:15:37| Mr. Caldwell, I'd like to ask, how did the budget account for the decrease in students on the county school budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=937.0)|
| 0:15:51| One of the mayor's four priorities focuses on public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=951.0)|
| 0:15:59| And so, in our conversations with schools, historically, we have always given schools natural growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=959.0)|
| 0:16:11| And he wants to continue that trend, but also wanted to manage maintenance of effort as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=971.0)|
| 0:16:19| And so, ultimately, we moved the four pennies to debt service to manage maintenance of effort, to keep it flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=979.0)|
| 0:16:28| flat-ish, I guess you could say, so 1.2% growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=988.0)|
| 0:16:32| And so, we know that the school population is fairly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=992.0)|
| 0:16:39| But as we looked at this budget with the increased funding in TISA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=999.0)|
| 0:16:44| he was comfortable getting to a number that we obtained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1004.0)|
| 0:16:51| which would give them 1.2% of recurring growth in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1011.0)|
| 0:17:00| and allowing them to do some key priorities, which include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1020.0)|
| 0:17:04| there's a reading program that the mayor has sponsored for two or three years now, and a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1024.0)|
| 0:17:11| And so, while he knows that the population is fairly flat, this was his proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1031.0)|
| 0:17:18| and he was content with keeping maintenance of effort a little bit above what is legally required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1038.0)|
| 0:17:27| And one follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1047.0)|
| 0:17:29| So, how would that affect once the TISA funds go away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1049.0)|
| 0:17:35| So, what Ron talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1055.0)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1059.0)|
| 0:17:40| We're hopeful the TISA funds do not go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1060.0)|
| 0:17:43| What our concern is is that there's not a whole lot of growth in subsequent years for those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1063.0)|
| 0:17:48| which is why we wanted to be very cautious to not commit so many of the issues that we can't fund those in subsequent years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1068.0)|
| 0:17:56| just based on inflationary cost increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1076.0)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1079.0)|
| 0:18:01| Mr. Schuman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1081.0)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1082.0)|
| 0:18:03| Ron, I do appreciate what you do for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1083.0)|
| 0:18:07| Anybody with finance has a monumental task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1087.0)|
| 0:18:11| Well, I've got a great team, so I think it would be great to throw a budget close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1091.0)|
| 0:18:16| Well, kind of a follow-up to Commissioner Lee's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1096.0)|
| 0:18:20| I went back and I looked at when I came on County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1100.0)|
| 0:18:25| and in that 2014-2015 school year, there were 57,600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1105.0)|
| 0:18:34| And this year, your team just told me it was 58,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1114.0)|
| 0:18:40| So, in nine years, our student population has increased 1,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1120.0)|
| 0:18:46| I went back and I looked at the budget for Knox County Schools in that 2014-2015 period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1126.0)|
| 0:18:53| and noticed the difference today that in nine years, your budget has increased 54%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1133.0)|
| 0:19:00| for 1,000 more that you're having to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1140.0)|
| 0:19:05| The other question is, when you look at the state's contribution this year over last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1145.0)|
| 0:19:12| you're picking up $65.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1152.0)|
| 0:19:15| It's probably $61 million to $62 million, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1155.0)|
| 0:19:20| Okay, well, on the budget document that we have on page 25, it says it's $65.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1160.0)|
| 0:19:26| Then you're picking up some additional resources, which tops it out at $68.5 over the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1166.0)|
| 0:19:34| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1174.0)|
| 0:19:36| So, it's our responsibility as the County Commission to make sure that by state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1176.0)|
| 0:19:44| that we give you the same amount as the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1184.0)|
| 0:19:48| So, how do we tell our constituents when you're getting an extra $65.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1188.0)|
| 0:19:55| actually $68.5 million, more than what we're required to give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1195.0)|
| 0:20:01| but you're getting it from the state, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1201.0)|
| 0:20:04| that why are we not decreasing a certain portion of our property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1204.0)|
| 0:20:10| that goes towards Knox County Schools to maybe split the difference, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1210.0)|
| 0:20:15| so that we now can have the opportunity to fund county operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1215.0)|
| 0:20:21| such as the road paving and residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1221.0)|
| 0:20:26| the needed maintenance on our parks and our libraries, and our jail as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1226.0)|
| 0:20:33| So, my question is, you're getting bonus money this year that the general fund is not getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1233.0)|
| 0:20:41| but yet we're still having to fund you at the same level of property tax that we did the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1241.0)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1248.0)|
| 0:20:49| I would answer that, that over the last several years we've made incredible strides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1249.0)|
| 0:20:54| in increasing teacher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1254.0)|
| 0:20:58| We have been able to meet the memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1258.0)|
| 0:21:01| This will be, I think, the third year in a row, maybe four out of five years, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1261.0)|
| 0:21:07| Prior to that, we had never met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1267.0)|
| 0:21:09| And we have, over some of the years that you covered there, we have been from, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1269.0)|
| 0:21:16| don't hold me to this, I'm trying to do this from memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1276.0)|
| 0:21:19| maybe around 11th or 12th in the area to 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1279.0)|
| 0:21:25| And so we have, I mean, I would say, and I could, you know, I'd have to go back in previous budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1285.0)|
| 0:21:33| and where all those dollars go, but we can absolutely get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1293.0)|
| 0:21:38| For a 4% raise, it's $20 million, simply because we have 4,500 teachers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1298.0)|
| 0:21:46| We've also raised our custodial pay, educational assistant pay, school clerical pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1306.0)|
| 0:21:54| 12% this year, 8% in the two years prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1314.0)|
| 0:21:58| So a considerable amount of those dollars has gone towards what we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1318.0)|
| 0:22:04| very critical positions for the mission of our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1324.0)|
| 0:22:09| What we were finding is that some of our better teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1329.0)|
| 0:22:12| and we still have some of this dynamic going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1332.0)|
| 0:22:14| some of our better teachers routinely were going to other surrounding districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1334.0)|
| 0:22:21| They were considerably more, like Maryville and Oak Ridge and Alcoa and some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1341.0)|
| 0:22:28| And so we were, in a sense, trying to stop the leak, but we had a long ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1348.0)|
| 0:22:32| And so we've programmed a lot of those dollars, like over the last, those years you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1352.0)|
| 0:22:37| I mean, that's a significant amount of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1357.0)|
| 0:22:40| And so we've programmed that a lot of, also into these critical positions that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1360.0)|
| 0:22:48| to be quite honest, we're struggling to find, we're struggling to fill vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1368.0)|
| 0:22:52| And so it's been a purposeful decision to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1372.0)|
| 0:22:58| So I'm not saying that's where all of our initiatives went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1378.0)|
| 0:23:01| That's where a considerable amount of the dollars have gone back into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1381.0)|
| 0:23:05| So I think Tennessee is probably, don't hold me to this either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1385.0)|
| 0:23:12| but maybe about 41st in per-pupil funding in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1392.0)|
| 0:23:17| And I think, I can't speak for the governor, but I think with the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1397.0)|
| 0:23:21| with this significant reform to education, he also has in mind that, sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1401.0)|
| 0:23:29| enrollment has decreased in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1409.0)|
| 0:23:31| In fact, it's decreased across the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1411.0)|
| 0:23:34| But he came out with this initiative anyway because we were, so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1414.0)|
| 0:23:38| we were lagging so far in student investments with respect to the nation as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1418.0)|
| 0:23:44| And I think in spite of the fact that maybe we're having a smaller amount of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1424.0)|
| 0:23:50| or a smaller number of enrollment, he wants to increase the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1430.0)|
| 0:23:55| in those students that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1435.0)|
| 0:23:57| And so we actually were on a trajectory of increasing enrollment and then COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1437.0)|
| 0:24:02| And so when that hit, everybody started seeing a lot of those numbers coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1442.0)|
| 0:24:08| They're gradually coming back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1448.0)|
| 0:24:11| So anyway, I don't know if that answered your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1451.0)|
| 0:24:15| but I can tell you that's where a lot of our focus has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1455.0)|
| 0:24:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1460.0)|
| 0:24:21| So of the $68 million, you're going to use $20 million for teacher salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1461.0)|
| 0:24:25| It's about half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1465.0)|
| 0:24:27| So it's going to be 4% increase for teachers, all personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1467.0)|
| 0:24:32| It's going to be, well, 12% would also be for security guards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1472.0)|
| 0:24:41| educational assistants, school clerical, and who am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1481.0)|
| 0:24:48| Custodians, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1488.0)|
| 0:24:50| So that's probably about half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1490.0)|
| 0:24:51| As I look at some of our other investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1491.0)|
| 0:24:55| and when I sent this I sent something to the finance committee as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1495.0)|
| 0:24:59| that kind of, I think, laid out what the investments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1499.0)|
| 0:25:05| I will tell you that about $23 million, $24 million of those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1505.0)|
| 0:25:09| are going into capital to pay down the debt that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1509.0)|
| 0:25:13| that will save us $14 million over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1513.0)|
| 0:25:16| Because previous to this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1516.0)|
| 0:25:19| we have about $18 or $19 million of recurring debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1519.0)|
| 0:25:22| in the general purpose budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1522.0)|
| 0:25:24| So that's why we wanted to pay part of that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1524.0)|
| 0:25:27| so that we could have the ability to program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1527.0)|
| 0:25:31| to do some educational issues that we otherwise wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1531.0)|
| 0:25:34| That goes back to the fact that we didn't want to overcommit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1534.0)|
| 0:25:36| those TISA dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1536.0)|
| 0:25:38| $7 million of the increase would be school-based funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1538.0)|
| 0:25:44| where we've been giving schools more teaching positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1544.0)|
| 0:25:48| We had a staffing committee this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1548.0)|
| 0:25:49| We listened to principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1549.0)|
| 0:25:51| There were some things that were very important for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1551.0)|
| 0:25:53| things like behavioral supports and additional academic supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1553.0)|
| 0:25:58| We plan to program more supports into our Region 5 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1558.0)|
| 0:26:01| in an effort to close that learning gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1561.0)|
| 0:26:05| We also had almost $7 million of maintenance increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1565.0)|
| 0:26:09| largely a result of inflationary costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1569.0)|
| 0:26:13| And then we had, on our priority-based initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1573.0)|
| 0:26:18| investments in things in support of our early literacy initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1578.0)|
| 0:26:25| our middle school math foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1585.0)|
| 0:26:27| We also programmed additional behavior supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1587.0)|
| 0:26:31| and pre-K expansion because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1591.0)|
| 0:26:33| those were areas that our principals were very strongly asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1593.0)|
| 0:26:37| for additional help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1597.0)|
| 0:26:38| So we talked with principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1598.0)|
| 0:26:40| We actually did a budget survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1600.0)|
| 0:26:42| We met with regional focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1602.0)|
| 0:26:44| which is parents and teachers out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:47| This was, I would say, the most collaborative budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1607.0)|
| 0:26:51| with respect to the community and even staff that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1611.0)|
| 0:26:55| So we try to use all of those factors to draft this budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1615.0)|
| 0:27:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1621.0)|
| 0:27:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1622.0)|
| 0:27:07| Commissioner Hill has indicated she has a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1627.0)|
| 0:27:10| for schools and then anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1630.0)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1632.0)|
| 0:27:13| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1633.0)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1634.0)|
| 0:27:15| And thank you, Ron, for the explanation you gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1635.0)|
| 0:27:19| Just to kind of follow up on new programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1639.0)|
| 0:27:25| things that tend to suck up what sounds like a huge amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1645.0)|
| 0:27:30| but in the end it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1650.0)|
| 0:27:33| I know one of the things that the schools have been very proactive in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1653.0)|
| 0:27:37| is adding to their summer school programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1657.0)|
| 0:27:39| That has expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1659.0)|
| 0:27:42| We service more students and more schools than we did in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1662.0)|
| 0:27:47| Some of that also becomes directly related to new state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1667.0)|
| 0:27:55| and federal requirements that are continually put on the school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1675.0)|
| 0:27:59| where they expect more and more for each school to do and to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1679.0)|
| 0:28:06| but do not put the dollars behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1686.0)|
| 0:28:09| So that falls directly on the school system too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1689.0)|
| 0:28:13| Also the increase on our mental health needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1693.0)|
| 0:28:18| I can't speak enough to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1698.0)|
| 0:28:21| We are really seeing the leftovers of the issues that occurred during COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1701.0)|
| 0:28:30| that are coming directly into our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1710.0)|
| 0:28:33| and the increase in behavioral issues and problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1713.0)|
| 0:28:42| and the need for more consistent mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1722.0)|
| 0:28:46| You can't get in there and just plug a hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1726.0)|
| 0:28:49| and think that it's not going to pop somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1729.0)|
| 0:28:52| And I applaud the schools because you have started expanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1732.0)|
| 0:28:57| Another thing too that I just might add to all this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1737.0)|
| 0:29:02| it's not only, even though enrollment may have dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1742.0)|
| 0:29:06| the distribution of students and where they all decide to land themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1746.0)|
| 0:29:10| in our county has not dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1750.0)|
| 0:29:12| In fact, they have spread out even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1752.0)|
| 0:29:15| So this results in a thousand less students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1755.0)|
| 0:29:18| It may sound like that should equal 20 less teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1758.0)|
| 0:29:21| Well, if they all left the same school in the same grade, it probably would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1761.0)|
| 0:29:26| But when you spread that out over 90 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1766.0)|
| 0:29:29| you still end up just about always having to have the same amount of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1769.0)|
| 0:29:36| regardless of a drop in enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1776.0)|
| 0:29:39| So just a few more things to throw into my support of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1779.0)|
| 0:29:46| Appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1786.0)|
| 0:29:48| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1788.0)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1790.0)|
| 0:29:51| I have a follow-up question on Commissioner Schoonmaker's line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1791.0)|
| 0:29:55| So there's a thousand more kids, 54% increase in budget from when you started, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1795.0)|
| 0:30:03| So nine districts, 12 grades plus kindergarten and pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1803.0)|
| 0:30:09| So you're looking at somewhere around five, six kids per grade increase per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1809.0)|
| 0:30:16| So not like a crazy amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1816.0)|
| 0:30:19| But how much staff increase have we had since that time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1819.0)|
| 0:30:27| We'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1827.0)|
| 0:30:28| We could get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1828.0)|
| 0:30:30| I can tell you that we kind of along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1830.0)|
| 0:30:34| So typically we have unbudgeted positions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1834.0)|
| 0:30:39| Because we will, through the year, we may have, like, a BEP requirement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1839.0)|
| 0:30:45| oh, gee, more kids showed up in the first grade than what we were anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1845.0)|
| 0:30:49| State law says we have to put another teacher there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1849.0)|
| 0:30:51| It's funded entirely from local, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1851.0)|
| 0:30:53| So we have a lot of that going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1853.0)|
| 0:30:54| We also have a lot of with regards to special education needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1854.0)|
| 0:30:58| So if a child is an IEP and we're required by law to meet that IEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1858.0)|
| 0:31:04| then if it's anything additional above what we've already programmed with federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1864.0)|
| 0:31:08| or local dollars in the budget, we have to come up and pay for all of that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1868.0)|
| 0:31:12| We had, I think, about 20-some-odd positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1872.0)|
| 0:31:16| And the reason I'm saying it for this year, this is kind of par for the course, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1876.0)|
| 0:31:20| So I think we had about 24 positions, maybe, to go back and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1880.0)|
| 0:31:25| that we had to add to the budget that were not even budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1885.0)|
| 0:31:28| But over 90% of those were school-based positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1888.0)|
| 0:31:31| like special education teachers, ELL teachers, right, educational assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1891.0)|
| 0:31:38| Typically, that's where we see the increase in staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1898.0)|
| 0:31:43| I know this year the superintendent was pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1903.0)|
| 0:31:47| we're not going to add to central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1907.0)|
| 0:31:52| And to be blunt, a lot of us submitted proposals that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1912.0)|
| 0:31:56| hey, gee, we could need a few more teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1916.0)|
| 0:31:58| Or not teachers, but staff, you know, to do this, to do that, to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1918.0)|
| 0:32:03| And he was pretty clear that his intent, based on the four core priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1923.0)|
| 0:32:08| is to fund those at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1928.0)|
| 0:32:10| And that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1930.0)|
| 0:32:13| Which I get, you know, more staff is always great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1933.0)|
| 0:32:16| because kids get more individual attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1936.0)|
| 0:32:19| You know, 20 more staff members is a million bucks right there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1939.0)|
| 0:32:24| They're all around $50,000 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1944.0)|
| 0:32:26| But I'm kind of looking for more of, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1946.0)|
| 0:32:29| have we increased the 54% over eight years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1949.0)|
| 0:32:35| Nine years, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1955.0)|
| 0:32:37| Trying to give you a year younger than you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1957.0)|
| 0:32:41| You know, is this 20 more teachers, 100 more teachers, 500 more teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1961.0)|
| 0:32:47| 1,000 more teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1967.0)|
| 0:32:48| Because we have the same amount of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1968.0)|
| 0:32:49| We can find that answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1969.0)|
| 0:32:50| We can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1970.0)|
| 0:32:52| Are we seeing results from our kids getting better grades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1972.0)|
| 0:32:56| Are they doing better in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1976.0)|
| 0:32:58| I guess we're giving them more individual attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1978.0)|
| 0:33:00| So I would like to see some kind of result for the 54% increased investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1980.0)|
| 0:33:06| in the same amount of children that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1986.0)|
| 0:33:10| What tangible results are we delivering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1990.0)|
| 0:33:13| You know, I had special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1993.0)|
| 0:33:16| I'm dyslexic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1996.0)|
| 0:33:17| I can't read, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1997.0)|
| 0:33:19| It's very tough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=1999.0)|
| 0:33:20| So I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2000.0)|
| 0:33:21| I had a tutor that the high school provided for me to help me read better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2001.0)|
| 0:33:25| So I get that those are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2005.0)|
| 0:33:28| I'm just trying to see, well, was it 20 kids that were getting taught by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2008.0)|
| 0:33:32| or is it now five kids to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2012.0)|
| 0:33:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2014.0)|
| 0:33:35| Something like that where I can understand where that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2015.0)|
| 0:33:38| 54% of that half a billion dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2018.0)|
| 0:33:41| well, that's a considerable amount of money we're talking about here over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2021.0)|
| 0:33:45| nine-year period, which is, you're talking about 50 million increase a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2025.0)|
| 0:33:48| year over year kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2028.0)|
| 0:33:50| And we can definitely get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2030.0)|
| 0:33:51| In fact, I think you make a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2031.0)|
| 0:33:54| Because we're confronted with the fact that ESSER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2034.0)|
| 0:33:57| a significant number of positions are funded with their ESSER dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2037.0)|
| 0:34:00| And we're in conversations with our colleagues across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2040.0)|
| 0:34:03| with Tennessee Department of Ed, with SCORE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2043.0)|
| 0:34:05| on how best to measure those returns on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2045.0)|
| 0:34:08| Because when we want to look at those initiatives to perhaps program back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2048.0)|
| 0:34:11| into the budget, we need to have a really good reason to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2051.0)|
| 0:34:15| or to demonstrate how they're working through the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2055.0)|
| 0:34:18| I'd like to know how many administrators you've had from over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2058.0)|
| 0:34:21| nine years to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2061.0)|
| 0:34:22| Because in theory, you have the same amount of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2062.0)|
| 0:34:25| How much did the administration increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2065.0)|
| 0:34:28| How much did they expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2068.0)|
| 0:34:30| Since there's still the same amount of children to manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2070.0)|
| 0:34:32| are we now having more managers for less teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2072.0)|
| 0:34:35| or is there more teachers for managers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2075.0)|
| 0:34:38| So I would like to see how many more teachers we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2078.0)|
| 0:34:40| how many more special ed teachers we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2080.0)|
| 0:34:42| how much more management we have broken down so we can really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2082.0)|
| 0:34:45| where hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2085.0)|
| 0:34:49| We don't want to owe it to our parents to tell them where their money is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2089.0)|
| 0:34:52| actually being directed and how those resources are being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2092.0)|
| 0:34:55| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2095.0)|
| 0:34:57| When we did our survey with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2097.0)|
| 0:35:00| one of the things we hear is we want lower people-teacher ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2100.0)|
| 0:35:06| We want more teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2106.0)|
| 0:35:08| But there does come a point where it's like we want to be just throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2108.0)|
| 0:35:14| people or resources at something doesn't fix the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2114.0)|
| 0:35:18| So we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2118.0)|
| 0:35:20| And so there's that area where we constantly need to be evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2120.0)|
| 0:35:25| As a parent, I would want better ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2125.0)|
| 0:35:29| I completely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2129.0)|
| 0:35:31| It's a reasonable request in my simple brain to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2131.0)|
| 0:35:37| all right, well, if we gave you 50% more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2137.0)|
| 0:35:39| are my kids getting more attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2139.0)|
| 0:35:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2142.0)|
| 0:35:43| And we have invested in significantly more interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2143.0)|
| 0:35:46| significantly more instructional coaches to try to meet some of those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2146.0)|
| 0:35:51| We can get that information, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2151.0)|
| 0:35:53| We definitely can get that to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2153.0)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2155.0)|
| 0:35:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2156.0)|
| 0:35:58| And if I may, I would like to add a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2158.0)|
| 0:36:00| Just from being a public school teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2160.0)|
| 0:36:02| there are some schools that are overpopulated or more populated than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2162.0)|
| 0:36:07| others to where the current state requirement is a maximum of 35 in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2167.0)|
| 0:36:13| high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2173.0)|
| 0:36:15| One teacher for 35 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2175.0)|
| 0:36:17| And I've had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2177.0)|
| 0:36:19| And it is nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2179.0)|
| 0:36:20| It is absolutely 100% nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2180.0)|
| 0:36:22| And then I've been in a classroom where I've had 20 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2182.0)|
| 0:36:27| And, of course, that's more manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2187.0)|
| 0:36:29| So, you know, it all depends on where those extra positions are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2189.0)|
| 0:36:34| And more than likely, I don't want to speak for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2194.0)|
| 0:36:37| I would assume that it's going to those places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2197.0)|
| 0:36:40| those schools that are more populated than others to actually, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2200.0)|
| 0:36:45| lower that student to teacher ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2205.0)|
| 0:36:47| Because it is a hard thing to do in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2207.0)|
| 0:36:52| And then when you have so many students in one class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2212.0)|
| 0:36:55| it is a lot harder to actually meet those individual needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2215.0)|
| 0:36:58| And so I do know from experience that that tends to be the placement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2218.0)|
| 0:37:04| those extra positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2224.0)|
| 0:37:06| That kind of goes to my point, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2226.0)|
| 0:37:08| because over nine years we've had basically flat amount of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2228.0)|
| 0:37:13| So, in theory, what you're saying should be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2233.0)|
| 0:37:16| If we give you 54% more money over a nine-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2236.0)|
| 0:37:20| shouldn't our children be getting better attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2240.0)|
| 0:37:23| Shouldn't there no longer be 35-person classrooms if we've given you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2243.0)|
| 0:37:27| 54% increase with the same amount of kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2247.0)|
| 0:37:30| The common sense tells me if I give you an extra $150 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2250.0)|
| 0:37:33| you could find a couple teachers to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2253.0)|
| 0:37:35| So I'd like to know that we hired a couple teachers is all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2255.0)|
| 0:37:38| So I think there should be a considerable amount more now than there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2258.0)|
| 0:37:43| was nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2263.0)|
| 0:37:45| If you have $150 million more or however many, $200 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2265.0)|
| 0:37:48| there you go, $230 million more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2268.0)|
| 0:37:51| I would hope we could pay some teachers to come work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2271.0)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2276.0)|
| 0:38:00| Any more for school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2280.0)|
| 0:38:02| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2282.0)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2284.0)|
| 0:38:06| Before I ask my school question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2286.0)|
| 0:38:08| it seems like we're just starting to get into the meat of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2288.0)|
| 0:38:13| and given that we have a finance committee at three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2293.0)|
| 0:38:15| there's no statutory requirement that we actually have that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2295.0)|
| 0:38:19| And as the chair of the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2299.0)|
| 0:38:22| I'm going to look to my colleagues and propose that maybe we forego that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2302.0)|
| 0:38:26| meeting, stay on budget, since it's all interrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2306.0)|
| 0:38:29| There are reports from finance schools and trustee online to digest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2309.0)|
| 0:38:35| and we can follow up with any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2315.0)|
| 0:38:37| But if I don't, without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2317.0)|
| 0:38:39| if there's any objections to just continue on with budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2319.0)|
| 0:38:43| because we have a four o'clock beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2323.0)|
| 0:38:45| So let's do that if that's okay with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2325.0)|
| 0:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2327.0)|
| 0:38:48| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2328.0)|
| 0:38:50| Superintendent Roswick, as we get into the discussion, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2330.0)|
| 0:38:56| we're not the school board and we aren't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2336.0)|
| 0:38:58| digging into the budget like the school board members were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2338.0)|
| 0:39:04| I think there's probably some perspective here that you could share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2344.0)|
| 0:39:08| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2348.0)|
| 0:39:09| perhaps we were underfunding things before and now we're funding them at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2349.0)|
| 0:39:13| appropriate level. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2353.0)|
| 0:39:14| But you're obviously have dug in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2354.0)|
| 0:39:17| in the last year to understand where the school system has come from over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2357.0)|
| 0:39:23| the last, you know, 10 to 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2363.0)|
| 0:39:25| which you've been a part of in some way, shape, and form from a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2365.0)|
| 0:39:28| from an educator all the way to the leader of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2368.0)|
| 0:39:31| And then where you're planning on taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2371.0)|
| 0:39:33| Could you shed some light on kind of just the general discussion and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2373.0)|
| 0:39:37| and maybe what we're trying to do and why that requires additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2377.0)|
| 0:39:42| No, thank you, commissioner Jay. That's actually why I was moving down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2382.0)|
| 0:39:46| So thanks for, for bringing me up. Cause I do think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2386.0)|
| 0:39:49| I do think positioning this a little bit differently. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2389.0)|
| 0:39:52| the questions you all are asking are great questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2392.0)|
| 0:39:54| kind of comparing every year over year to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2394.0)|
| 0:39:58| But I think it's important to note that a couple of things I'll go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2398.0)|
| 0:40:02| one to commissioner Jay's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2402.0)|
| 0:40:04| And I think this is what commissioner Hill was trying to make the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2404.0)|
| 0:40:06| as well. Years ago, 10 years ago, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2406.0)|
| 0:40:10| there was a movement by the state to start an RTI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2410.0)|
| 0:40:13| which was a, was a response to intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2413.0)|
| 0:40:16| which meant every student not perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2416.0)|
| 0:40:18| We were going to assess students if they weren't performing a certain level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2418.0)|
| 0:40:21| we then we're going to provide so much intervention with them daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2421.0)|
| 0:40:25| Some kids 30 minutes a day, some kids 45 minutes a day. It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2425.0)|
| 0:40:28| It's the right thing to do for every student who's behind the earlier we catch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2428.0)|
| 0:40:32| them, the better it is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2432.0)|
| 0:40:33| The gaps are smallest when they're in first grade and kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2433.0)|
| 0:40:36| and they are that time they get to high school. So that was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2436.0)|
| 0:40:39| We started assessing those students 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2439.0)|
| 0:40:41| There were no dollars from the state for all the extra interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2441.0)|
| 0:40:45| either teaching assistants or teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2445.0)|
| 0:40:47| or sometimes teachers teaching during their plan period to make those kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2447.0)|
| 0:40:51| things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2451.0)|
| 0:40:52| We've continued to put that the duct tape that together over the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2452.0)|
| 0:40:55| And I think what we've continued to push in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2455.0)|
| 0:40:58| at least my time in Knox County schools is we need more of the funding from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2458.0)|
| 0:41:03| the state, you know, and even to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2463.0)|
| 0:41:05| there's a lot of unfunded mandates to things like intervention that we never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2465.0)|
| 0:41:09| had the chance to do. I think Governor Lee, this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2469.0)|
| 0:41:12| I think one time that we get intervention dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2472.0)|
| 0:41:14| Governor Haslam did one time a small amount of dollars to put toward it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2474.0)|
| 0:41:17| not reoccurring after that. And then I think, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2477.0)|
| 0:41:20| so what we've seen with Governor Lee this time is the investment in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2480.0)|
| 0:41:23| future. He sees everyone moving to Tennessee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2483.0)|
| 0:41:25| He sees the jobs that are here, the future of all that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2485.0)|
| 0:41:28| And so I think the state finally did ante up with the new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2488.0)|
| 0:41:31| the new TISA funding model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2491.0)|
| 0:41:33| We know the BEP model was not where it needed to be and the idea and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2493.0)|
| 0:41:37| everything we've heard over the course of the last year was the idea is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2497.0)|
| 0:41:39| state puts in the money and the locals keep their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2499.0)|
| 0:41:42| We now will have a chance to do these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2502.0)|
| 0:41:44| So, you know, when you look at our third grade literacy rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2504.0)|
| 0:41:47| we're the highest of the five major metropolitan areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2507.0)|
| 0:41:51| but we're still between 35 and 40%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2511.0)|
| 0:41:54| And to Commissioner Hill's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2514.0)|
| 0:41:56| now with the new legislation in place about third grade retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2516.0)|
| 0:41:59| that means about 60% of our third graders have the potential to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2519.0)|
| 0:42:02| retained, right? You've heard that from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2522.0)|
| 0:42:05| We've heard that from ours as well. People who are asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2525.0)|
| 0:42:08| Again, with that, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2528.0)|
| 0:42:10| There is the summer programming that's there. There's the tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2530.0)|
| 0:42:13| Right now we're floating that on some federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2533.0)|
| 0:42:15| but that goes away next year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2535.0)|
| 0:42:17| We have one more year of that left and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2537.0)|
| 0:42:19| but the law didn't change, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2539.0)|
| 0:42:21| So we still have to have those levels of support for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2541.0)|
| 0:42:23| We actually now are looking, you've seen some of that work into pre-K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2543.0)|
| 0:42:26| kindergarten, first and second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2546.0)|
| 0:42:28| That's the real uncharted land where we have to make that difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2548.0)|
| 0:42:32| because third grade is almost too late when you take that first assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2552.0)|
| 0:42:35| The feds require third grade to be the testing point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2555.0)|
| 0:42:38| but really we should be looking back into our pre-K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2558.0)|
| 0:42:40| kindergarten, first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2560.0)|
| 0:42:42| The ultimate goal and what I was pushing for for the state and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2562.0)|

| 0:42:51| And then if you want to pass a retention law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2571.0)|
| 0:42:53| I'm sure there'll be a lot fewer kids to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2573.0)|
| 0:42:55| So just now are we getting to Commissioner Jay's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2575.0)|
| 0:42:59| the funding levels that we need to be able to do the work we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2579.0)|
| 0:43:02| for students that have kept us stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2582.0)|
| 0:43:04| Our data has been pretty stagnant for about the last 10 years when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2584.0)|

| 0:43:10| when you look at our third grade reading proficiencies because our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2590.0)|
| 0:43:13| teachers are doing everything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2593.0)|

| 0:43:17| Our custodians are doing everything they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2597.0)|
| 0:43:19| But now we have this influx of state dollars and the whole goal was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2599.0)|
| 0:43:22| to change to where local would then say, oh great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2602.0)|
| 0:43:25| how do we get it back to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2605.0)|
| 0:43:26| But that we finally can can fund at those places where we can make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2606.0)|
| 0:43:29| difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2609.0)|
| 0:43:30| I think that's an investment one from the governor in the future of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2610.0)|
| 0:43:33| state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2613.0)|
| 0:43:34| I've seen the same from from Mayor Jacobs that he understands this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2614.0)|
| 0:43:37| commitment to the future jobs that we see employers coming in saying we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2617.0)|
| 0:43:41| need this educated workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2621.0)|
| 0:43:43| And 60% of kids not proficient in third grade is not going to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2623.0)|
| 0:43:46| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2626.0)|
| 0:43:47| So that's one case we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2627.0)|
| 0:43:49| We've seen those kinds of things continue for us as we move to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2629.0)|
| 0:43:53| So I'm thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2633.0)|
| 0:43:55| I know you all and how supportive you have been to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2635.0)|
| 0:43:58| Another wall that came in too was we're going to be required to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2638.0)|
| 0:44:02| starting salary for teachers to $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2642.0)|
| 0:44:04| That was another thing the governor put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2644.0)|
| 0:44:06| In order to do that, we can't do that in one pop, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2646.0)|
| 0:44:08| So you've got to do that slowly over the course of the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2648.0)|
| 0:44:11| I appreciate Ron and his team and Chris, us thinking about how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2651.0)|
| 0:44:14| strategically do that over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2654.0)|
| 0:44:16| That's why you didn't see a lot of us to offer a lot of other things from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2656.0)|
| 0:44:20| our board to spend down dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2660.0)|
| 0:44:22| Instead, we're saying how do we free up dollars by paying off debt so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2662.0)|
| 0:44:25| that in future years we can continue to make that slow movement up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2665.0)|
| 0:44:28| that $50,000 that's going to be required by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2668.0)|
| 0:44:30| So the money did come from the state, but it came with expectations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2670.0)|
| 0:44:34| we have to deliver off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2674.0)|
| 0:44:36| So that's why I say thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2676.0)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you for supporting what we're doing in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2678.0)|
| 0:44:40| Again, I know where your hearts are and how much you care for what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2680.0)|
| 0:44:43| trying to do for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2683.0)|
| 0:44:44| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2684.0)|
| 0:44:47| I don't know if you had any other questions, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2687.0)|
| 0:44:50| Anyone else have anything for the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2690.0)|
| 0:44:53| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2693.0)|
| 0:44:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2694.0)|
| 0:44:55| It's not really a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2695.0)|
| 0:44:56| I'm just sitting here thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2696.0)|
| 0:45:00| You know, sometimes percentage increases over time can be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2700.0)|
| 0:45:05| bit deceiving because when you start talking about dollars and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2705.0)|
| 0:45:10| percentages, ten years is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2710.0)|
| 0:45:14| And I believe the cumulative inflation of the last ten years is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2714.0)|
| 0:45:18| over 27%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2718.0)|
| 0:45:20| So, you know, if you just maintain status quo and you talk about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2720.0)|
| 0:45:25| increased cost of non-salary expenditures and then you add to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2725.0)|
| 0:45:31| pay increases for personnel that might be above the inflation rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2731.0)|
| 0:45:35| as you would hope they would be with the school system, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2735.0)|
| 0:45:38| probably surprisingly close to that 54% number in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2738.0)|
| 0:45:42| So I don't think it's quite the windfall it might sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2742.0)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2747.0)|
| 0:45:53| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2753.0)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2754.0)|
| 0:45:55| I know it's my second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2755.0)|
| 0:45:57| Every time I meet my counterparts throughout the state and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2757.0)|
| 0:46:02| representatives and the senators, I ask them, we've got billions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2762.0)|
| 0:46:05| dollars sitting in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2765.0)|
| 0:46:08| We've got a lottery fund that's got billions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2768.0)|
| 0:46:11| Why not hire TAs for pre-K, kindergarten, first, second, third grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2771.0)|
| 0:46:18| And when they get there, they're able to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2778.0)|
| 0:46:20| But I can't get a straight answer from any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2780.0)|
| 0:46:22| They just don't look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2782.0)|
| 0:46:25| If my son could not read by third grade level and he's only had one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2785.0)|
| 0:46:29| teacher per class all the time, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2789.0)|
| 0:46:33| Turn loose some of that money and maybe you have more power of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2793.0)|
| 0:46:36| will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2796.0)|
| 0:46:37| Turn loose some of that money and let's hire more TAs pre-K to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2797.0)|
| 0:46:41| third grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2801.0)|
| 0:46:42| And I think it won't solve the problem, but it will help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2802.0)|
| 0:46:46| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2806.0)|
| 0:46:48| I would agree, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2808.0)|
| 0:46:49| And I think that's what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2809.0)|
| 0:46:52| You know, we saw this years ago on graduation rates, about ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2812.0)|
| 0:46:55| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2815.0)|
| 0:46:56| Everybody started worrying about graduation rates and they put all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2816.0)|
| 0:46:58| the energy in the senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2818.0)|
| 0:46:59| Well, that's not when you make a graduate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2819.0)|
| 0:47:01| It goes back to that's a 13-year culmination of the work, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2821.0)|
| 0:47:05| the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2825.0)|
| 0:47:06| Third grade, there's nothing magic in a kid's head that clicks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2826.0)|
| 0:47:09| third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2829.0)|
| 0:47:10| There's a lot of kids who can read prior to kindergarten and moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2830.0)|
| 0:47:12| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2832.0)|
| 0:47:13| So it is getting those individualized interventions to that level so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2833.0)|
| 0:47:16| that it does pay off in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2836.0)|
| 0:47:18| And so putting resource there matters and, yeah, we'll take anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2838.0)|
| 0:47:22| the state will give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2842.0)|
| 0:47:23| That always helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2843.0)|
| 0:47:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2844.0)|
| 0:47:25| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2845.0)|
| 0:47:27| Well, Commissioner Daley took my comment about TAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2847.0)|
| 0:47:33| You and I actually discussed it in the training that I had when I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2853.0)|
| 0:47:37| on as commissioner, and I'm going to show my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2857.0)|
| 0:47:39| But my oldest is 31, and throughout the boys going through school, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2859.0)|
| 0:47:45| all had TAs in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2865.0)|
| 0:47:47| Some of them got lucky enough to have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2867.0)|
| 0:47:49| And so when you're talking about kids that can't read on the level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2869.0)|
| 0:47:53| they're struggling with math, whatever the issue is, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2873.0)|
| 0:47:56| actually have a TA and that teacher now, like Commissioner Durrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2876.0)|
| 0:48:00| said, if a teacher is trying to teach to the top, the bottom, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2880.0)|
| 0:48:04| everywhere in between at 35 or even at 20, if you have another person in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2884.0)|
| 0:48:11| that classroom, that's where it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2891.0)|
| 0:48:14| That's where the rubber hits the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2894.0)|
| 0:48:16| And so as much as I appreciate the school systems initiatives of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2896.0)|
| 0:48:21| academies and this kind of stuff, I think we're getting away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2901.0)|
| 0:48:25| actual importance of having more people in the classroom for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2905.0)|
| 0:48:32| And I know that I've heard from some parents that, you know, I lived at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2912.0)|
| 0:48:37| the school more than I was at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2917.0)|
| 0:48:40| And I don't think the parents are utilized near as much as they used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2920.0)|
| 0:48:44| be for whatever reason that is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2924.0)|
| 0:48:47| So the environment has changed totally from when mine were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2927.0)|
| 0:48:54| But mine also graduated on time, and they were reading on schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2934.0)|
| 0:48:58| and they graduated college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2938.0)|
| 0:49:00| And, you know, that had something to do with, obviously, parental support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2940.0)|
| 0:49:05| but it had to do with teachers and the TAs in there being able to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2945.0)|
| 0:49:09| them on that small level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2949.0)|
| 0:49:11| So I would hope to see if we're going to hire some more people, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2951.0)|
| 0:49:14| understand support staff, but, you know, TAs, that's where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2954.0)|
| 0:49:18| And we're not paying these people a ton of money, which is another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2958.0)|
| 0:49:23| But I just think that we need to really gear that back up and get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2963.0)|
| 0:49:28| classrooms full again with some help for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2968.0)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2971.0)|
| 0:49:32| I just want to say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2972.0)|
| 0:49:33| I know Mr. McPherson said that that was a commitment of ours in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2973.0)|
| 0:49:36| budget, not to add, but to add to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2976.0)|
| 0:49:39| And so, like the academy structures that we've gone to and the eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2979.0)|
| 0:49:43| high schools that have done that, there have been we didn't change our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2983.0)|
| 0:49:47| staffing formula for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2987.0)|
| 0:49:49| So we did it on the existing staffing formula that we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2989.0)|
| 0:49:52| There are two positions at those high schools that are federally funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2992.0)|
| 0:49:56| that we've put into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2996.0)|
| 0:49:57| So that wasn't an extra spend into those schools to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=2997.0)|
| 0:50:01| Our teaching assistants, and even I would put tutors in that same boat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3001.0)|
| 0:50:04| and now that's a requirement by the state as one of the ways for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3004.0)|
| 0:50:07| not to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3007.0)|
| 0:50:10| Well, that ratio has to be one to three, which is great, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3010.0)|
| 0:50:13| But one to three is a lot of tutors that we have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3013.0)|
| 0:50:17| So they'll make kind of an hourly or it could be potentially close to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3017.0)|
| 0:50:20| where a teaching assistant is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3020.0)|
| 0:50:21| But we understand that, too, and that's why in this budget that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3021.0)|
| 0:50:25| board approved, they recognize that as well and put the raise additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3025.0)|
| 0:50:29| dollars to try to fill some of the gaps that we have in not having those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3029.0)|
| 0:50:33| in classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3033.0)|
| 0:50:34| We have vacant positions for teaching assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3034.0)|
| 0:50:36| So we know how important they are, and every school who has those knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3036.0)|
| 0:50:39| how important that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3039.0)|
| 0:50:40| So for us to continue to have a competitive wage for them as well is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3040.0)|
| 0:50:43| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3043.0)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3044.0)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3045.0)|
| 0:50:46| I guess I will now go into my questions for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3046.0)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3049.0)|
| 0:50:52| Chris, I've got a few for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3052.0)|
| 0:50:58| The first one is, why did we move money in Will Tax to Engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3058.0)|
| 0:51:03| PW Fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3063.0)|
| 0:51:06| Yeah, so can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3066.0)|
| 0:51:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3068.0)|
| 0:51:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3069.0)|
| 0:51:10| So we'll talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3070.0)|
| 0:51:13| We moved 900,000 from schools to Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3073.0)|
| 0:51:23| Basically, if you ever read the ordinance that passed on Will Tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3083.0)|
| 0:51:28| it's very broad on what it can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3088.0)|
| 0:51:31| And so Commissioner Schoonmaker came to schools and thought it would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3091.0)|
| 0:51:36| good idea if some of this went towards Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3096.0)|
| 0:51:39| They agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3099.0)|
| 0:51:41| And so we moved half of their funding of that toward Engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3101.0)|
| 0:51:45| Public Works, kept half at General Purpose School Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3105.0)|
| 0:51:50| but tied it to the Mayor's Reading Program and the Elevate Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3110.0)|
| 0:51:57| And so that's what that is still there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3117.0)|
| 0:51:59| And so that's tied to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3119.0)|
| 0:52:01| And then the other is tied to Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3121.0)|
| 0:52:04| which helped to increase their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3124.0)|
| 0:52:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3126.0)|
| 0:52:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3127.0)|
| 0:52:08| With the Personnel Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3128.0)|
| 0:52:09| since we've now taken over on the Government Law Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3129.0)|
| 0:52:18| what's included in the Government Law Library budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3138.0)|
| 0:52:21| And does it take into account what the Personnel Committee's changes have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3141.0)|
| 0:52:24| been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3144.0)|
| 0:52:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3145.0)|
| 0:52:26| That's a really good, cool question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3146.0)|
| 0:52:29| As we looked at the budget for Government Law Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3149.0)|
| 0:52:34| it was two months ago, three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3154.0)|
| 0:52:37| So it still includes the funding of a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3157.0)|
| 0:52:40| And so we know currently it's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3160.0)|
| 0:52:44| So that can go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3164.0)|
| 0:52:46| So as the Personnel Committee decides how to handle Government Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3166.0)|
| 0:52:50| Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3170.0)|
| 0:52:51| we can amend that budget to bring that budget down on the revenue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3171.0)|
| 0:52:55| expense side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3175.0)|
| 0:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3176.0)|
| 0:52:57| You were talking about the 8% raise for KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3177.0)|
| 0:53:03| That was Captain and Below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3183.0)|
| 0:53:05| And does that budget include the 8% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3185.0)|
| 0:53:11| even though the Sheriff declined to delete the vacant positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3191.0)|
| 0:53:16| the 58 positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3196.0)|
| 0:53:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3198.0)|
| 0:53:19| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3199.0)|
| 0:53:21| So what's in, so the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3201.0)|
| 0:53:23| so the Mayor Norwood County Commission by TCA code can take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3203.0)|
| 0:53:28| positions from, from the Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3208.0)|
| 0:53:33| And so the Sheriff did turn in a budget request asking for a 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3213.0)|
| 0:53:38| raise for Captain and Below, 10% raise for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3218.0)|
| 0:53:45| Chiefs and then 5% raise for, for civilians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3225.0)|
| 0:53:49| But in doing so, we also volunteered to delete 58 vacant positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3229.0)|
| 0:53:55| And so those positions are still on this budget and funded at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3235.0)|
| 0:54:01| level that it would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3241.0)|
| 0:54:02| The Mayor's thought to the Sheriff and proposal to the Sheriff was as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3242.0)|
| 0:54:08| you propose, we can delete those, those 58 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3248.0)|
| 0:54:11| So, but we budgeted as if they were still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3251.0)|
| 0:54:15| In those 58 positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3255.0)|
| 0:54:17| did he put in which positions that he was willing to get rid of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3257.0)|
| 0:54:21| I don't have the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3261.0)|
| 0:54:24| I can, I'm looking at Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3264.0)|
| 0:54:26| And so I think it was 50 corrections and eight patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3266.0)|
| 0:54:33| She's, that came from Bodie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3273.0)|
| 0:54:36| That's where the mind is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3276.0)|
| 0:54:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3280.0)|
| 0:54:43| Does the Sheriff have a maintenance of effort calculation like education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3283.0)|
| 0:54:50| Yes. So there, if I had my, my CTAS book, I would tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3290.0)|
| 0:54:54| there are three or four maintenance of effort calculations that we do every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3294.0)|
| 0:54:59| year. One is schools. One is Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3299.0)|
| 0:55:04| One is EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3304.0)|
| 0:55:09| There's at least three and they're all kinds of different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3309.0)|
| 0:55:16| The schools, as we've talked about is based off recurring revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3316.0)|
| 0:55:21| Sheriff's offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3321.0)|
| 0:55:25| I have to look to see what that's based off of, but there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3325.0)|
| 0:55:27| I know it's based off of positions and we have to turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3327.0)|
| 0:55:31| we have to turn the report annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3331.0)|
| 0:55:32| but there is a maintenance of effort calculation for the Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3332.0)|
| 0:55:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3336.0)|
| 0:55:37| And I was going to ask you what other MOE calculations do we abide by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3337.0)|
| 0:55:42| One for EPW for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3342.0)|
| 0:55:43| And it means that you can't decrease what your funding roads for every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3343.0)|
| 0:55:49| And the last question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3349.0)|
| 0:55:51| I noticed we're purchasing 47 vehicles for the Sheriff. Is this adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3351.0)|
| 0:55:57| I would defer to Alison on adequate. I think ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3357.0)|
| 0:56:01| I can't remember what the proposal was. I'll let Alison answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3361.0)|
| 0:56:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3379.0)|
| 0:56:33| Upon our initial proposal was around 60 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3393.0)|
| 0:56:38| Chris did allow, I believe it's 47 out of the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3398.0)|
| 0:56:43| And what we do is if we have surplus funds at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3403.0)|
| 0:56:47| then we come to commission and ask to use those surplus funds to buy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3407.0)|
| 0:56:51| difference of the vehicles that we were not budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3411.0)|
| 0:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3416.0)|
| 0:56:57| But the 47 vehicles could be used in excess funds in the Sheriff's budget of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3417.0)|
| 0:57:01| the $101 million we're giving him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3421.0)|
| 0:57:06| The surplus funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3426.0)|
| 0:57:07| like we use the surplus funds usually from vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3427.0)|
| 0:57:13| And so in August or September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3433.0)|
| 0:57:15| we'd come to commission and ask to designate those funds to buy capital needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3435.0)|
| 0:57:20| that were not budgeted in FY 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3440.0)|
| 0:57:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3442.0)|
| 0:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3443.0)|

| 0:57:48| I'm a newbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3468.0)|
| 0:57:49| This is the first budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3469.0)|
| 0:57:51| So ask my colleagues for some patience with some of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3471.0)|
| 0:57:55| On page 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3475.0)|
| 0:57:56| what is the trustees commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3476.0)|
| 0:58:03| Page 15 trustees commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3483.0)|
| 0:58:05| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3485.0)|
| 0:58:06| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3486.0)|
| 0:58:07| by TCA code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3487.0)|
| 0:58:08| the trustee can charge a fee for collections of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3488.0)|
| 0:58:11| And so we have to budget for our trustees commission in each fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3491.0)|
| 0:58:15| And so you will see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3495.0)|
| 0:58:17| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3497.0)|
| 0:58:18| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3498.0)|
| 0:58:19| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3499.0)|
| 0:58:20| expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3500.0)|
| 0:58:21| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3501.0)|
| 0:58:22| or code in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3502.0)|
| 0:58:23| in every fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3503.0)|
| 0:58:24| But basically it's paid to the trustee for bringing in revenue and overseeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3504.0)|
| 0:58:29| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3509.0)|
| 0:58:30| And then also on page 15 leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3510.0)|
| 0:58:32| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3512.0)|
| 0:58:33| what are those for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3513.0)|
| 0:58:34| And why aren't we budgeting for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3514.0)|
| 0:58:37| Leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3517.0)|
| 0:58:38| I would refer to as Perry Binshoff's nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3518.0)|
| 0:58:41| If you want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3521.0)|
| 0:58:42| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3522.0)|
| 0:58:43| it's an accounting standard that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3523.0)|
| 0:58:46| That was guys be 87.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3526.0)|

| 0:58:54| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3534.0)|
| 0:58:55| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3535.0)|
| 0:58:56| for those leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3536.0)|
| 0:58:57| We don't have to do the budget form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3537.0)|
| 0:58:58| It's actually just appears on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3538.0)|
| 0:59:00| on our financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3540.0)|

| 0:59:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3548.0)|
| 0:59:09| On page 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3549.0)|
| 0:59:10| also the behavioral health urgent care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3550.0)|
| 0:59:12| Does the city contribute to that or Knox County Sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3552.0)|
| 0:59:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3557.0)|
| 0:59:18| So behavioral health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3558.0)|
| 0:59:19| urgent care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3559.0)|
| 0:59:21| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3561.0)|
| 0:59:22| the funding is broken down to two thirds County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3562.0)|
| 0:59:26| one third city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3566.0)|
| 0:59:28| And so all of our funding that we pay for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3568.0)|
| 0:59:31| is in that work code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3571.0)|
| 0:59:34| And then moving on to page 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3574.0)|
| 0:59:35| what is non-departmental on page 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3575.0)|
| 0:59:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3579.0)|
| 0:59:40| Non-departmental are things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3580.0)|
| 0:59:42| that would come up through the year that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3582.0)|
| 0:59:45| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3585.0)|
| 0:59:46| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3586.0)|
| 0:59:47| aren't necessarily assigned to a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3587.0)|
| 0:59:50| What else goes into this or code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3590.0)|
| 0:59:52| And you'll notice that if it's negative for everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3592.0)|
| 0:59:54| it's positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3594.0)|
| 0:59:55| We put our negative allocation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3595.0)|
| 0:59:58| So not only ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3598.0)|
| 1:00:00| but the sheriff's departments are in there as well as to where we know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3600.0)|
| 1:00:03| we're not going to spend all of our salary and benefit budget throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3603.0)|
| 1:00:08| the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3608.0)|
| 1:00:09| So we have to hit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3609.0)|
| 1:00:10| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3610.0)|
| 1:00:11| that number every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3611.0)|
| 1:00:12| And so we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3612.0)|
| 1:00:13| we put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3613.0)|
| 1:00:14| And then also notice a significant increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3614.0)|
| 1:00:16| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3616.0)|
| 1:00:17| in the PBA management budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3617.0)|
| 1:00:19| Can you tell me a little bit why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3619.0)|
| 1:00:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3621.0)|
| 1:00:22| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3622.0)|
| 1:00:23| so you will see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3623.0)|
| 1:00:24| that increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3624.0)|
| 1:00:25| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3625.0)|
| 1:00:26| from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3626.0)|
| 1:00:27| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3627.0)|
| 1:00:28| to 9.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3628.0)|
| 1:00:29| I should clarify first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3629.0)|
| 1:00:30| This is just not for PBA management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3630.0)|
| 1:00:33| This,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3633.0)|
| 1:00:34| this is a number where we normally used to charge departments for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3634.0)|
| 1:00:39| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3639.0)|
| 1:00:40| their building operation costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3640.0)|
| 1:00:41| whether it's utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3641.0)|
| 1:00:42| water maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3642.0)|
| 1:00:44| or building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3644.0)|
| 1:00:45| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3645.0)|
| 1:00:46| maintenance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3646.0)|
| 1:00:47| And it gets transferred over to our internal service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3647.0)|
| 1:00:50| which is building operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3650.0)|
| 1:00:52| Ultimately the last couple of the last three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3652.0)|
| 1:00:55| we have not increased this line item to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3655.0)|
| 1:00:58| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3658.0)|
| 1:00:59| as we have saw increases in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3659.0)|
| 1:01:01| in the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3661.0)|
| 1:01:02| Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3662.0)|
| 1:01:03| we have focused on increases for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3663.0)|
| 1:01:06| And so this is an attempt to get that back to where it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3666.0)|
| 1:01:09| because last year to end the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3669.0)|
| 1:01:11| we had to do a $3 million transfer to help make that fund whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3671.0)|
| 1:01:16| I also see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3676.0)|
| 1:01:17| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3677.0)|
| 1:01:18| there's increases in county IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3678.0)|
| 1:01:20| Can you tell us a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3680.0)|
| 1:01:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3682.0)|
| 1:01:23| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3683.0)|
| 1:01:24| so there are two numbers in county IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3684.0)|
| 1:01:27| One is just their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3687.0)|
| 1:01:28| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3688.0)|
| 1:01:29| their operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3689.0)|
| 1:01:30| which is 79,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3690.0)|
| 1:01:31| 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3691.0)|
| 1:01:32| And that increased from about six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3692.0)|
| 1:01:33| five to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3693.0)|
| 1:01:34| to 7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3694.0)|
| 1:01:35| A lot of that would be the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3695.0)|
| 1:01:36| the 3% raise for county employees are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3696.0)|
| 1:01:39| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3699.0)|
| 1:01:40| they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3700.0)|
| 1:01:41| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3701.0)|
| 1:01:42| like most departments are 70 to 80% of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3702.0)|
| 1:01:44| of their budget is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3704.0)|
| 1:01:45| is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3705.0)|
| 1:01:46| is related to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3706.0)|
| 1:01:47| And so that's where a lot of that comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3707.0)|
| 1:01:49| And you'll see also in county IT software and hardware and two lines below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3709.0)|
| 1:01:53| they increased by about 500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3713.0)|
| 1:01:55| That's just related to contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3715.0)|
| 1:01:57| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3717.0)|
| 1:01:58| that other departments have with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3718.0)|
| 1:02:00| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3720.0)|
| 1:02:01| with county IT for software and potential hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3721.0)|
| 1:02:04| And then does the engineering and public works budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3724.0)|
| 1:02:07| does it include state aid money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3727.0)|
| 1:02:09| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3729.0)|
| 1:02:10| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3730.0)|
| 1:02:11| state aid is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3731.0)|
| 1:02:12| And state aid has put a smile on Jim's face this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3732.0)|
| 1:02:15| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3735.0)|
| 1:02:16| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3736.0)|
| 1:02:17| state aid this year was about 8.1 million total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3737.0)|
| 1:02:22| And so we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3742.0)|
| 1:02:23| we put that in fund 171 and it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3743.0)|
| 1:02:26| is that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3746.0)|
| 1:02:27| Bodie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3747.0)|
| 1:02:28| It's in 171 and we budgeted it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3748.0)|
| 1:02:30| So the only thing that's in engineering and public works from that standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3750.0)|
| 1:02:34| is the amount for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3754.0)|
| 1:02:36| for paving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3756.0)|
| 1:02:37| which is not state aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3757.0)|
| 1:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3759.0)|
| 1:02:40| And then can you explain just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3760.0)|
| 1:02:41| the six and a half million decrease in the debt service revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3761.0)|
| 1:02:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3765.0)|
| 1:02:46| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3766.0)|
| 1:02:47| the best way to explain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3767.0)|
| 1:02:49| I feel like a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3769.0)|
| 1:02:50| If you've got your book turned to page 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3770.0)|
| 1:02:52| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3772.0)|
| 1:02:53| is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3773.0)|
| 1:02:54| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3774.0)|
| 1:02:55| down as under the debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3775.0)|
| 1:02:57| you will see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3777.0)|
| 1:02:59| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3779.0)|
| 1:03:00| a payment from general purpose school fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3780.0)|
| 1:03:02| And you'll see that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3782.0)|
| 1:03:03| that proposed number in 24 is $9,071,724.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3783.0)|
| 1:03:09| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3789.0)|
| 1:03:10| before we moved the pennies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3790.0)|
| 1:03:11| that number was like 16,000,685,724.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3791.0)|
| 1:03:15| But after we moved the four pennies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3795.0)|
| 1:03:17| that payment went down and revenues in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3797.0)|
| 1:03:20| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3800.0)|
| 1:03:21| and county property tax revenue in debt service went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3801.0)|
| 1:03:26| And so that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3806.0)|
| 1:03:27| that's the offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3807.0)|
| 1:03:28| And then page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3808.0)|
| 1:03:30| let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3810.0)|
| 1:03:31| 33,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3811.0)|
| 1:03:32| just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3812.0)|
| 1:03:33| especially those who are watching capital outlay projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3813.0)|
| 1:03:39| Does each department pay for those or do we pay for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3819.0)|
| 1:03:43| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3823.0)|
| 1:03:44| so what we do is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3824.0)|
| 1:03:46| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3826.0)|
| 1:03:47| each department makes a request for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3827.0)|
| 1:03:49| for capital outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3829.0)|
| 1:03:51| We fund those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3831.0)|
| 1:03:52| We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3832.0)|
| 1:03:53| in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3833.0)|
| 1:03:54| we have funded those through a capital outlay note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3834.0)|
| 1:03:56| And we pay for that through our debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3836.0)|
| 1:03:59| Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3839.0)|
| 1:04:00| the last few years though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3840.0)|
| 1:04:01| we have just rolled that into our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3841.0)|
| 1:04:04| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3844.0)|
| 1:04:05| our bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3845.0)|
| 1:04:06| And we front load the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3846.0)|
| 1:04:07| the bond issue to pay for this over three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3847.0)|
| 1:04:10| And so no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3850.0)|
| 1:04:12| the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3852.0)|
| 1:04:13| the departments that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3853.0)|
| 1:04:14| are listed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3854.0)|
| 1:04:15| don't have an expense in their budgets that pays for capital outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3855.0)|
| 1:04:19| We just pay for it through county debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3859.0)|
| 1:04:22| And then last question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3862.0)|
| 1:04:24| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3864.0)|
| 1:04:25| on page 34,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3865.0)|
| 1:04:26| Knoxville chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3866.0)|
| 1:04:27| just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3867.0)|
| 1:04:28| I've had a couple of constituent questions about our funding to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3868.0)|
| 1:04:32| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3872.0)|
| 1:04:33| just explain to anyone who's watching too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3873.0)|
| 1:04:35| that they now play a much bigger role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3875.0)|
| 1:04:38| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3878.0)|

| 1:04:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3882.0)|
| 1:04:43| A couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3883.0)|
| 1:04:44| you would have saw the chamber on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3884.0)|
| 1:04:46| on here at a lesser amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3886.0)|
| 1:04:47| And then a separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3887.0)|
| 1:04:48| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3888.0)|
| 1:04:49| organization called the development corporation was on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3889.0)|
| 1:04:52| which is the county's economic development arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3892.0)|
| 1:04:55| And it would have been funded at about $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3895.0)|
| 1:04:58| I think it was about eight or eight 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3898.0)|
| 1:05:00| That seems about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3900.0)|
| 1:05:01| And so ultimately the mayor's plural county mayor and city mayor met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3901.0)|
| 1:05:07| commissioner of ECD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3907.0)|
| 1:05:09| And we changed our structure as it relates to ECD to flow everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3909.0)|
| 1:05:13| underneath the Knoxville chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3913.0)|
| 1:05:16| And so that number is larger now in one organization because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3916.0)|
| 1:05:21| encompasses a lot more than just what you think of a chamber function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3921.0)|
| 1:05:25| They're also now at acting as our economic development arm for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3925.0)|
| 1:05:30| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3930.0)|
| 1:05:31| I think you all have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3931.0)|
| 1:05:33| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3933.0)|
| 1:05:34| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3934.0)|
| 1:05:35| educational series coming up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3935.0)|

| 1:05:41| And, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3941.0)|
| 1:05:42| they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3942.0)|

| 1:05:46| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3946.0)|
| 1:05:47| recently went on a exploratory trip to Raleigh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3947.0)|

| 1:05:58| And I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3958.0)|
| 1:05:59| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3959.0)|

| 1:06:33| So I try to get most of my questions done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3993.0)|
| 1:06:35| but one that I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3995.0)|
| 1:06:36| one that I didn't really have because we didn't talk about in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=3996.0)|

| 1:06:45| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4005.0)|
| 1:06:46| homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4006.0)|
| 1:06:47| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4007.0)|
| 1:06:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4008.0)|

| 1:06:52| And what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4012.0)|
| 1:06:53| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4013.0)|

| 1:06:58| what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4018.0)|
| 1:06:59| what's the goal there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4019.0)|
| 1:07:00| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4020.0)|

| 1:07:02| so I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4022.0)|
| 1:07:03| you would defer to miss Jenny Holden on details as far as what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4023.0)|
| 1:07:08| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4028.0)|
| 1:07:09| that office does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4029.0)|
| 1:07:10| but on page 17 under office of housing stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4030.0)|
| 1:07:14| it's about two thirds of the way down the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4034.0)|
| 1:07:17| The org code is one Oh one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4037.0)|

| 1:07:21| five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4041.0)|
| 1:07:22| I say that because they're in numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4042.0)|
| 1:07:23| So you can find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4043.0)|
| 1:07:24| And you'll see that from the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4044.0)|
| 1:07:25| we're putting in 340,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4045.0)|
| 1:07:27| I think there's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4047.0)|
| 1:07:28| some grant funding going into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4048.0)|
| 1:07:29| She can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4049.0)|
| 1:07:30| And if you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4050.0)|
| 1:07:31| I'll let her speak about that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4051.0)|
| 1:07:44| That is our new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4064.0)|
| 1:07:45| It's the joint initiative with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4065.0)|
| 1:07:48| We are jointly funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4068.0)|
| 1:07:49| We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4069.0)|
| 1:07:50| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4070.0)|
| 1:07:51| we'll also be using our grant funds to support the office in hopes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4071.0)|
| 1:07:55| having a better coordinated approach on not just the response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4075.0)|
| 1:07:59| homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4079.0)|
| 1:08:00| but also the prevention of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4080.0)|
| 1:08:02| We'll have some additional rental assistance funds that we can use for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4082.0)|
| 1:08:06| eviction prevention programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4086.0)|
| 1:08:08| What our hope is in the end is to try and keep people housed where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4088.0)|
| 1:08:11| are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4091.0)|
| 1:08:12| so that we don't continue to see the increasing number of homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4092.0)|
| 1:08:15| that we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4095.0)|
| 1:08:17| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4097.0)|
| 1:08:18| we have our new executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4098.0)|
| 1:08:20| Aaron Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4100.0)|
| 1:08:21| and more information about that will be coming before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4101.0)|
| 1:08:24| We are hoping to have an interlocal agreement between the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4104.0)|
| 1:08:27| county come before commission in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4107.0)|
| 1:08:30| maybe July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4110.0)|
| 1:08:31| but we're hoping for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4111.0)|
| 1:08:32| for the June commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4112.0)|
| 1:08:34| What percentage is grants and what percentage is taxpayer money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4114.0)|
| 1:08:37| So at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4117.0)|

| 1:09:22| So this is more on the service side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4162.0)|
| 1:09:24| The city will continue to do those projects that are construction based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4164.0)|
| 1:09:27| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4167.0)|

| 1:09:30| we have a lot of nonprofits that are doing great work in this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4170.0)|
| 1:09:33| but what you have sometimes are the same nonprofits doing the same work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4173.0)|
| 1:09:37| And then you have one person that has three case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4177.0)|
| 1:09:42| What we are hoping to do with this office is have a coordinated approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4182.0)|
| 1:09:45| so that there's a single entity that's working with all the nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4185.0)|

| 1:10:45| tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4245.0)|
| 1:10:49| You're on page 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4249.0)|

| 1:10:52| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4252.0)|
| 1:10:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4253.0)|
| 1:10:54| 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4254.0)|
| 1:10:55| The amount that we budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4255.0)|
| 1:10:56| for minerals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4256.0)|
| 1:10:57| set severance tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4257.0)|
| 1:11:00| We only budgeted 200,000 because that was based on what we had this far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4260.0)|
| 1:11:05| We did get a larger payment in this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4265.0)|
| 1:11:08| I think it was this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4268.0)|
| 1:11:09| And so that's one number that we may come back to you all and amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4269.0)|
| 1:11:13| throughout the year once we get some more historical data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4273.0)|
| 1:11:16| But this budget includes 200,000 for mineral severance tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4276.0)|
| 1:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4281.0)|
| 1:11:22| And over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4282.0)|
| 1:11:23| you tried to make this document very easy for governmental employees to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4283.0)|
| 1:11:30| read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4290.0)|
| 1:11:31| as well as citizens who happen to go online under the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4291.0)|
| 1:11:35| and look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4295.0)|
| 1:11:37| But I get questions every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4297.0)|
| 1:11:39| And page 28 on the budgeted position count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4299.0)|
| 1:11:44| the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4304.0)|
| 1:11:45| when they go through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4305.0)|
| 1:11:46| it looks like we have no employees in the retirement office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4306.0)|
| 1:11:50| no employees in ADA office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4310.0)|
| 1:11:54| no employees of the probation office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4314.0)|
| 1:11:57| no employees of the department of community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4317.0)|
| 1:11:59| community services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4319.0)|
| 1:12:00| community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4320.0)|
| 1:12:03| In the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4323.0)|
| 1:12:04| it looks like we have no detectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4324.0)|
| 1:12:06| no forensics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4326.0)|
| 1:12:07| no narcotics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4327.0)|
| 1:12:08| no internal affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4328.0)|
| 1:12:10| no anybody that works in the detention facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4330.0)|
| 1:12:14| If the directors of these different departments are not going to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4334.0)|
| 1:12:18| this data to put in this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4338.0)|
| 1:12:20| why are we continuing to put zero employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4340.0)|
| 1:12:24| And this goes back now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4344.0)|
| 1:12:26| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4346.0)|
| 1:12:27| I even went back three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4347.0)|
| 1:12:28| So let's take a few of those one at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4348.0)|
| 1:12:31| if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4351.0)|
| 1:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4352.0)|
| 1:12:34| Like retirement office is in here because there's an or code in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4354.0)|
| 1:12:38| And we just continue to put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4358.0)|
| 1:12:40| Technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4360.0)|
| 1:12:41| the retirement office is separate from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4361.0)|
| 1:12:43| So that's why there's no employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4363.0)|
| 1:12:47| ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4367.0)|
| 1:12:48| we do it separate in its own fund now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4368.0)|
| 1:12:51| but that's an old or code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4371.0)|
| 1:12:52| We could clean some of these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4372.0)|
| 1:12:54| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4374.0)|
| 1:12:55| and the same thing with community services and community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4375.0)|
| 1:12:58| Those are now in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4378.0)|
| 1:13:01| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4381.0)|
| 1:13:02| in the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4382.0)|
| 1:13:03| which was abolished prior to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4383.0)|
| 1:13:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4385.0)|
| 1:13:06| We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4386.0)|
| 1:13:07| so this is something that we could clean up going to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4387.0)|
| 1:13:09| the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4389.0)|
| 1:13:10| What about the one above it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4390.0)|
| 1:13:12| Probation probation is somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4392.0)|
| 1:13:14| It says no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4394.0)|
| 1:13:15| no employees in probation office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4395.0)|
| 1:13:20| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4400.0)|
| 1:13:21| it got moved under the court administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4401.0)|
| 1:13:23| which is Richard major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4403.0)|
| 1:13:25| And actually on the page 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4405.0)|
| 1:13:27| there's shows no employees for animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4407.0)|
| 1:13:31| Or building codes or code enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4411.0)|
| 1:13:34| So the reason anything that's dealing with the sheriff's office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4414.0)|
| 1:13:38| allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4418.0)|
| 1:13:39| Alison can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4419.0)|
| 1:13:40| they budget every position in patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4420.0)|
| 1:13:43| And so they don't break it out between or codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4423.0)|
| 1:13:46| And so we still need the work codes to appear on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4426.0)|
| 1:13:50| Because obviously you see what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4430.0)|
| 1:13:52| If it shows that these are County positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4432.0)|
| 1:13:55| we don't have anybody in those slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4435.0)|
| 1:13:58| It looks a little odd for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4438.0)|
| 1:14:00| When you say you have no internal affairs or nobody in the juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4440.0)|
| 1:14:04| division or nobody for DUI litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4444.0)|
| 1:14:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4447.0)|
| 1:14:08| What we can do is we can check with GFO way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4448.0)|
| 1:14:11| Ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4451.0)|
| 1:14:12| what that is doing is it's reconciling this back to the expenditure one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4452.0)|
| 1:14:16| which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4456.0)|
| 1:14:17| which starts the book and it keeps it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4457.0)|
| 1:14:19| So you're going to see what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4459.0)|
| 1:14:21| If GFOA does not have any issues with us taking those out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4461.0)|
| 1:14:24| then we can easily take them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4464.0)|
| 1:14:26| And then on 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4466.0)|
| 1:14:27| it says there's no code enforcement or building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4467.0)|
| 1:14:31| Those are in one 31 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4471.0)|
| 1:14:33| So we moved those to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4473.0)|
| 1:14:35| So it just makes it a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4475.0)|
| 1:14:37| I think when people are going through there and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4477.0)|
| 1:14:39| wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4479.0)|
| 1:14:40| how come as long as GFOA doesn't have an issue with us hiding zeros,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4480.0)|
| 1:14:45| we can hide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4485.0)|
| 1:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4486.0)|
| 1:14:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4488.0)|
| 1:14:51| Commissioner Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4491.0)|
| 1:14:52| your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4492.0)|
| 1:14:53| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4493.0)|
| 1:14:54| madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4494.0)|
| 1:14:56| Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4496.0)|
| 1:14:57| could you explain the visit Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4497.0)|
| 1:15:02| Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4502.0)|
| 1:15:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4503.0)|
| 1:15:08| If you lean on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4508.0)|
| 1:15:09| it'll meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4509.0)|
| 1:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4510.0)|
| 1:15:12| Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4512.0)|
| 1:15:13| can you explain the $4.2 million for visit Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4513.0)|
| 1:15:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4517.0)|
| 1:15:18| Get to that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4518.0)|
| 1:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4524.0)|
| 1:15:26| So everything on page 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4526.0)|
| 1:15:28| which is related to the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4528.0)|
| 1:15:30| motel tax fund is revenue that comes in from the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4530.0)|
| 1:15:35| motel tax fund and must be spent as it relates to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4535.0)|
| 1:15:40| And so visit Knoxville's piece is probably the easiest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4540.0)|
| 1:15:44| That's our mechanism that we use to to support the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4544.0)|
| 1:15:55| the promotion of tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4555.0)|
| 1:15:57| And so by TCA code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4557.0)|
| 1:15:59| they get 40% of hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4559.0)|
| 1:16:02| So 40% of 10.5 is 4.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4562.0)|
| 1:16:06| So we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4566.0)|
| 1:16:08| so they get that 4.2 million based off the breakout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4568.0)|
| 1:16:12| So technically it's 40% for the direct promotion of tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4572.0)|
| 1:16:17| which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4577.0)|
| 1:16:18| which they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4578.0)|
| 1:16:20| That's our arm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4580.0)|
| 1:16:24| 40% for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4584.0)|
| 1:16:26| for facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4586.0)|
| 1:16:28| for the use of facilities or the payment of debt on facilities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4588.0)|
| 1:16:33| tourism based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4593.0)|
| 1:16:34| And so a lot of our expense on that goes to the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4594.0)|
| 1:16:38| which is 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4598.0)|
| 1:16:39| Then we also pay about 1.2 or 3 million to the agency history center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4599.0)|
| 1:16:45| which is our facility that uses that we use to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4605.0)|
| 1:16:48| to cover those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4608.0)|
| 1:16:51| 10% goes to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4611.0)|
| 1:16:53| So they can utilize that for tourism related expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4613.0)|
| 1:16:58| And then we keep 10% for the same thing that the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4618.0)|
| 1:17:02| And so when you see money's related to whether it's arts and cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4622.0)|
| 1:17:08| alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4628.0)|
| 1:17:09| Beck center or the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4629.0)|
| 1:17:10| a lot of that's in our 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4630.0)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4636.0)|
| 1:17:20| Madam chair, may I have permission to call the attorney general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4640.0)|
| 1:17:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4644.0)|
| 1:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4645.0)|
| 1:17:26| I could call charm Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4646.0)|
| 1:17:44| My question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4664.0)|
| 1:17:47| General Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4667.0)|
| 1:17:49| And I think I've already talked to you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4669.0)|
| 1:17:51| There was an increase in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4671.0)|
| 1:17:52| And from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4672.0)|
| 1:17:54| that was four or 5% salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4674.0)|
| 1:17:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4677.0)|
| 1:17:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4678.0)|
| 1:17:59| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4679.0)|
| 1:18:00| The main increase in our budget is that we have County assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4680.0)|
| 1:18:05| district attorneys and three County investigators that are paid for by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4685.0)|
| 1:18:10| County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4690.0)|
| 1:18:11| but they are state employees by statute because they work in a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4691.0)|
| 1:18:16| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4696.0)|
| 1:18:17| And there was a Senate bill that was passed this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4697.0)|
| 1:18:21| Senate bill and house bill that was passed by the legislature that gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4701.0)|
| 1:18:25| the assistant district attorneys and the investigators a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4705.0)|
| 1:18:29| That raise is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4709.0)|
| 1:18:31| as applied to all state employees that are assistant DAs or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4711.0)|
| 1:18:36| investigators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4716.0)|
| 1:18:37| no matter what the funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4717.0)|
| 1:18:39| So that raise went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4719.0)|
| 1:18:41| And that's the big increase in the County budget is that the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4721.0)|
| 1:18:44| passed a state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4724.0)|
| 1:18:45| increasing the actual salary for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4725.0)|
| 1:18:49| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4729.0)|
| 1:18:50| because we were a state office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4730.0)|
| 1:18:51| my state employees have to be raised at the amount that state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4731.0)|
| 1:18:56| government officials have and for cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4736.0)|
| 1:18:59| And so the governor right now has said he is giving a 5% cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4739.0)|
| 1:19:05| living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4745.0)|
| 1:19:06| So all state employees in my office get the 5% cost of living as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4746.0)|
| 1:19:11| opposed to my County employees who would get what the mayor decides is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4751.0)|
| 1:19:16| their cost of living increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4756.0)|
| 1:19:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4758.0)|
| 1:19:19| I just wanted to clarify that and I didn't want to answer for general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4759.0)|
| 1:19:22| Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4762.0)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4763.0)|

| 1:19:41| Can't find it in here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4781.0)|
| 1:19:42| but a blunt partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4782.0)|
| 1:19:44| $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4784.0)|
| 1:19:47| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4787.0)|
| 1:19:49| I know it's the partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4789.0)|
| 1:19:50| They're a member of pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4790.0)|
| 1:19:51| Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4791.0)|
| 1:19:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4792.0)|
| 1:19:53| I heard there's some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4793.0)|
| 1:19:54| Ultimately I'm trying to find that page too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4794.0)|
| 1:19:56| So I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4796.0)|
| 1:19:57| it's probably on page 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4797.0)|
| 1:20:00| What that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4800.0)|
| 1:20:01| is we are a quarter owner in Pellissippi place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4801.0)|
| 1:20:05| the technology park at the end of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4805.0)|
| 1:20:09| And so it's us Blunt County city of Maribel and city of Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4809.0)|
| 1:20:13| And that 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4813.0)|
| 1:20:14| we put $30,000 each into it every year for the maintenance of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4814.0)|
| 1:20:18| of that technology part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4818.0)|
| 1:20:21| Have you heard of any issues of buildings being built in the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4821.0)|
| 1:20:25| place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4825.0)|
| 1:20:26| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4826.0)|
| 1:20:27| the mayor sets on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4827.0)|
| 1:20:29| The last thing that they had talked about was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4829.0)|
| 1:20:35| looking to do some residential in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4835.0)|
| 1:20:38| So I'll try to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4838.0)|
| 1:20:41| There was an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4841.0)|
| 1:20:43| I spoke with Ron France,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4843.0)|
| 1:20:44| chairman of the Blunt County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4844.0)|
| 1:20:47| So let me follow up on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4847.0)|
| 1:20:49| I just want to know if you do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4849.0)|
| 1:20:50| I know one issue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4850.0)|
| 1:20:52| that we have encountered was the state at one point said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4852.0)|
| 1:20:57| Pellissippi Parkway was going to go straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4857.0)|
| 1:20:59| And now it's not going to go straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4859.0)|
| 1:21:01| It's going to curve and come into the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4861.0)|
| 1:21:03| And we had a lot of meetings on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4863.0)|
| 1:21:05| trying to get the state to go straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4865.0)|
| 1:21:08| Cause that's what they said they were going to do instead of curve in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4868.0)|
| 1:21:10| and back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4870.0)|
| 1:21:12| And because the state was going to have to pay us about 30 million bucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4872.0)|
| 1:21:15| to real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4875.0)|
| 1:21:16| to real relocate utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4876.0)|
| 1:21:18| And I don't know what the state ever decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4878.0)|
| 1:21:22| That's that's it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4882.0)|
| 1:21:24| Ultimately there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4884.0)|
| 1:21:26| there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4886.0)|
| 1:21:27| and this goes back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4887.0)|
| 1:21:30| this is six or seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4890.0)|
| 1:21:32| And we try to get them to change what ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4892.0)|
| 1:21:36| if you ever want to get into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4896.0)|
| 1:21:37| there was a retention pond in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4897.0)|
| 1:21:40| And we think somebody at the state thought it was manmade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4900.0)|
| 1:21:43| And this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4903.0)|
| 1:21:44| you had to go around it and said you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4904.0)|
| 1:21:45| you didn't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4905.0)|
| 1:21:46| you could go straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4906.0)|
| 1:21:47| And so we're going to have to redesign the whole park because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4907.0)|
| 1:21:50| So probably what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4910.0)|
| 1:21:52| Is that partnership really paying off for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4912.0)|
| 1:21:55| I think ultimately it's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4915.0)|
| 1:21:59| If I think once Pellissippi Parkway extension happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4919.0)|
| 1:22:03| and then that park gets to fill out and you have residential in there and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4923.0)|
| 1:22:06| have more businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4926.0)|
| 1:22:09| then we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4929.0)|
| 1:22:10| we get 25% of property tax from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4930.0)|
| 1:22:13| that that that will pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4933.0)|
| 1:22:15| So I think over time it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4935.0)|
| 1:22:18| I think one of the big issues that we've had early on is it was built and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4938.0)|
| 1:22:22| opened right at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4942.0)|
| 1:22:23| at right at the beginning of the great recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4943.0)|
| 1:22:26| So getting anything to go was hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4946.0)|
| 1:22:28| And then not knowing what the state was going to do with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4948.0)|
| 1:22:30| with Pellissippi Parkway has been a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4950.0)|
| 1:22:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4953.0)|
| 1:22:34| And I think Knox County paid way many millions more than what county did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4954.0)|
| 1:22:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4960.0)|
| 1:22:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4961.0)|
| 1:22:42| It was split evenly four ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4962.0)|
| 1:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4963.0)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4964.0)|

| 1:22:49| I love to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4969.0)|
| 1:22:52| Shout out to my school board chair and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4972.0)|
| 1:22:57| Risewick and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4977.0)|
| 1:22:59| We got a South Knoxville solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4979.0)|
| 1:23:01| The only problem about that one is it's in 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4981.0)|
| 1:23:05| We need to get that one moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4985.0)|
| 1:23:06| We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4986.0)|
| 1:23:07| for South Knoxville growing and new hopefuls overcrowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4987.0)|
| 1:23:12| no more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4992.0)|
| 1:23:13| we have no more room for no kids at new Hopewell and everything is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4993.0)|
| 1:23:17| everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4997.0)|
| 1:23:18| but 80% of everything being built out there is zoned for new hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=4998.0)|
| 1:23:22| So I appreciate the mayor and you and school setting down and come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5002.0)|
| 1:23:28| the solution that whatever this solution is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5008.0)|
| 1:23:32| but I think we need it sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5012.0)|
| 1:23:35| Just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5015.0)|
| 1:23:36| I want to give you a shout out and I might take the mayor and the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5016.0)|
| 1:23:38| for realizing that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5018.0)|
| 1:23:42| we've always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5022.0)|
| 1:23:45| we had been known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5025.0)|
| 1:23:46| I hate this word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5026.0)|
| 1:23:47| Redheaded stepchild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5027.0)|
| 1:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5029.0)|
| 1:23:50| But that's because we weren't growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5030.0)|
| 1:23:52| Now we're growing and Carson wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5032.0)|
| 1:23:54| wants to see some stuff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5034.0)|
| 1:23:57| So what I would say to use this five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5037.0)|
| 1:24:00| all we're approving is year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5040.0)|
| 1:24:02| I am sure next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5042.0)|
| 1:24:04| as we look at a new five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5044.0)|
| 1:24:05| this is something that the superintendent and the mayor will discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5045.0)|
| 1:24:08| And things are always kind of a fluid in a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5048.0)|
| 1:24:16| If I may also going back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5056.0)|
| 1:24:19| to what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5059.0)|
| 1:24:20| what commissioner Lee talked to the DA about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5060.0)|
| 1:24:25| if you see a big increase in the public defender or code as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5065.0)|
| 1:24:29| it's tied to the AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5069.0)|
| 1:24:30| I know that she knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5070.0)|
| 1:24:31| but ultimately 75% of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5071.0)|
| 1:24:34| that the age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5074.0)|
| 1:24:36| excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-public-hearing-230515?start=5076.0)|
