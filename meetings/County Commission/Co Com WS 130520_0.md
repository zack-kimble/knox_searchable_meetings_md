| 0:08:09| David and Becky were friends of mine from the very beginning of my tenure on county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| As a matter of fact, my first out-of-this-room commitment to being a commissioner was doing their wedding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| And so it was an honor to perform their wedding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| And it was an honor to see, you know, through the thick and thin of their marriage and through his sickness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| Becky really stood by him and honored the vows that she took, I believe it was on Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=512)|
| 0:08:41| And so she honored those vows and David did also through sickness and in health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| So, Becky, thank you on behalf of Knox County and thank you for David's service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=526)|
| 0:08:56| I'd just like to say thank you to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=536)|

| 0:09:06| and a very, very big part of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| And he lived and breathed it just like he did his own family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| And keep in mind and keep in your prayers all these officers back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| and all the ones that aren't with us today because they all work so hard to keep us where we can be safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=562)|

| 0:12:26| Let's have questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Questions for Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Not necessarily so much in the line of questions, but I do want some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| It was indeed a privilege and honor for me as a citizen of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| to attend the graduation services of Carter High School, Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| and then the Kelley Academy, not at the mall, but in the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=767)|
| 0:12:55| And I think it's their largest graduating class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Is that correct, Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| It was a graduating class for the Kelley Volunteer Academy of 106 graduates this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| And they do not graduate just once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| so they have trouble making big numbers because I think they actually graduate, like, three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| The reason that I wanted to discuss this for just a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| or give you the opportunity to maybe make sure I'm correct in what I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| because I have always supported school in the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| there are story after story coming out of the graduates of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| now possessing a state of Tennessee, Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| diplomas for graduating high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| It allows kids that would be sitting beside the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| Those are my terms or my words, not other people's words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| It allows a kid that may be sitting beside the road somewhere to get a high school diploma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| and to really have the doors flung, again, my word, wide open to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| as in one graduate a year ago, I guess, being offered a full scholarship four years at Maryville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=848)|
| 0:14:17| So there are lots of just bone-chilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| or goose-bump-raising stories that come out of the relatively few number of young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=864)|
| 0:14:33| that need a little bit different in the line of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| So what I think we're seeing before us right now is an expansion of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| in conjunction with the Simon Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| There is an expansion of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| This item is not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| This item is around our adult education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| This is going to be at the mall, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| And I will refer to it as school at the mall, only it's a program directed at adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| a program that we've had for a long time or the school system has provided for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| but it's in a new setting and maybe what I'll refer to as a more vibrant setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| and that it's easy to get in and out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| It's a place where people can come and go and the students can get their diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=920)|
| 0:15:32| just make advances in their educational status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| So now that's what I had to say about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| and I wanted to make sure that if there was anything to add that you added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Jim McIntyre, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| This is the item on your agenda is for a change to adult education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| and we've had, as Commissioner said, a pretty vibrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| and successful adult education program for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| It has been headquartered at the historic Knoxville High School building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| and as we are moving toward surplusing that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| and moving toward having the community repurpose that building for its best use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| we've been looking at opportunities to house that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| What happened is the state of Tennessee made a fairly significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| in its structure for adult education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| which means that Knox County schools will be really a larger provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| of adult education services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| and our student population will probably somewhere close to double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| in terms of the number of students that will be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| At the same time, the state also allowed for a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| so that the dollars that are associated with that program can be used for lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| or rental of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Indeed, the Knoxville Center Mall is a great location for adult education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| We think this is a great space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| It's very accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| It's very centrally located to where most of the folks who access adult education reside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| and is also accessible by public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| We think this is an all-around win for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| It will be located right across the corridor from the Kelly Volunteer Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| which indeed is also expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| and has been truly an extraordinary opportunity for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| We believe very strongly, as I know all of you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| in multiple options for success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| multiple pathways for our students to access academic success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and the Kelly Volunteer Academy has really been the embodiment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| When you saw, I went to 14 high school graduations this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| and that was probably the most emotional and enthusiastic of all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| because it was, you know, for some of those kids, it was a pretty bumpy road to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| So it's a wonderful success, and we're delighted about its continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| I thought there for a moment that a school board member, India Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and I would be the ones that were going to bless them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| but I know you were coming from you were in the midst of two graduations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| so that was a very vocal crowd and a very excited graduating class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| Again, Mr. Chairman, I am appreciative that I was able to attend those three graduations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| on behalf of Knox County, and then I'd like to make sort of an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I'll do this two or three more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Gibbs High School is having its 100th anniversary this Friday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| and I am assured that Dr. McIntyre and Mayor Burchett will both be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| And everyone else is invited that would like to come to Gibbs High School this coming Friday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| 530 to 730 with the program at 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1129)|

| 0:18:56| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre and Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Item number 12, resolution 204 is approving a fund balance designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| general purpose school fund in the amount of $11,430,000 for textbooks, technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| maintenance and matching grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I have a question or two about this, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| One, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Just for the record, this is non-reoccurring funds, so it will not be part of the MOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| It is a fund balance designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| There was usually this type of request comes a little later in the year, usually in August or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| Just curious about why we're doing it now rather than late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| You know, I think part of it was really thinking about the technology aspect of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| and making sure that there are some aspects of the technology fund balance designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| that I think are imperative and fairly time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| And so we wanted to be able to have this designation in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| and as soon as we know that those funds are available to be able to begin to do some spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| The one-to-one instructional technology initiative, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| and also some of this what we call readiness for the new park assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| I think are two aspects of it that we'd like to be able to move forward on as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| So this allows us to be ready as soon as those funds are available to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I had just left my light on, but since we've got this subject before us, I'm in favor of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1247)|
| 0:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Now we're on page seven, item number 26, resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| It's to estimate and appropriate funds for the sale of county property from the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| to the capital improvement fund for the Carter Elementary Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| The amount of the appropriation is $5,275,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and it's from the funds received from the sale of the Hillcrest facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| Hopefully this will be the last time that I'll speak on this particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| and I know that several people are probably happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| But it would be a disservice if I didn't say that sometimes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1313)|
| 0:22:02| you can do wrong in doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| We're going to have a great facility for the youth in the Carter community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| The building's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| It's going to be a facility that will hopefully, you know, stand the test of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| and all kinds of great leaders and community-minded folks will get their start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| But this process was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| This process, I will say, set us back in terms of our relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| So sometimes we've got to look at the bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| And I guess my point is let's not do it this way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Let's let the processes drive the outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| and not inject ourselves in a way that was at best inappropriate and, you know, inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1372)|
| 0:23:09| So I'm going to vote in favor of this, believe it or not, because the die has been cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1389)|
| 0:23:20| But this is not the way we fund facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| This is not the way we build a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| I don't feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| This is my, I would say, informed, but it is my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| When the folks were building the Hillcrest facility, they built our predecessors, our forefathers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| the folks who were standing on their shoulders, they did not build it for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| They built it for a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| And it was the other end of the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| And so for us to come back and use these funds, I would say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| probably wasn't their wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| There are other ways to build schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| I don't think we need to build a school this way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| I don't think we did a good job on this one in terms of going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1451)|
| 0:24:19| and getting the schools funded the way that they should be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| The experts do a priority analysis on what can be done, build, remodel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| And this isn't a district thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| This is just an issue where we got outside of our box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| So, you know, with that said, like I say, I will be voting in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Just to show, as a white glove, one, no, I'm not going to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| I'm waving the flag on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| But more importantly, to say, let's not do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Let's come together and let's not do it this way again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| There are better ways to get our agenda items done and completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Item number 28, Resolution 805,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| is establishing a general county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| and making appropriations from the several funds for departments, institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| offices and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013 and ending June 30, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| I'd like to make a motion that we pass without recommendation until we have the hearings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Any questions while we have the opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I believe that the finance director stood up like he was going to come down and say something to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| So I'd like to hear what he may have had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| So I'll see where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| He wants you to vote for it today, is what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| If you would, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Name and address again, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I'm here to just answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| I'm just so eager to do so, that's why I jumped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| So don't wander off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| The way I understood this from past discussion was that this is normal transaction of allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1576)|
| 0:26:26| or dedicated or checkmarked money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Use some terminology like that and tell me I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| So basically what this resolution is doing is this is just the appropriation of the operating funds for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1596)|
| 0:26:45| So it's funds from the general fund to public library, governmental library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| I can go on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Schools, engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So it's just appropriating the funds for the operating budget of the county for fiscal year 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1613)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Ms. Rawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| I'm going to leave my comment for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| I'll make my comments during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| We have the motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Page eight, item number 29, resolution 806.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| Tax rates for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013 and ending June 30, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| Make a motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Any further discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I just had one on this, Chris, just to reiterate what you said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| What are we expecting on tax rate given the information that you've given us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| So the budget before you includes the same tax rate, which is $2.36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| That does not take into account the reappraisal process that is now going forth in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| property assessor's office, which will be approved by the state in June or July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| and then come back to county commission in July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| So this is just going forward with the same tax rate, and then we will make that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| At that time, once the state has certified our new tax rate and it's revenue neutral to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| so we'll just adjust the pennies down and the penny on the tax rate up and it's neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| And the motion is for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Item number 30, resolution 807.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| It's adopting the five-year capital improvement plan for fiscal years 2014 through 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| and appropriating funds for the first year of the plan in accordance with said plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Motion to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1747)|

| 0:29:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Page nine, item 33, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| It's approving private Chapter No. 6, which is House Bill No. 1269 of the 108th Tennessee General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| to repeal Chapter 64 of the Private Acts of 1971 relative to the Office of Legislative Affairs for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| and requesting the Knox County Law Director to ensure that the required notice of the Knox County Commission's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| of said private acts is sent to the Tennessee Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| And this, of course, is because that office is closed, it requires some legal housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| both from a resolution and from ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| So No. 36 is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| It goes with that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Any questions and discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| So the office is abolished, and this gets our code in line with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Item No. 34, resolution 904, is requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| to recommend amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to remove distance regulations for the sale of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| from the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Let's have a motion first here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I'd like to make a motion to defer for 30 days or to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Not Monday, but the next meeting, the following meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| You want to wait, Arthur, or you want to go ahead and say something about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| All I was going to do, Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| is on this matter and the two ordinances at 37 and 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| I spotted these Saturday and notified Mr. McMullen and Mr. Rutan with Weigel's of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| They tried to notify other people in the retail beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| You've got to have the microphone, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Other retailers of beer, which would include Wal-Mart, grocery stores, Dollar General, who else can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| Smoke shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Have a chance to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Arthur, before Mr. Seymour, before we get going on this too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| could I have the law director explain exactly why we're proposing this at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| and then we'll let you all respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Would you do that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| What was discovered earlier, I think we had this at the first meeting when I became law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| what we're trying to do is get the beer regulations underneath the beer ordinance and out of zoning, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| and trying to align the beer regulations in Knox County with those of the statute of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| And that's the main purpose behind this, along with some of the other issues before you as it relates to beer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| And so that's kind of how this came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And the numbers and procedures that are evident in this particular resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| and ordinance are reflective of the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| So that was the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Mr. Seymour, would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| We're going to defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| And we will try to notify other people in the business and let them know of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| so we can have input with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| That's all we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| That will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Basically, we're taking it from one pocket and putting it in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| And the rules stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| Well, no, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| It's getting it into the place, getting this distance requirement into the part of the code where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| So it's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| It's another way from MPC moving it into the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| But it's the same regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Well, it's the MPC and BZA have had some problems with BZA adjusting that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| And that's the reason why the law director feels this is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| This is kind of odd coming from a teetotaler Baptist that really doesn't drink alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| But, you know, I think the two things that concern me here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| is I understand what the law director is trying to do and put it into ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| But if we put this into ordinance, I just kind of looked at my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| And I know they're grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| I'm not trying to scare anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| But, you know, we've got a food city on Middlebrook that sits adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| I have a Weigel's that sits adjacent to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| I have another food city that's adjacent to a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| I have Double Dog Cafe in Casa de Gallo that's within the 500 or so feet of a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| There's a Shell gas station across the street from a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| That would eliminate all of that development and all of that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| And so I think having it inside the zoning ordinance allows for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| If it's in ordinance, there's no variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| There's no saying, well, that's a great piece of commercial property that abuts up to a residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| You know, that food city out there on Middlebrook Park is very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| And with this ordinance, we could not have built that food city or they couldn't have built it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| And there's no variance allowed on an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| But if it's in zoning, there's variances allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| And so I think it gives us the ability to look at an area, you know, North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| And I know it's in the city, but if somebody wanted to build Hardin Valley Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| they couldn't put a Publix or a Target in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| And so I think that's a serious issue if there's no ability to take it and do a zoning variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2121)|
| 0:35:31| So that's kind of why I wanted to look at a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| I wanted a delay to kind of plot the map and the parks and the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Because, you know, I think Knoxville is kind of known for having a church on every corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| So I think we'd eliminate a lot of good development that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Other discussions to be deferred until the June meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| We'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Thanks, gentlemen, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| This is Ordinance 13-5-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| It's repealing Chapter 2, Article 6 of the Knox County Code relative to the Office of Legislative Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-102 adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| So it just goes with abolishing of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2196)|

| 0:36:46| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 4, Article 1, entitled Beer, to establish a new section 4-13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2206)|

| 0:37:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| This is a totally different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Pull that mic a little closer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| This is a totally different issue than what we're looking at in the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| I think this stands alone and could be voted on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| That's what we just made the motion for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Oh, I just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| It was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| No, he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| He said to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| So it's before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| I'm going to turn this light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| You mean he had his light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| I'd just like the law director, if you don't mind, just to kind of give a general sketch on what this is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| or compelling the sellers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| This was brought as a recommendation from the Beer Board to County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| The purpose of this and with the amendment is to ensure that the servers who are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| or the employees who are actually distributing the beer to the customer are aware of their own personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2340)|
| 0:39:08| criminal liability in their behavior when they sell to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and that they are aware of the actual criminal implications to them personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| that would affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| And what this ordinance does is to ensure that they have been informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| and that they sign a form that recognizes to the beer inspector and to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| that they are aware of those implications when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| and if violations occur and come before the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| That's basically it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| So they're getting that information in their training class, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| They're being told verbally exactly what the consequences of selling to minors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| And this is going to, you know, put belts with those suspenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and make sure that they've got a, yea, verily, I acknowledge that I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| So, you know, hopefully folks are listening to what we've been, I think, saying for a few years in terms of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2403)|
| 0:40:14| with institutions selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| And, you know, hopefully this will ring true that they'll, when they put their signature down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| that they'll stand by that signature and ensure that we're not selling alcohol to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| This comes from a parent of a proud 18-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| So thank you for this resolution, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Mr. Chairman, I applaud you for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| I think it is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I have made my living for the last 33 years putting pieces of paper in front of people and having them sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| And as you know, Commissioner Brown, we're in the same business of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| And they just start signing, signing, signing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| They don't really look what they're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Is there a way, and this is for the law director, and this is just a suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| but I would like to see if you're going to put this in, and I read in the paper how it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| stated, but if you actually spell out the dollar amount, that's going to catch their eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| If you say $500, then $1,000, then $1,500, they're going to see that quicker than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| You read the sentences and stuff, and I know how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| When they're in a hurry, they've just got the job, and they're just, oh, yeah, I'll sign this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| But when you put an actual figure, that catches their eye, and they're going to remember that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| That's just the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| I would like to see that put in there if you think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| I agree with you, but I think that's something we'd have to do as a beer board, would we not, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| The way this ordinance works to avoid having to come back and affect the ordinances over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| the ordinance actually creates this possibility through a resolution of approval of a form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| and the form will be coming before a county commission in its specificity as a second piece to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| So throughout time, if the rules change, meaning it becomes more than a Class A misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| or something happens as it relates to from the state or even from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| then we can amend the form by resolution without reinstituting the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| So the form itself is going to address with specificity the criminal offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| which, in fact, is 11 months, 29 days up to and up to a fine of $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| So that will actually be in the form you will be having an opportunity to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| or not approve with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| I just know how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| You know, when you sign up for the job, you sign up for the health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| and the other things that are out there, and they'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| They'll remember seeing that $500, $1,000, $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| My only comment on it is certainly the intent is that it's something that does make the seller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| the actual seller, think very carefully about the implications of what it would mean to him in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| and his pocketbook right now, criminal record, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| And so it would serve to be a deterrent possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| And I'm hoping that I'm not, this doesn't place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| and as far as my conversation with the law director, this is not a big hardship on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| It's another document that they've got to go through in the training process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| So we don't intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| But hopefully it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| It helps and helps emphasize how serious we are about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| So thanks for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| And all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| You said during the training process, this is supposed to be done by the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| Is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Mr. Law Director, it would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| During the hiring process when they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Because, I mean, I can see any of us, you know, look back when you were in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| I want to get this over with so I can get this, you know, on with the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I'll sign anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| But when you go to get hired, and if it's another piece that reinforces something that you've already been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| and like Mr. Smith pointed out, seeing that number on there, I think it'll have a little bit more weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| I just want to be sure it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| By the trainers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Page 11, Item Number 39, Ordinance 13-5-104 is amending Knox County Code Chapter 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| Article 2, entitled Peddlers and Solicitors, to provide certain additional exemption from programs operated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| not-for-profit organizations in Section 12-27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| This amends Ordinance O-97-5-101, adopted July 28, 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I'll call Commissioner Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Or move to approve first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Commissioner Dawson, you're being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| Sorry to rustle you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2710)|
| 0:45:19| Mark, you want to go into a little bit of detail and tell them what the changes are here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| I'm not sure what you're speaking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Oh, that was the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| No, we're just talking about that Peddlers, the exemption for non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| It didn't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| We may need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Jumping ahead of ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| I was just going to ask what the exemptions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Mr. Law Director, why don't you define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Will you define that again for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| In particular orders, what we found out was in the ordinance that was passed back in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| there were certain activities by non-profits that basically they would have something similar to a flea market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2766)|
| 0:46:17| Especially one particularly that came to our attention was the Santa Claus project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| And it is not like your traditional transit vendor or solicitor that comes in with products to really sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2784)|
| 0:46:34| These are like hand-produced products and stuff that they sell to raise money to give to the, you know, toys for Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2794)|
| 0:46:43| And they only charge like $5 for a vendor to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| And then when you add on 50 here, 50 here, and 50 here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| it basically takes away the entire incentive for this charitable approach to raise money to get to the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| So we were asked to see if we could modify the ordinance to exclude these type of activities from charitable organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2819)|
| 0:47:09| And so that's what this basically does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Do they have to be a 501C3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| So it has to be a legitimate charitable organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| They still have to get the permit level for the overall site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| In other words, the safety aspect of it is taken care of with that permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| but we're eliminating the licensuring and the other layers that come in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| And then everybody underneath that, my understanding, talking with codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| this would make sure that they had ample parking and still make sure that they were off the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| It would still achieve what the commission was trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| without having the multi-layers of every table that was there being charged $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| On the cost, when we had our meeting, we had said that it was $50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| You had to get a permit for $50 and then $50 a month for each month you were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| And that's still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| I think that the licensing is, I can't recall off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| I thought it was 60 or 90 days, more than 50, less than, not $50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| I think there was a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| I just don't recall off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| I don't believe it was monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Can I get clarification on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| And the reason I ask is I had a lady call me who makes potholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| And she was told she had to get one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| She said, what is this transient vendor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| She said, I've got to pay $50 a month, 50 here, 50 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| She was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| I just want to get it cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Because she obviously said, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I don't make $50 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| So I don't want to hurt these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| But by the same token, we want to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| But can I get clarification on what the exact cost is if someone gets this license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| and then what is it per month or a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I'll have it for you for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Commissioner Hammond, that's just, you know, for people on the side of the road selling stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| I don't know if she'll be on the side of the road selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| I don't know if she called and said she was told she had to have a transient vendor's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| She called me and said, what is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| I've never heard of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| And she said she was being quoted all these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| And I said, I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Let me find out for sure at our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| And I said, we'll get it on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| So that's why I want to make sure that it's totally clear to everybody what the cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| You know, if she's at a church bazaar or something like that, she wouldn't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| For the law director, if we do, we really need to make sure that law enforcement knows this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| for the non-profits because I think they're going to be the ones really enforcing this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| They just need to know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| It's not law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| It's a zoning issue, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| But I think that the law or the sheriff's office will be the ones on the weekends and stuff stopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| and seeing the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| That's when it takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| Do you, Mr. Hammond, are you okay with the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And just go ahead and we'll find that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| Yes, because, you know, we can always pull it off if we need to next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Just as a comment, also, in terms of my discussion with Mr. Green, who owns the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| or has the charity year-round Santa Claus, he still has to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3036)|
| 0:50:46| He has to abide by our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| He has to provide the same safety requirements than anybody else would for our permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3047)|
| 0:50:56| licensing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| So it's just to help those people that are trying to help him raise money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| and that they're not all responsible for the individual licensing requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| The next item is item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| It's ordinance 13-5-105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| entitled Base Personnel Policies to provide for the payment of unused accumulated sick leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| to retiring Knox County government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| This amends Ordinance O-02-7-101, adopted August 26, 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| Ordinance 07-7-101, adopted August 27, 2007, establishing Section 2-775 previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3097)|
| 0:51:48| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Hey, can I make a quick statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| I just want everybody to note that Commissioner Brewer is a county mayor on the same Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| agreeing on an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Go ahead and raise the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| Are you not going to hug, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| We'll hold that for later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Heck, I was going to kiss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Well, we have the distinguished Mark Jones with Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Would you all like to tell us a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Or Chris, either one, to explain what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| This is a good thing for the county, and I think it's a good thing for our employees, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| This is Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I'm 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Basically what this does, it's incentive for the employee to save their sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| and it rewards employees when they go to retire and with some money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| Benefits the county and hopefully by incentives to save sick leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| which will, again, increase productivity for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| And I think that's the major objectives of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Mr. Hammond, do you or Mr. McKenzie, you've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| Is there a cap on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Does it roll over after so many days it goes against your retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| helps out with your pension, for those on pension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Or if they save forever, they'll get paid forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| Is there, like, a diminishing, you know, 75%, 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| I just know several other plans have done that, so I just wanted to know a little more of the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| It caps at 800 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| So the amount of money is $10,000 is the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Mr. Hammond, you're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Item number 41, Ordinance 13-4-102 is amending Article 2 and Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| Appendix A of the Knox County Code, to regulate electronic message center signs in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| Is there a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Discussion for EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Yes, this will be the same thing as, I guess, Item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| The people who have message centers now, are they grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Those that are currently there would be grandfathered in, just like the electronic billboards or anything else in the past, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| So they would not be able to have scrolling or any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| It would just be a static message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| But those that are in right now would be able to continue on with their messaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| There is a caveat in there, though, that if they tear down one sign, even though they put it back in the same place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| it's not that doesn't grandfather it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Mr. Donaldson, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| I'm Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| The ordinance as drafted addresses grandfathered signs with regard to their operating characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| in that they have to meet the operating characteristics that are established here as far as their messaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3314)|
| 0:55:22| The static hold time applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| The instant change of message applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| The minimum size of the font, if it's possible, applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| So the message within the electronic message board would have to meet the new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3337)|
| 0:55:46| They wouldn't be able to use scrolling messages, the fire burst transitions and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3346)|
| 0:55:55| That's only applicable if they have the technology to make it under the current sign they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| They don't have to tear the sign down to make it comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| So if they do not have the capability to change those operating characteristics that we're requiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| they don't have to change them within that sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| I don't remember that issue being discussed at all when the city adopted these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| and I've heard no issues as far as people having the technology to comply with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3383)|
| 0:56:31| other than the visit Knoxville sign that scrolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| That was locked in as a scrolling sign and happens to be in an area of the city where moving signs are permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3396)|
| 0:56:46| So with their approval on that particular sign was to slow down the scroll as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| But most of the signs have the capability of making an instantaneous switch to a static message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3413)|
| 0:57:04| So, Mr. Chairman, to be more specific, let me give this example in this consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3424)|
| 0:57:13| If it exists and it's grandfathered, at Walgreens, at Harbinson's Crossroads, it has a scrolling sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| And whether it's legal or not, with this new ordinance, they cannot have a scrolling sign grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| So what they have right now scrolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| So in the future, it cannot scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| It has to be static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| What's the part that's being grandfathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Just that the sign exists with a static presentation, no scrolling sign, which it is scrolling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3464)|
| 0:57:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| The dimensional requirements for the signs are what are being grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| The operating characteristics that are in this ordinance would apply to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| I'm trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Inside the city, there are no signs then that scroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| I mean, I talk about the historical overlay here with the Visit Knoxville and with the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| But are there no Walgreens or Kroger's or Kmart's or anything that has any of those types of signs that scroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| inside the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| There are not supposed to be any that now scroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| or have a transitional use of changing lights to a new static image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3515)|
| 0:58:44| It's supposed to be instantaneous and with a 60-second hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| So I'm wondering if they know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| I don't think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I know that the city did a very extensive reach-out when this ordinance was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| and contacted all of the property owners that they knew of that had electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3539)|
| 0:59:07| and achieved a very significant percentage of voluntary compliance without visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| Who's scrolling, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| No, there's a lot of scrolling signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| I'm just wondering, you know, if we're saying that they're, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| I'm wondering about the accidents that have occurred at the Visit Knoxville sign and down at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| Because, I mean, they're bright and they flash and all of this, and I haven't heard of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Well, those two are exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Well, I know they're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| That's what I'm saying is that, you know, we're allowing all these exemptions, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| the small business person and the business person were saying, no, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Yet these other people can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I just have an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| I'm going to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Back to Commissioner Wright's scenario there at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| Mark, can, all right, it's that, what is it, Walgreens or CVS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| Walgreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| If it's scrolling, you're saying we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| But can it change without a scroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Just saying Cokes are $1.79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Instead of it scrolling, it can, every so many seconds, it can flip it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Whatever the seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Just as long as it doesn't scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| We can change the measures throughout the day, but just so it doesn't scroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Anything else, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| We've got one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Warren, Wright, Smith, O and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| Four nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| We've got a man that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| My name is Joe Lovatino, 6842 Bogger Pondway, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| I signed up to speak about Item 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| I didn't realize that this was one of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| There's been talk about how you're going to eliminate scrolling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| yet you're going to restrict signs to having certain character sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| You've got message centers that are in existence that are two-line message centers that will have to display the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3687)|
| 1:01:35| complete message on that message without being able to continue it on the next screen, which is impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3695)|
| 1:01:44| I put a whole thought on one little message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| It's not a billboard that's 678 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| It's a, at most, 32 square foot message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| This ordinance is full of holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| You can't transition into a next screen with a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| You only have a hold time of one minute or ten seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| These message centers were designed, engineered, and manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| and sold to be used as changeable messages, and you're restricting them to be in a static message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| You're going to allow Walgreens, because they're a big box store, to display messages that will likely not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3740)|
| 1:02:29| in compliance to this ordinance if you adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| And what do you say to other people who have made sizable investments in these displays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| not the least of which you've got businesses, small businessmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| who would love to participate in this type of medium and this technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| and use it to its fullest to grow their businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| and yet you're going to handcuff them at a time when our economy is still struggling to get back up on its feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3768)|
| 1:02:57| I think it's a terrible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| It's an injustice to all of the people who have them and who would like to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3778)|
| 1:03:08| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Thank you, Mr. Levitano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| This comes back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| I mean, we'll have it again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| So we've got to go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| So you'll have another opportunity if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3804)|
| 1:03:24| I've been attending all these meetings and I've been listening to the pros and the cons, mostly cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| And what was just mentioned by Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| the fact that the convention center does not have any record of having accidents as a result of animation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| video images, you know, scrolling from one message to the next message with transitional effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| Now all of a sudden it's dangerous in all other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| It makes no sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| I don't understand how this is something that had been blindly adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| or attempted to be adopted at this point without getting the true facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Thank you, Mr. Levitano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| I do also have Ms. Rankin has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| We're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Well, it's just we're just combining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| I'll promise to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| I don't have much voice anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Joyce Felt, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| First of all, we don't know what the accident statistics are because that data just is not collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| And it's certainly not collected in any kind of systematic manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| I can tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Commissioner Hammond did that a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| There was a pedestrian killed in front of the visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| A bus driver hit a pedestrian that was crossing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| But did the sign play a role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| We don't know that because that was not reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| But I can easily see that either the bus driver or the pedestrian was distracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| and not watching where they were going by that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| I think that the, you know, in the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I presented a lot of safety data regarding digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| I'll be glad to review that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| I won't do it right now, but I think that all of that data applies to the EMCs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| With regard to what the gentleman just said about the incomplete messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| all the signs in the city came into compliance except for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| That sign is owned by Lamar Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| It sits on top of a billboard on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| It advertises athletic events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| It scrolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| The city has asked Lamar to stop scrolling and to come into compliance with the city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| and Lamar has refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| The Walgreens, the CVSs, everybody in the city that has an EMC were able to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| They had no problems with adopting the specified operating characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| They are able to complete their messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| So the fact that they would not be able to complete their message is a false argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3967)|
| 1:06:15| Scenic Knoxville supports this change to the ordinance with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| We do not support a maximum area of 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| We think that's way too big, and we think the maximum area should be 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| And I'll save the rest of my remarks for next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| I just want to say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| As far as taxes, we need the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| I'm a small business owner myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Any community needs a thriving business community to survive economically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| but the business community needs the residents, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| And in Knox County, it's important to recognize that the residents pay almost twice as much in property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4008)|
| 1:06:56| than do the business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| So I think it's important to listen to the wishes of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you, Ms. Fowle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| We've already voted on this, so it will go forward next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| The next item is number 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| It's spread of record, the required report on debt obligation form filed with the State of Tennessee regarding the capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| leasing transaction with SunTrust Bank in the amount of $13,182,024| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| for the purpose of acquiring energy management equipment for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| This is approved by Resolution R-13-3-201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| We don't even need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| It's spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| We don't even need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| So thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Go ahead to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| Number 45 has been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Discussion on the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| If you would you like to do something else on 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| No, I would like to have a nice recess before we move into our budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| 46 is next, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Shouldn't we take up Commissioner Hammond since that kind of will close out the meeting beginning to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| No, she said we weren't doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| I'm talking about Commissioner Hammond added an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Let's take that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| And then without objection we'll take a break and then start up on the budget issue of 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| We've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Let's do spread of record from Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| This has been added to the agenda, the spread of record letter from Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4122)|
| 1:08:51| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Now, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| We don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| We don't have to comment or vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| There's no vote to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| There's no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| It's just spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| But I thought it had to be at a regular monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| It will be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| It will be on the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| But it had to be read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| I mean, I guess either way that's going to happen next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| Maybe Loretta can research that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| And the other item that was added was the censure of Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| Yes, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| I'll make a motion that we censure Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| With regards to that, there must be a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| The specific reason is Commissioner Owenby, by his own admission, violated the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| approximately a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| With that violation of the law, also, there is the oath of office with regards to upholding the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4195)|
| 1:10:04| And so, those are my reasons for the censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| I don't wish to belabor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| I don't wish to get into a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| But I do think that we, as a commission, need to take action with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| And so, that's why I'm bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| We've got to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| We've got to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Does that mean we'll discuss this next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| We'll still have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| And who are the pass votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| And Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| And who were the no votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| We're going to recess for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| Could I make an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I am going to have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| I'm going to have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| I have the honor of being on program for a street dedication for Ms. Juanita Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| a great civic leader and my former teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| So, I'm going to have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| If you all go long, I'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| We'll be back here at 335.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| Have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| Let's get started on the rest of our agenda prior to the public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4303)|
| 1:11:50| which should just about put us on time for the 4 o'clock public hearing, I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4310)|
| 1:12:05| It doesn't look like the commissioners are very interested in discussing with the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| No, they are, surely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4331)|
| 1:13:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| Sorry for rustling you into your seat and then suddenly we had a commissioner who realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| they had not used the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| That's the way we are sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| We forget these bodily functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| We're so intense on serving Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4404)|
| 1:13:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4435)|
| 1:14:15| This week, there is a professional golf tournament at Knox County's course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| three ridges, and it's called the National Golf Association Tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| And it is, it's, they had it the first year, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| It's like the minor leagues of golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| It's like single A professional golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| A lot of, a lot of fellows that have just come off their college careers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| and started into the first leg of a professional career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| And so I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys competitive golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| It's really a nice, first of all, the course is a beautiful venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| It's in great, great shape now that the county has taken it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| and not decided to give the private company control of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| or financial control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| But anyway, it's really, it's this week and it'll be, there's a program on Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| and then the four rounds, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| It's really a fun thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| And I haven't been to many golf tournaments, but I enjoy going to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| And if you're really rambunctious, you can almost be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| Carry these guys' bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| They, you know, they do it all themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| This is real low-level care that they get, you know, at this level of professional golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4540)|
| 1:15:49| So some of them, they carry their own bags and they walk the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| And so we jumped in last year, a couple of us, and carried the bags for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| They were greatly appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| So I hope you can come out and see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| All right, Madam Clerk, are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Let's go forward with item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| We're on item 46, discussion with department heads, elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| and school administration regarding the proposed Knotts County budget for fiscal year 2013 through 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| What I intended was if any of the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| or commissioners have questions for department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| but any of you department heads that are here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| if you would like to address us with some consideration of your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| or questions that you might have or concerns that you might have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| this is the time and I don't have a list of order or preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4603)|
| 1:16:49| We'll just leave it open to the department directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| and they may come forward as they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| And if they do not wish to speak, they do not have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| So we'll start with department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Anybody like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| This is going to make for a quick, very quick meeting if we do it like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| You're not a department head, you're an elected official, Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| So hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| So if I have no questions, do we have questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Ms. Sprawls, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I have questions regarding the funding from the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| I think all of us have gotten communications about the decrease in library funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| and also with the rescue, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| Rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| So those are the two things that I wanted to discuss today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| was if we can make adjustments to library funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| and if we can make adjustments to the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Those are the only two particular issues that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| So that's basically to Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Yeah, and to the library and anybody who's here who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Is there a representative from the library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| Friends of the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| Ma'am, would you like to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| And just come on and give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| and your organization there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| My name is Martha Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I live and have lived for over 40 years at 4109 Forestland Drive, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4717)|
| 1:18:48| I'm here today to speak on behalf of the library system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| and I'm speaking with the authority of the Friends of Knox County Library behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4734)|
| 1:19:05| I want to make it very clear before I begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| that the Friends have not consulted the director of the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| in reaching our position on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| We did not do so out of respect for her unique position as an employee of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4758)|
| 1:19:27| Instead, we have consulted with Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| finance director who's been very helpful and very forthcoming, and other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4771)|
| 1:19:41| I'll begin by saying that we understand that the mayor and the commissioners must prioritize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| and we are happy to see that the overall library budget reflects a small increase over last year's funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4789)|
| 1:20:00| Primarily, we understand to support an increase in the salaries for the good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4800)|
| 1:20:07| who serve the citizens of Knox County on the library staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| We note with concern, however, that though the library requested a budget of $11,844,346,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4814)|
| 1:20:26| the proposed budget recognizes a shortfall of $925,990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4826)|
| 1:20:39| In the past years, during the economic downturn, the library's budget has suffered numerous cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4839)|
| 1:20:50| However, we understand that there is a better economic picture at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| giving the county commission the opportunity to restore some of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| We believe that a library system is an essential component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| to the economic development of Knox County and to the educational system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4871)|
| 1:21:21| I'll give some examples of its association with the education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| I happened to be at Lawson McGee one day when some little boys from the STEM Academy came in to do research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| for a project that they were going to enter in a history contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| By golly, those guys won at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| And the STEM students, of course, use Lawson McGee as their library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| The Children's Festival of Learning, which took place just this past Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| is an important project run by the library system to stop the so-called summer slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4915)|
| 1:22:06| and the loss of reading skills in particular that students often suffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| when they are out of school for summer vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| We also know that every one of the neighborhood branches has marvelous activities throughout the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4938)|
| 1:22:27| to encourage young people, teens, and adults to enjoy summer reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| We also believe that an active and modernized library system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| is essential to the economic growth of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| Many jobs nowadays must be researched and applied for on computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| and yet national statistics tell us that 37% of our residents do not have that access at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4973)|
| 1:23:04| So what we're asking for is that the commission restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| or increase the per capita expenditure for our library system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| by a sum that will help our system to move forward instead of backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| I might add we're not asking for a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| The Friends of Knox County Public Library have worked very hard to raise over $50,000 every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5008)|
| 1:23:38| which we invest in that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| So we ask you to reward our efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| and to protect what we consider to be a vital institution, one that is seriously underfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Okay, thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| Okay, Ms. Broils, did you want someone from the rescue squad to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| Well, I wanted to have a discussion about the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Is there anybody else here that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| I know there's some other people here that are supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| and there's some people here who would like to speak but can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| Hi, I'm Mary Rose, and it seems like I got here just in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| I'm one of the over 1,000 members of the Friends of the Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| and I'm here to support the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| but I wanted to be here also as a common citizen, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| I'm fortunate enough that I have a computer in my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| However, last week the modem went out, and it took me a day or so to find out what was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| I called the Internet provider, and they were going to e-mail me a new modem overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5093)|
| 1:25:01| and 72 hours later I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| And so there were four days that I was, quote, unquote, dead in the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| But I was able to go to the halls branch of the library and use their computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| and I was just here to say how grateful I am for the services that the library does provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5118)|
| 1:25:28| Thank you, Ms. Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| Well, I'm a firm believer in that our library system is an important component of our educational system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| especially when we look at the kids who use the library, especially the computers after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| A lot of the kids in my district don't have computer access at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| and they have to either use the computer at school or the computer at the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| And I realize this may not seem like a big deal in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| But if you all have beautiful branch libraries in your districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I've got the worst branch library in the entire system in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| And if you don't believe it, I'll meet you down there tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| and we can take a little walk around the building because it only takes about 30 seconds to do the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| It's very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| It's very outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| It's very cramped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| And this facility is used by neighborhood children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| You all know I have more senior citizens in subsidized housing in my district than anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| They all go use that library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| And, you know, the libraries have been seriously cut the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| and I haven't complained about it because lots of people were receiving cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| But now our revenues are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| And, yes, the budget was increased some from last year, but it's still lagging far behind what it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| So I'm hoping that we can find a way to bump this up a little bit to support our library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5213)|
| 1:27:01| They are an important component of our senior citizens' lives and of our students' lives and our community fabric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| So if you don't use your local library, you may not realize how much goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| And if you've got a beautiful branch library in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| you may not realize what it's like to have a small, cramped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| outdated one in your district that so many people are dependent on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| So this is something that's very, very important to me, and it's very important to the people in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| So I hope that we can talk about it further this week, and it will also become important to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| This is a library subject but of a different nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| The county owns the building at Lost McGee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| So we're responsible for the upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| They've been trying to get the roof patched over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| I don't know whether PBA was managing that or not, but the roof's been leaking over there for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| And I know they've had some problems, and I just wondered, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| if part of that was figured in, this extra money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| were they responsible for some of their own upkeep or what's the deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| They don't utilize PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| They found it was cheaper to outsource or do it in-house or custodial work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| So I don't know if PBA would be responsible for that ceiling repair or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| But I know that they hire their own building maintenance and upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| They do that in-house instead of PBA because it was cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| The library does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| But if it comes down to, well, in this case, it would be exterior building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5319)|
| 1:28:46| Is that their responsibility or is that county's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| Chris, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| They have their own maintenance department, and they handle all those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| And they do not utilize PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| And I'm not going to ask Ms. Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| We can ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| As far as the roof, I don't know the details of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| I can get into some things that may answer some of Ms. Brule's questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| and others that may have some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| In 2011, the libraries ended the year with about a $248,000 surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5358)|
| 1:29:26| In 2012, they had about a $133,000 surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| I would call revenue over expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| Those we needed to build up their fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| But if they have a surplus again this year and want to use some of that money to purchase some computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5378)|
| 1:29:46| and in my conversations that I've had with friends of the library, that was the main concern was computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| And we can use some of their surplus money to help offset those computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| And let me just get into the fact of why we cut capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| I've talked to them about this, and I'll inform you all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| When we decided, when the mayor said we wanted to include a raise for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| so we put a raise in there for employees, and also we increased the employer's portion of health insurance 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| When we decided to do those two things, the first things that we looked to reduce would be one-time capital expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5420)|
| 1:30:28| That you make and do a year without until we grow into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| So that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| We reduced their capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| I think the previous year they had $100,000, so we kind of cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| If you look from actual FY13 to proposed 14, don't look at requested so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5440)|
| 1:30:50| So we made that reduction in an attempt to give their employees a raise and to offset health insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5450)|
| 1:31:00| And I would also point out, and we can talk about this as well with Marita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| is in their public improvement fund, libraries has about $300,000 at the end of FY2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5466)|
| 1:31:18| so about $300,000 in capital that they could utilize for some of their needs that they put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| whether it be shelving or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| And we've also included for facility upgrades $200,000 in capital in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5486)|
| 1:31:35| I'll let her answer the roof question, but that's just some information I thought I would share that may be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5495)|
| 1:31:44| as we have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Thank you, Mr. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| If this big increase here was partly for the roof, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| No, sir, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| The roof issue that we have had at Lawson McGee is a result of the hailstorm that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| and that's been a process working through risk management and insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| And those issues have been resolved, and we hope that we will move forward with the repair to the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| But that's the result of why we had the issues that we did with the leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| Ms. Black, will you identify yourself, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Marita Black, Knox County Public Library Director, 500 West Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| Do you have other things here, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| No, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Chris, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| The monies from this fiscal year and the proposed budget, what is the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| The budget from this year and what is being proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| It was an increase of about $62,000, I do believe, if you go adopted budget from FY13 and proposed of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5570)|
| 1:32:59| Let me turn there just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| That's what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| $62,418 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| And would you go over those surplus numbers with me again, please, at the end of 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| and what you project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Have you projected a surplus at all for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| I have not did that for 13 yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| But in talking to their finance director back there, Scott Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| he seems to think that they're on pace again for a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| But in 2011, they had $248,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| In 2012, they had $133,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| It is true we do need to build that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| And it got terribly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| And so we're trying to build that back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| But I think if they want to purchase some updated computers with a surplus that we may have this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5617)|
| 1:33:47| then we can for sure look at that during the designation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| Do we know what the projection is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| You can't give me a specific figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I'd say about the same amount as 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| I'd say anywhere between $125,000 and $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| That would be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| We could say $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| So basically right now we're looking at a so do they have $481,000 approximately in their budget from surpluses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| that has not been spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Yeah, that would go right into their fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| And it's about $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| Now, I wouldn't want to spend it all because as a fund, they need to have two months worth of expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| You've heard me say that time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| And so we've been trying to build that fund back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| It used to be at a good level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Then we took on some additional responsibilities back in the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| and it's dwindled it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| So now we're trying to build it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| But for one-time expenses, I think we can come to some sort of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| and sit down with Marita and work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| You said they needed two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| So what would a two-month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| $12,000, you know, math at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| I'm not holding you to an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| I'm just kind of guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| I want to give you an exact figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| Two million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| I mean, they're a special revenue fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| So we're not hold to that high standard like we are with the schools or our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| But it needs to be a healthy amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| So in case the economy does turn down, we don't want to have a negative fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| So right now we've got $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| We need, you're saying, $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| With this surplus coming in, I've gotten phone calls as well about the surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Everybody sees money, and they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| hey, what is the timetable for you to really close the books and say, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| these are the funds that we have in the surplus, both for the schools and for Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| We have, by our accounting standards, basically 45 days of accruals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| So you say that's about the middle of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| And so by the time we close out, it's usually around the 1st of September before we actually know what we're going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5759)|
| 1:36:08| Now, we can tell you in July and even late June an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5768)|
| 1:36:16| But until we get final numbers through the end, through about the middle of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| then that's when we can give you an exact figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| But we will know precisely what our surplus is going to be mid-August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| So at the August commission meeting, I can tell you, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| general funds are going to have a surplus of approximately this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| We do accrue sales tax and property tax for August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| So we won't have all the property tax in yet, but we'll have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| But we'll have the sales tax number, so not a big amount of property tax in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| So we can tell you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Now, the wheel tax designation goes to the libraries, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| That's what I was going to say as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| GASB 54 said in order to keep special revenue funds separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| and report them separately that you've got to give them a source of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| The source of revenue that libraries get is the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| And we're seeing an increase in wheel tax currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| And so that is good for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| And so we keep an eye on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| You've halfway answered my question, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| If the wheel tax comes in short, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Make it up out of general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| I mean, we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| If a library is going to drop their fund balance real low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| then we would do a transfer from general fund over to libraries to make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| But as we speak, that's a dedicated source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| I mean, if it comes in over, would it go into their surplus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| We don't pull it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Ms. Brewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| So, Marita, what are you going to have to cut out of your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| because your request wasn't fully funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| The line item that Chris mentioned, which is capital, one-time expenditure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| those are things that we, if fund balance would be made available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| that we would certainly look at making those one-time purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| But as far as the continuation budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| that's basically what we're dealing with, the continuation budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| It will work service as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Well, what kind of items, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Can you tell me what those are that you were planning to buy with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| For the capital outlay, about 179 computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| And we had, because of the way in which CIP versus capital outlay this year was structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| we had about four projects that were in the capital request also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| above and beyond the continuation part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| And what were those projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| One would have been electrical upgrade to North Knoxville Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| One would have been to redesign for functionality the CERC area out at Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| One was various shelving for about four different facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| And the other would be a replacement of the Lawson-McGee Library doors, front doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| And the electrical that needs to be upgraded is at the North Knoxville Branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Well, again, I want to point out that our seniors who have paid taxes into our fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| tax revenue fund, for decades, in a lot of cases, are, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| the ones that are going to be hurt by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| North Knoxville, which is a low-income area, very dependent on their libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| not going to get their electrical upgrade that is obviously needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| or wouldn't have been asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| And the low-income students who depend on these computers for their school work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| and the people who are looking for jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| which we all know a lot of job searching is done online now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| The low-income people who don't have computer access at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| who have to go look for jobs on computers at the library are going to be affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| So, once again, this cut is going to affect disproportionately our very vulnerable populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| our low-income children and young adults who are looking for jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| and our seniors who have paid their taxes for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| So I hope that between now and Monday we can come up with a solution for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| Oh, I'm sorry, Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| And, Chris, you had mentioned several different suggestions to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| I'd like to have all those in writing and with kind of an either yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6055)|
| 1:41:02| I think this is absolutely possible, or this is just a suggestion but may not be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| so that I have a pretty good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| That's happened once before where I was told that, well, you know, if we go ahead and do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| well, there's something in the works that will take care of it, and that never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| So I don't want to be caught in that situation again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| Okay, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Ms. Black, I don't know if you know the answers to some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Can you explain a little bit about the electrical upgrade that you're going to do at the North Branch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| What do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| We want to replace some of the outdated electrical boxes and wiring to upgrade it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6096)|
| 1:41:46| And we have worked on lighting there in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| and we've put in new fire panels and things of that nature in the mechanical room about a year or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| And this is just to upgrade all of it to where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| Are you pulling all the wire out and putting new back in or just certain areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| Certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| And what were you doing at Powell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| Tell me again, what were you going to do at Powell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| We have a circuit area at Powell that needs some adjustments in regard to functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| It isn't large enough, and the design of it is not a ñ does not provide for a workflow in circulation function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6134)|
| 1:42:24| And we wanted to redesign that so that it would be more functional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| and would serve not only the staff but the public better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| and it would put us facing the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| And did I hear you say that you were going to try to upgrade some shelving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| You were going to try to get some more shelving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Shelving at Howard-Pinkston, shelving at Sequoia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| We have sort of a hodgepodge currently at Sequoia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| but it's to do some upgrades for Howard-Pinkston, Sequoia and Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| The shelving, do you ñ what do you do with the shelving that you take out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| It goes to county surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| If it's usable, then, of course, you know they go through the sale process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| And you mentioned that you have a ñ or the lady that came and spoke has a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| What is your board budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| She said there are about 1,000 members of the Friends of the Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| What is their budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| I wouldn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Ms. Gill might want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| I wouldn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| No, it's not county funds at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| This is within the Friends of the Library group itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| And I wouldn't have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| I thought you were connected with them or advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| No, it's a volunteer and nonprofit group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| They do their own fundraising separate from the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| And the other item, Commissioner Smith, was the Lawson-McGee Library replacement doors on the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| They have seen a lot of wear over the years, over 1,000-plus people a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| So that was the doors at Lawson-McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| Could you explain your board budget real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| Thank you for raising that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| We are, though we are passionate about the library, we are an independent 501C3 organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6241)|
| 1:44:11| We have a daily book sale, used book sale in the lobby of Lawson-McGee every day that that branch is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6251)|
| 1:44:22| We have a mega used book sale in the early spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| We have recently instituted some smaller branch used book sales so that we have been able to invest over $50,000 a year into the library system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6267)|
| 1:44:46| Some of that money goes to fulfill what we call a wish list that is submitted by the branches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| And we also help to supplement funds that the library system already has, but they are somewhat inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6294)|
| 1:45:06| For example, we helped to underwrite Children's Festival of Reading this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| We've helped to underwrite the Jazz Festival, and there are many other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6313)|
| 1:45:21| If you have further questions about our treasury, our treasurer is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| We focused on the libraries here for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| Are there other questions about the libraries or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| We're still in this category of department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| I want to ask one question to the library director, Ms. Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| Did I miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| How much do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| I mean, not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| How much do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Are you talking about in the capital line item that Chris mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Yeah, they say $925,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| What do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| Not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| Need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Basic capital outlay for computer replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| The other things were improvements within the budget request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| Not the continuation budget, but improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| So how much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| For capital outlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| About $140,000 for computers, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| And then the other $105,000 were for four capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| So about $250,000 is what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Any other discussion on libraries since we're there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Other departments, other departments want to report to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| or have questions or items of concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| Rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| Can we talk about rescue squad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| I wanted to talk some about the rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| I think we all got communication about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| And I think that's, you know, that's public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| In my book, that's something really important that I think we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| So, Chris, you said you had something in the works for that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6436)|
| 1:47:25| Well, through the adopted budget last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| their amount was $142,500 through defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| And the proposed 14 budget, you will see, you won't see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| but I can tell you that there's $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| which is about a 40% increase for the volunteer rescue squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| through the health department budget, through emergency medical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| which will be a sole source contract because the service they perform, nobody else performs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| So it's a sole source contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| And we've also worked, Jason Lay in my office worked with Allison Rogers in the share department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| and was able to get them on like a branch of our pilot contract, pilot fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| which will give them a discount on fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| And we're trying to work a way to where they may have some first dibs on some of our surplus vehicles through GOV deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6498)|
| 1:48:31| And so it doesn't meet their full request, but it is definitely an increase over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6511)|
| 1:48:45| And I'd say by percentage, it's probably the biggest increase in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| I didn't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| Are you going to recognize him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| I was going to ask him if he wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| Yeah, I didn't realize they were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| Chief, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| Chief and I spoke on the phone last night, you know, in regards to the article in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| And I think I know that their desire and his desire and the board's desire is to do a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6545)|
| 1:49:14| They've got a lot of wish lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| And there's some things that we can do that are not monetary as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| And it would have to be a discussion between the mayor and purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| and the commission about some property and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| And so those are some other things that we talked about last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| But, Chief, do you have anything you want to say or do you just want to take questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| You were out of my line of sight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| But I'm glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| You have to give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| I'm Dr. Russ Frazier, Chief of Knoxville Volunteer Emergency Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| Headquarters is 512 Chill Hwy. Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| I'll just tell you kind of how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| I mean, I'd love to be able to give them a dump truck load of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| and do some of the things they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| And he and I have spoken about a long-term, multi-year commitment as far as building a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| Because, you know, you look at a county our size that doesn't have fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| and, you know, that's kind of something that we probably need to address as a county going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| And also they respond to every accident with injury outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| And, you know, the city has a Class III fire department that responds to all of theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| with a paramedic on the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| And so they do a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| And I think partnership, long-term partnership with them would make our county safer and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6636)|
| 1:50:42| And hopefully we can get some of those things done, taken care of over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6642)|
| 1:50:48| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Chief, I'm going to let you explain on some of the things that's been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| I see Rick Emmett back there, and Rick is also on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| And I'm going to mention this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| I've just been recently put on the board, so I'm sort of going to recuse myself from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| but just tell you all an observation that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| This gentleman has come in who is a doctor and has really turned the rescue squad around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6663)|
| 1:51:09| And I'm going to let you whatever that you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| He and I have not talked about what he has here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| But, Chief, whatever you want to say, just like Commissioner Hammond asked about the library, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| what's on your wish list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| What do you need and whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| And I'll just sit back and let the commissioners make up their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| I joined the rescue squad in 1984 as a 16-year-old teenager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| It's a second home to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| I love the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| I was honored to take over as chief back in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| We have approximately 140, 145 members, over 44,000 volunteer hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| Last year alone, over 2,200 calls were run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| We respond to every motor vehicle accident within Knox County involving injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| We have the specialized equipment to extricate patients from the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| We also have search rescue, dive and water rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6726)|
| 1:52:10| We're the primary water rescue for Knox County and assist in the city limits with Knoxville Fire Department also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6730)|
| 1:52:18| We, as well, have cave and vertical rescue and structural and heavy collapse rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| And we are the only organization in Knox County with the equipment and trained to provide that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6744)|
| 1:52:34| We have gotten behind in funding and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| We're probably a good ten years behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| I'm very pleased to say that I've worked with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| They have been diligent on getting us increased funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| And we're starting to get that big, rusty locomotive moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6768)|
| 1:52:56| What's your wish list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| We have four stations, one in each quadrant of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| Our main headquarters is in east Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| Our call volume has slowly grown to the west side of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| Our highest number of car wrecks, highest number of calls are in west Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| Our station out there is a double-wide trailer with bullet holes, 14- to 15-year-old bullet holes in it from a drive-by shooting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6799)|
| 1:53:27| With, you know, linoleum coming off the floor, we need permanent stations, safe stations during inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6807)|
| 1:53:36| We don't, the rescue squad does not own the property where the west station sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| It's Knox County property, so we cannot build a permanent structure on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| We're sort of in the same situation in south Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| Our station out there is on Knox County Schools property, so we're unable to build a permanent structure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| We have four first-out rescue trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Some of our trucks date back as far as 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| Two of our chief's vehicles are 1996 models with over 250,000 miles on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6844)|
| 1:54:12| that were given to us by Knoxville Police Department when Chief Ivey Sterling was in position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| Our rescue trucks rack up miles going up and down from one end of the county to the other daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6858)|
| 1:54:25| We're constantly having to work a new rescue truck in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Of those, we have four that can cost around $170,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| Our insurance alone is over $60,000 a year, so it takes a huge bite out of our budget right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6876)|
| 1:54:48| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Hey, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| I think the rescue squad is kind of like the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| You don't need them until you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| And then when you need them, you expect them to be there and provide a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| If I call the rescue squad or the rescue squad has called for me for whatever reason, do I reimburse the rescue squad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6897)|
| 1:55:03| Do you send me a bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| We are 100% volunteer, send no bills, make no charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| So, basically, we're funding you through our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| So this is a service, basically, that we're getting by providing you with taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| How do you get your additional funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| You don't get all of your funding through Knox County, I wouldn't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| We get some funding from the city of Knoxville due to our agreed upon response for water rescue calls within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6929)|
| 1:55:38| And we also have received funding from the United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| How much do you get from the United Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Approximately $102,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| My big fear with them is they are slowly getting out of the rescue service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| They discontinued providing Loudoun County's rescue squad funding last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6952)|
| 1:55:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| How much do you get from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| $44,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6961)|
| 1:56:07| So I'll ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| $170,000 for one vehicle, you know, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| And so I think we're sympathetic to you, but what exactly would you be looking for in terms of, not a wish list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6974)|
| 1:56:22| but, you know, because I know that, you know, there are a lot of things you'd like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| But as far as your needs, if you've got vehicles that are going all the way back to 1986,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| and if you've got vehicles that, you know, are going back that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| I would think your maintenance keeps going up in the amount of money that you have to, you know, pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| Plus, I would think, too, if you're having to respond to an emergency in those types of vehicles with that much mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| and that old, there's always that fear they're going to break down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| The unfortunate gentleman that drowned around New Year's went into the water off the North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7012)|
| 1:56:59| Our water rescue truck responded to that call, but on the way back to the station, it caught on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7019)|
| 1:57:07| So what is, so tell us what you feel that you need to function in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7027)|
| 1:57:15| Obviously, our rescue equipment, which can be very expensive, as well as the vehicles used to transport that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7035)|
| 1:57:23| Vehicles are always on a need list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| There's many things I could add to the want list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| I mean, all of our members pay for their own uniforms, their own bunker gear, helmets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| which is a huge thing to ask a person that's coming down to volunteer their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| A full set of bunker gear is over $1,000 right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| My priority would be dependable new vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| We have four first out rescue trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| We have approximately 14 vehicles in our fleet total, as well as four boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| Our first out rescue trucks probably rack up the most mileage the quickest, and that would be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7080)|
| 1:58:09| We are also required by the county to have four triage response team vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7089)|
| 1:58:16| basically four-wheel drives for any time there's snow, ice, any type of inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| Two of those expeditions fall under that category of four of our TRTs that we are required to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7103)|
| 1:58:31| So how much money are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| With our proposed budget, we were almost $300,000 short, and that was including buying a new first out rescue truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7117)|
| 1:58:49| So you're saying $300,000 in addition to the $200,000 that has been allocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| That was the shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7134)|
| 1:58:55| Like I said, working with the mayor's office, they are graciously able to increase our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7135)|
| 1:59:04| To get what we absolutely need, I would say at least a minimum of $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| So I want to make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| So you would like to have $300,000, but your basic need is $150,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| In addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| In addition to what you get, the $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Our budget for this year was about, I believe, $365,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| So we would have the $200,000 and then an additional need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Any other questions for Dr. Parish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you, Dr. Parish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7179)|
| 1:59:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| Can we change topics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Parks and Rec for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| There's a new sport out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7198)|
| 2:00:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Name and address there, Doug, for the viewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Doug Patel, Knox County Parks and Recreation Director, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| Doug, you had listed to me a list of some projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| that just weren't going to be able to get finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| And I think there's five or six, the Urban Wilderness, Clayton Park, John Tarleton, the Restroom Concord, and Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7225)|
| 2:00:33| Can you explain and sort of give the dollar figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| I've got the dollar figures here if you don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| Explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Yeah, and there's always, you know, numerous projects around the system we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| These are just probably the ones that are on the top of the chart right now beyond the ones that are currently funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7244)|
| 2:00:50| Urban Wilderness, as it continues to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| there's going to be a need for signs and more shelters down there that's ever-expanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| and we know there's going to be future additions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| To Clayton Park, an additional playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| Again, that's in a future phase, so that's one that will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7263)|
| 2:01:06| John Tarleton Restroom, that's a renovation of a pretty old restroom to get it up to a little better standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7266)|
| 2:01:11| and especially ADA access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| And then Concord Greenway, that's a phase two of a two-phase project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| Phase one got done last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| And then Carter Softball, we're working with Carter Park and Carter High School up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| to try to figure out better accommodations for the Carter High School softball team up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| So that's one we're working jointly with the high school on that program now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| So those are, you know, all projects on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| Additional funding will certainly get them done, but it's just a question of priority, as we certainly realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| What's that, about $170,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| Is that what you're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Honestly, I didn't add all those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| And, again, there's probably some ranges of funding in there we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| But you've got one, two, three, four, five, six other projects you could do for $170,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7316)|
| 2:02:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| Commissioner Smith, does that include the Frisley Park out at Tommy Shumpert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| We have tried within our current budget to look at that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| Once we get on with some of the repairs at Shumpert Park we're doing now on the irrigation and dog pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| we're going to have a little bit of money left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| We're going to take a little bit from what looks like will be allocated this year to purchase what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| and then do that as an in-house project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| And shuffling some of our maintenance around, we're pretty confident we can handle the mowing within our current budget right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| Because the guy's had a few of us out there, and he said there's a lot of labor of love by citizens put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7355)|
| 2:02:41| so it would be nice to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| It certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| I think we've got that slated to look at probably next spring, summer to try to get to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| We've got a lot of other in-house projects we're doing, too, so that's where we've got that one targeted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Do we have anything else for Mr. Patel while he's up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Looks like you're free and clear, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Other departments that anyone would like to hear from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Seeing none, let's just move to public officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| And Mr. Ballard came down pretty close, so why don't you jump up there, Phil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| Phil Ballard, 400 Main Street, Property Assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| I just wanted really to let you all know that I appreciate the way the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| and Chris has worked with us and my Chief Deputy, Jim Weaver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| and really I'm satisfied with my budget other than any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| Commissioners, questions for Mr. Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| Well, while you're here, I want to get something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| Just tell us about process right now and where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| and how much discontent are you experiencing in terms of reappraisal process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7442)|
| 2:04:12| Well, you know, I think a word that I had used early on is that anytime you have reappraisal, it's always contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7452)|
| 2:04:21| You can look back through the paper history in any county, there's never enough phone lines, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| But if you want to just solely compare it to 2009, we had in the informal process somewhere over 16,500 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7466)|
| 2:04:36| This time, approximately, we have around 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| The vehicle of choice to appeal this time was by telephone, which we had approximately 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7483)|
| 2:04:51| We had, using rounded numbers, 2,000 appeals online and 500 at the Cedar Bluff location in Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7491)|
| 2:05:02| And it sort of speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| It's down 65%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| I think instead of using the word contentious now, the calls that I had originally received in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7507)|
| 2:05:14| they were calling before they got their notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| People were upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| They were a lot of fear in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| And it was the first time I came into office, first time in at least Tennessee history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| were that you really had a climb in 5, 6, and probably of 0, 7, and a decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7528)|
| 2:05:36| Two and a half great years of sales in the developments, and then all of a sudden the decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7536)|
| 2:05:47| But this time, the people were very nice, easy to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| and, you know, you like to think that you captured a great deal of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| One thing that would be of particular interest to you, maybe Chris and some of the others here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7560)|
| 2:06:06| is that this will be in my fifth year as property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| And, really, when you look at new growth, new growth for the prior year was actually a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7571)|
| 2:06:22| of what it had been the other four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| And what that sort of tells you is that you've got people out there working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| You've got jobs going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Materials being bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| Hammers being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Foundations being dug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| And, you know, you can look around at your Costcos, Publix, Dow Springs, the laser center that's going to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7595)|
| 2:06:44| And almost on every corner you can see some sort of construction going on at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| So I think it's a very stable market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| I've talked to the Realty Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| It was a very stable, less than $100 increase in the price of their closed sales between 9, 10, 11, and 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7615)|
| 2:07:03| They looked at an uptick of .8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| And that pretty well twins with what I've said, Chris, with this 1%, give or take, in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7626)|
| 2:07:14| But we are seeing some promising growth out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Very good, Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| So when I was first seated, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| So when I was first seated, Phil, I was seated beside you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| So come up here for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| It doesn't seem like it's five years ago, but I guess it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| It has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Is he serious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| Thank you, Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Do you want him to continue when he comes up here as you all talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| Other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| And I see Mr. Armstrong coming down close, so I suspect the law director would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7674)|
| 2:08:01| Go ahead, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| Burt Armstrong, 400 Main Street, Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| I'm not going to ask for any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| You know how physically conservative I am when I was with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| But I thought this would be a good opportunity to bring you up to speed on really what the Knox County Law Director's Office is doing for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7694)|
| 2:08:23| and how hard and what kind of a professional staff that you have working for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| I don't often get this opportunity because usually we're up here dealing with things going live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7710)|
| 2:08:36| or you're in the office asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| But first off, we have in the law department probably I want to say eight of the best attorneys that are around in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7720)|
| 2:08:49| We have a staff of 17 people that actually carry a workload that is hard to appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7729)|
| 2:08:58| I'll give you a little example of what goes on in a day-to-day realm of the Knox County Law Department for these individuals I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7738)|
| 2:09:07| We currently have somewhere in the neighborhood of about 527 claims which are going through our offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| which can actually turn into potential litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| We have 268 cases going on right now in the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7757)|
| 2:09:24| Of those, we have 137 claims for schools alone and 63 cases going on in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7764)|
| 2:09:34| We have a vision for the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| When I came into office, there were several things that I wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| One is that we're looking at what I would call the office of the future, trying to help us become a little bit less paperless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| And the legal profession is one of the most paper-filled professions in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| And I'm doing this talk to give you kind of a heads-up of what maybe a year from now I may be coming and talking to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7796)|
| 2:10:04| But we're evaluating the potential of the technology within the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| We're running on systems that go back into the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| And the law profession has changed greatly since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| We're currently evaluating our research platform and to see in terms of our supplier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| to see what kind of basis that we can use to spring into what we would say the office of the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| where we can be a little bit more paperless, a little bit more digitally accessible from the courtrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| and cut down on some of our, if you will, copy time, paper time, carry time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7834)|
| 2:10:41| We're currently evaluating what we call the third-party administrator for workers' comp claims, which is a pretty big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| And Knox County costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| And we're evaluating ways to save money on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| We may be coming with a plan, say, into the fall on what we may or may not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| It's still under evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| But right now we also have lawyers in terms of our workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| We deal with somewhere in the neighborhood of about 530 contracts every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| Every month that we stand here and come into county commission and you read this contract amount, that contract amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| and you're approving money to be expanded, there's somebody that had to do the work behind all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7881)|
| 2:11:28| And we have to approve each and every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| And many of those we end up having to write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Other things that you don't or may not be aware of is that we have over 277 fixed meetings that we have to attend every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7894)|
| 2:11:44| On behalf of the different boards and commissions and organizations related to Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7904)|
| 2:11:52| And that doesn't take into consideration the meetings that this body schedules personally with the law department or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| And so we have quite a bit of activity going on for the money that you pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| From a personal note, I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| I come into the office quite early because it's just a habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| I did it when I was in private practice and I'm doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| And I generally leave quite late because it's just a habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| And when I come into the office, usually there's someone coming in right behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| And when I say quite early, somewhere between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| And a lot of times when I leave at 6.30, 7.30 at night, there's still attorneys in there working on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7956)|
| 2:12:44| I've been watching and following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| And I do a lot of management by walking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7966)|
| 2:12:50| I will be assessing that situation in terms of workforce needs next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7970)|
| 2:12:58| And maybe will come some recommendations at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| In addition, I have also discovered by being there this nine-month period, I guess almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| that we have no succession planning in our regular employees and staffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| I'd like to be able to look at that and come to you with a plan for that probably in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| So on behalf of the law department, we really enjoy providing the services to you and the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8001)|
| 2:13:29| And I just kind of wanted you to get a feel of what actually goes on other than just seeing myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| or David or Daniel or someone in your meetings from day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| So if you have any questions, I'll be glad to entertain those that I can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| Some of them I may not be able to answer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Thank you, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| I'm just wondering, at one time there was a suggestion made that at the detention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| that there be some type of Skyping available where they wouldn't have to bring the people all the way back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8038)|
| 2:14:04| to save on transportation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| That was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| And as I heard you talking about the upgrades and the technology and so forth, I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| has that been revisited at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| Do you know or do you think that's something that's still viable to have basically court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| And is it legal, I guess the first thing would be, to have a remote situation from the detention facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| Let me clear this up with the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| The Knox County Law Department is the civil side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| And the question that you're asking me is on the criminal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| which I'll be glad to address to a certain degree with that limited caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| I do know that our judicial commissioners, in terms of warrants and some of the interviews they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| they do that by way of video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| To what degree that's occurring, I'm really not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| And whether or not they have actually decided to enhance that program or go down that road more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8093)|
| 2:15:02| that would probably be something that specifically the sessions judges might do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8102)|
| 2:15:08| because that's where your vast volume would be coming from, would be from that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| So I kind of, kind of answer it, but I really don't deal with that day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8113)|
| 2:15:17| What are the number of cases, again, you said you're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| Right now we have 268 cases that are in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| We have 527 claims, which are issues that are before the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8123)|
| 2:15:29| that may or may not turn into full-blown lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| And you gave us the school portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| What about, does that include the Sheriff's Department too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| The Sheriff's Department's part, yes, in the 527.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8141)|
| 2:15:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Mr. Caldwell, will you stand up there beside our law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| I've got a first question for you, but I'm going to let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| Chris, our office holders that, and you may not know this off the top of your head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| you may have to do some research where you may better answer this the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| How many people as office holders do not take the travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| I know Mr. Duncan, I'm pretty sure Mr. Duncan does not take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| I think he told us he cut it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| I'm pretty sure Foster said he took it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| And, Bud, do you take any travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| The only thing in terms of travel in our budget, we do have one automobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8177)|
| 2:16:22| I'm talking about the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Me personally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| Chris, what's it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| It's $750 a month, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| Auto allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| Yeah, auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| I'll verify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| I don't know of any in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| I know there's none that's underneath the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| I do know that there may be some auto allowances in fee offices, but we can pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| I mean, I know Phil, he's on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| I mean, that's justifiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| But I just think it's commendable that, Bud, you know, from time to time you do go out, but you don't take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| I just wanted to bring that out to point that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| Because I guess something that you said a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| and I just want to see if you were still doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| I personally wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| No, I don't have an auto allowance, that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| I don't get a monthly stopping for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| As a matter of fact, unless it's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| I've taken a trip or two to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| I don't usually even charge back for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| Generally, I just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Go for the ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| You know, and, Chris, there's several office holders that take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| I don't see why in the world they take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| They don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| And there's several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| Like I can see Foster on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Foster goes to different places, checks on his satellite offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| And I think, you know. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| But he doesn't take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| I think that's very admirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Mr. Duncan, he has satellite offices, and now he's not. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| Or at least he says he wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| Back of this was not taking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| But there's some that are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| And I just don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| Okay, thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| It was my honor to be seated beside Mr. Armstrong early on in my career on County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| And to get him off the stage, come here, bud, and sit down beside me a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8286)|
| 2:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| Thank you, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| And, of course, in my position and my requirements in terms of chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| I am constantly in contact with Mr. Armstrong, Mr. Boog, Mr. Osberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| And it's very apparent how much work they do, how hard they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| And, certainly, you have this law director, and the law department has many advocates on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8307)|
| 2:18:36| And as we go into the next year, I'm sure Mr. Caldwell of Finance, they hear this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| they understand the kind of level of work that's done in that department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| and they're appreciative of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| And we'll work for them and try to do what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| So, thank you, Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| Any other elected officials that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| Elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| And that leaves us with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| So, Dr. McIntyre, if you'd like to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8351)|
| 2:19:17| Mr. Chairman, while he is on his way to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| I'd like to, again, say Gibbs High School is having its 100th year celebration this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8361)|
| 2:19:27| 430, excuse me, 530 to 730 with a program at 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| And Dr. McIntyre and Mayor Tim Burchett will both be in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| The other night while I was at the Kelley graduation at the Civic Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8376)|
| 2:19:47| School Board of Education member, India Kincannon, and I were the two people that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| We were going to bless them until you arrived and you did it or someone else did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8393)|
| 2:20:00| We had a discussion of things going on in the Board of Education, Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8400)|
| 2:20:07| Knox County in general about education, a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| And as a part of that conversation, she said that this is the most difficult time for her to try to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| and be somewhere for a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| And I said I'll be happy to say that and we'll talk about the budget again some other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| So, I wanted to make those two recognitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Mr. Smith has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| Dr. McIntyre, I have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| I've just been informed that I have a busted pipe at the 640 building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| So, I think I need to attend to that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| So, it's on the third floor and it goes all the way down to the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| So, I've got to excuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| It's just water going in a creek, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| It's good to know we'll have your sympathy on the capital budget, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Dr. McIntyre, would you like to make a statement or some person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| Certainly, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| And the budget that the Board of Education has adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| and Ms. Fugate is here from the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| but the board that the budget adopted is an increase of about $13 million from our current $406 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8473)|
| 2:21:20| It's a total budget of just under $420 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| And so, therefore, it's an increase of about $13.3 million or just over 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| As we began to develop this budget, we had lots of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| We had several budget meetings and forums out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| and heard back from people about their interests and priorities in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| I actually got a chance to talk to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| most of the commissioners over the last several months as we were looking at this budget and putting it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8504)|
| 2:21:49| And, essentially, there were four priorities that were identified for this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| The first was enhancing educator compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| And more than half of that $13 million increase is budgeted toward that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8516)|
| 2:22:05| We recognize that we want to make sure that we provide our fine educators with compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8525)|
| 2:22:14| that is commensurate with the value they provide and that is professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| Knox County Schools, as of this year, ranks 35th in the state of Tennessee in terms of our average teacher salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8538)|
| 2:22:25| and that's certainly not where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| So this budget, we built into this budget two major components in terms of educator compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8547)|
| 2:22:35| First of all, there is a step increase for both certified and non-certified personnel in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8555)|
| 2:22:43| But then, in addition to that, there's a salary increase, a base salary increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| for our teachers of 1.5% at the beginning of the year and an additional 1% at mid-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| We believe that that will allow us to make progress in bringing our salaries to be more competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8573)|
| 2:23:01| with some of the other school districts, even in our region, that pay, in some cases, considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| So we want to make some progress on the base salary, and we believe this budget will help us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| And then secondly, we want to continue our strategic compensation initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8592)|
| 2:23:18| or our performance-based pay initiative that we've instituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| It's called APEX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| It stands for Advanced Perform Excel, and it really is a way to incent and reward great teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8603)|
| 2:23:31| and great outcomes for kids, and the dollars are budgeted and allocated in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| So both of those things we're able to do within this budget that the board has adopted around educator compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8617)|
| 2:23:44| The second priority is sustaining instructional improvement initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| and you certainly remember last year we had what I like to refer to as a very healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| and robust conversation around the school's budget, and we asked for $35 million over natural revenue growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8636)|
| 2:24:04| and had lots of really good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| And ultimately the county commission appropriated $7 million over natural revenue growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| which we were very grateful for and which we believe we've made some very strong investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| important investments in classroom instruction with those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| It includes things like the work we've done around early literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| and I want to take this opportunity to thank the mayor and his staff certainly for their support around early literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| but also for working so closely with us in developing this budget that the board has adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| and Chris Caldwell and his staff have been terrific as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8675)|
| 2:24:38| So anyway, the $7 million included funding for early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Ms. Boyle was talking earlier about support for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| a considerable investment around professional development and additional instructional coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| and lead teachers providing that support for our teachers in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| Additional interventions and enrichment for our students and tutorial support for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| we utilized that $7 million for, and then additional support for magnet schools and community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| So we thought those were some really important investments that are helping us to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8708)|
| 2:25:13| to make strong academic progress in the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| and so our second priority was really to sustain those important instructional improvement initiatives in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| The third area is bolstering student safety efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| and in this budget there are three primary strategies around enhancement of student safety and school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8726)|
| 2:25:34| The first is in the operating budget, and that is the addition of 58 additional school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8734)|
| 2:25:42| to ensure that we are able to have a uniformed armed security officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| or school resource officer at every single school in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8748)|
| 2:25:53| There are also on the capital side two other, I think, important strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| One is to make sure that we have current generation video camera systems at each of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| and then also to have what we call a school access control strategy at every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| and that school access control means basically trying to make sure that we are controlling access to the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8767)|
| 2:26:14| and those who are supposed to be in the building can be and those who are not aren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| and that would entail camera buzzer systems or secure entry vestibules, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| and we're going to look at campus by campus to see what's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| So those three efforts are integrated into this budget and are part of our third priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| which is bolstering student safety efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| and then the fourth is facilitating personalized learning supported by technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| As we look at the progress that we've made over the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| and by the way, our indicators in terms of student outcomes have been very strong the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| but we want to make sure that that academic success is universal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| that all of our students share in that academic success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| and that we continue to see strong academic progress and, in fact, accelerate our academic progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| and one of the ways that we think we can do that is through the use of instructional technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| and, again, we had a lot of conversation about this last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| and you may remember we proposed a very broad initiative in instructional technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| putting the device in the hands of every kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| and every teacher in our school system at all 88 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| Well, obviously that did not get funded last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| so we thought we'd step back a little bit and start on a smaller scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| and so what we did this year is we instituted something called the School Technology Challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| basically an internal competition in order to identify a smaller number of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| where we could put that instructional technology in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| and see the success that we know that it will engender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| and then hopefully build on that success over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| We think that having that instructional technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| obviously technology is never going to replace a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| but that technology is something that can be used as a tool by a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8876)|
| 2:28:02| as a resource by a teacher to help them provide even more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| and engaging and differentiated instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| So those are our four priorities, and I gave you the long version of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| The short version of those four priorities are talented teachers, effective teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8891)|
| 2:28:17| instructional technology, and student safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| or even the shorter version is teachers, teaching technology, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| Those are the four priorities that are in this budget, and this is a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| It's a more conservative budget than was proposed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| It's, as I said, about a $13 million increase or just over 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| That's about one-fourth of what we asked for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| So we feel like it's a more conservative budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| but it certainly integrates the important priorities that the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| and our community have identified for education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| and I think it's an important investment in our children, in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| in our community, and in our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| and I appreciate the support of the county commission in appropriating these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| Hang in there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| I think we'll probably have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| No lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| First, from my standpoint, I appreciate your response to my questions that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| about a few specific items, and I don't have much to follow up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| but I did have a couple of additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| One area of, and it's always a concern, of course, the proportion of your budget that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8972)|
| 2:29:41| and it's a very difficult thing to get a grasp of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| but what is devoted to what we call administrative functions versus classroom functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| So you sent me a list of supervisors and directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8991)|
| 2:29:56| and my only additional question to that was in terms of hierarchy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| that structure of directors and supervisors, who would be above that level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9002)|
| 2:30:10| Above the level of director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| and supervisor would really only be the assistant superintendent level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| and then the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| And how many assistant superintendents are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9019)|
| 2:30:20| So we have two assistant superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| and then a chief accountability officer that are sort of at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| So three positions total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Let me take a look at the list here and make sure I have that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| But I believe over, in fact, it may only be the two positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9035)|
| 2:30:41| the actual assistant superintendents that are not listed as directors or supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| Yeah, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9047)|
| 2:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9048)|
| 2:30:49| And, of course, my position as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| In the attachment where you had contracts with private agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9051)|
| 2:30:59| did you have another addition there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| Mr. Oaks reminds me that he's not in that position, in that list either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| He's not a supervisor or director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| Chief of Staff is in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| In your attachment for contracts with private agencies, just a couple of questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9071)|
| 2:31:16| One, you had Distinguished Professional Educational Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| It's actually a fairly innovative initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| Basically what it is is that's an organization that works with us to identify professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9087)|
| 2:31:37| who might serve as sort of adjunct instructors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| The state of Tennessee, working with the Distinguished Professionals Education Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| developed an adjunct teacher's license in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| which is fairly unique around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| And so what it allows is a scientist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| can come and get an adjunct license and teach an advanced physics course, one course a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9117)|
| 2:32:04| or someone who's a professional in computer science could come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| and teach one course in computer science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| So it allows us some flexibility to utilize some really expert potential instructors in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9132)|
| 2:32:19| where we have needs, and it's usually just a one-off kind of a course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| or an advanced course that those types of folks are able to fill the need for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| Okay, so you have $256,000 in that line item for that type of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9147)|
| 2:32:34| How many people would we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| I mean, how many do we have now as opposed to what you foresee maybe in the next budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9156)|
| 2:32:42| Yeah, I'll have to check on the numbers for you and get the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| It actually will go down a little bit because we've also supplemented some of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| with some of the Race to the Top dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| And so we'll actually see a bit of a decrease in that spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| But I can get you the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| I want to say it's not a huge number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| It might be 50 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| But I'll get you the exact numbers so we have the specific details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| And then there was a category there in the same attachment that was Gallup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| 49,000 teacher insight and survey application system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9196)|
| 2:33:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| That's the Gallup survey organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| And actually they provide two services for us that are they have two products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9203)|
| 2:33:30| One is called Teacher Insight and the other is called Principal Insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9210)|
| 2:33:35| And they are a survey instrument that they use for perspective candidates for our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9215)|
| 2:33:43| And they are statistically, they have shown that by asking a series of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9223)|
| 2:33:50| they can actually help give a statistical probability of future success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| in both the principalship in terms of leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| and in terms of teachers in terms of their instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| And so it's one tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9241)|
| 2:34:02| It's not the only tool, obviously, that we use in looking at perspective candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| But it adds another data point for us as we go through the hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| That's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9252)|
| 2:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| Other questions, commissioners, for Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9258)|
| 2:34:19| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9259)|
| 2:34:20| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9260)|
| 2:34:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9261)|

| 2:34:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| We're finished with this portion of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| We have a public hearing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| Let's take a few minutes break and we'll come back for the public hearing shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| Please see if there are people here to make public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| We've got one here and I've got four signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| I have Mr. Spencer's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9319)|
| 2:35:25| I don't have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| That's another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9327)|
| 2:35:28| Anybody else here to speak at public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| We've got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| So we've got two folks here for public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| You want to go ahead with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| I need to be with my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| I'm the keeper of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| Is that okay with the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9348)|
| 2:35:49| We go ahead with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9349)|
| 2:35:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| Is there something going on at Gibbs Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| No, I wanted to do that last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| I've got to do it three times, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9360)|
| 2:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| Five-thirty to seven-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| Fourth program at seven-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| Who's going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| Are you ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9374)|
| 2:36:19| And I bet Mike McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9379)|
| 2:36:27| Also maybe school board member Mike McMillan and at-large commission members Mike Hammond and Ed Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9387)|
| 2:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| My name is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| 720 Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| I'm the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Volunteer Lodge 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| representing law enforcement here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| I come before you tonight to speak for a public hearing on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| I'd remind commission that we talked about a couple of years ago the gap in pay for our public safety personnel in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9414)|
| 2:37:06| At the time, I believe we stated that the road deputies, your average guys out there answering the calls 24-7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9426)|
| 2:37:14| and providing public safety were 21 percent behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| And the corrections officers, the folks managing our inmate population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| and our offender population were, at that time, 39 percent behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9444)|
| 2:37:30| I know we had a three percent raise that following January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9450)|
| 2:37:36| And there was a lot of talk about addressing the problem, doing a salary survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9456)|
| 2:37:42| seeing where we are and coming up with a plan to start fixing that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| I haven't seen any of that salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| I haven't seen any action on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| I appreciate I spoke with the mayor about it because I believe it's a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9476)|
| 2:38:00| I know there are a lot of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| I understand that you're dealing with a complex bit of stuff, but this is a potentially big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| They're getting so far behind that it's going to be near impossible to start addressing it in any sort of meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9489)|
| 2:38:19| I would ask that as you're going through the budget this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| I know the mayor has planned, I think, for two percent for county employees other than the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| I know we heard Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| I guess they're getting a step and then they're budgeting for one and a half and one percent at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| I would ask for a larger percentage immediately in this budget for our public safety personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9518)|
| 2:38:48| I think it's prudent to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9528)|
| 2:38:52| And I would ask that we go ahead and do that salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9532)|
| 2:38:57| The employees took notice of that when commission talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| and they put a lot of hopes and stuff on that because they know they're real far behind and they're hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9540)|
| 2:39:05| And, you know, from what I've found, I guess there's been a salary survey done, but it didn't include the public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9545)|
| 2:39:12| So two years ago we told these folks, hey, we acknowledge that you're so far behind, it's crazy, we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9552)|
| 2:39:19| And we told them we're going to set aside money to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9559)|
| 2:39:22| We've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9562)|
| 2:39:23| We've excluded them from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| And we're letting them get farther behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| This is something we need to do something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| So whatever means you have to do something about that would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9573)|
| 2:39:39| I know these guys are reasonable, hardworking people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| They understand the dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| But they have needs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| They have families, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| They go to the gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| They go to the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| They're struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9590)|
| 2:39:51| They're hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| So anything you can do on that 2% would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9593)|
| 2:39:57| And we anxiously await that salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| And, you know, we're reasonable folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9603)|
| 2:40:06| We'll look at whatever period of years it takes to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| But ignoring the problem doesn't mean there's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| It doesn't mean the problem fixes itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| It's actually just getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| So I would respectfully ask this commission to go back to that two years conversation we had a little while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9620)|
| 2:40:29| and make plans to ensure that that salary survey for your employees is conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9629)|
| 2:40:36| and that we start looking at where we stand on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| and coming up with some way to move forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9639)|
| 2:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Where are we on the salary survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Salary survey is complete, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| For the uniformed bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9656)|
| 2:40:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9657)|
| 2:40:58| That has to be done through the sheriff's council system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| My understanding is they're going to do one in conjunction with us probably in October again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| Our salary survey that we did a few months ago actually, and I let Joan speak to this actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9670)|
| 2:41:18| but it was we didn't get a lot of responses, and we were told it was because of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9678)|
| 2:41:25| And so we are going to do a survey again in, I think, about October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9685)|
| 2:41:32| And I think I talked to Allison Rogers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| and I think they're going to try to do one with the merit board around the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| They're going to do it for my birthday, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9706)|
| 2:41:49| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| That's been a very high concern of mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| And so we will be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| You can rest assured that that's not something that's going to slip by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| We're going to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| Because I think our finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| and our human resources department have done a really good job based on what we did get back from the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| Even though it was not complete or not all the information we wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| it was enough that they were able to come up with a really good two-year plan for raising up the lowest paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9738)|
| 2:42:24| up to where, closer to where they ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| And I think that they will work just as hard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| with the sheriff's department to make that happen for them as quickly as possible too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| But I was also very disappointed that the sheriff's department salary survey didn't happen at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9754)|
| 2:42:40| But I understand it's got to be done through the merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| So it's going to happen, and we're going to move on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9768)|
| 2:42:49| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9770)|
| 2:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| Mr. Spencer, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| Ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9777)|

| 2:43:42| And he's certainly a committed and convicted citizen towards this topic of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9822)|
| 2:43:52| Especially convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| He's convicted about a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130520?start=9834)|
