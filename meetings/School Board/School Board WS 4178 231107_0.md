| 0:00:24| followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Miss Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=24)|
| 0:00:30| I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=30)|
| 0:00:45| which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=45)|
| 0:00:57| Board members, I want to remind you that you have been invited to the annual Reach Them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=57)|

| 0:01:11| And thank you to everyone who's in attendance tonight. I just want to remind you that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| is the board's public business meeting to discuss items that come before us for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| We would ask that you be respectful and courteous at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| and please be mindful that sound carries very easily in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| So if you need to speak to your neighbor or take a phone call, just step outside of the room to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| Also, we have appointed board members to the Strategic Planning Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=92)|
| 0:01:36| so thank you to those who express interest in serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| The committee will be Reverend Butler, Christy Christie, and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| and two staff members, Corey Lautner and Steve Rutner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| Steve Rutter, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| So I will work with Terry on kind of coordinating our schedules to get our first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| planned and also get an agenda before we nominate a chair for that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| Moving on, are there any requested changes to the meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=122)|
| 0:02:10| Okay, motion by Ms. Horne, second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Okay, Dr. Reislick, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| For many years, I have made it a point to regularly spend a half day visiting classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| I think I've done that for the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| and it's always great to get out there and kind of see teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| and the way we talk about it as a team is how do you pulse the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| You know, how do you know the decisions you're making are happening in a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| or not happening in a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| So it's always great to have conversations with the folks on the ground who are actually doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| and they're always pretty honest to tell you, so that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| We believe important work happens in the central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| but we also think the classroom is where the core and heart of our mission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| So with that in mind, I was excited this past week to be able to visit Cedar Bluff Pre-K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| preschool, so that was a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| They're really small, but it was a lot of fun to spend the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| I'm a little big, so it was a lot of fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| but I got to spend there with Ms. Samantha Hobbs and Ms. Jo Lynch and their rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| but April Parton actually took me around to every classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| got to spend time in there and just hear some of their needs and some of what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| but I'd say the most powerful thing that I saw that I just wanted to talk about for a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| was a co-taught classroom, and for those of you who don't know what co-taught is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| that's a special ed teacher beside a regular ed teacher and three teaching assistants in that class of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| And just to be able to see their work, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| they had eight of the kids of the 20 students in their class that were actually suspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| potentially and being evaluated just for their needs that they may potentially have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| and some of those more severe than others, but you saw them together in a classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| and you saw just the miraculous tag outs of teachers when it was the right time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| You saw the tag out between the special education certified teacher and the regular ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| just in the lesson in and of itself, like didn't miss a beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| I mean, it wasn't a, it was just step up, turn, next person stepped up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| okay, now, you know, grab a, they were looking at shapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| grab another thing out of this bag and tell us what shape that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| So it was kind of seamless how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| They knew each student's needs, each student's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| what their strategies were to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Watch one student who was having some issues in behavior that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| turn something over and then just work with that student through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| through different signals and things that he knew to calm back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| And actually within two minutes was picking up and correcting his behaviors that he had done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| So it was just neat to hear from them and their understanding for every student in their regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| ed or one is suspected for some other supports needed that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| they see the vision for them or what they can be one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| One teacher told me a story about her individual personal child that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| was a lot like some of those students who is now a sophomore at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| And just to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| So, you know, sometimes I think every story matters and being able to be in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| and see that happen, but see that happen in our pre-K that this board has made such a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| I have great hope for what we're going to be able to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| So I just want to share that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| At this time, I'm going to turn over to assistant superintendent Jason Myers of student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| to give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| It's been a few months since we've heard about progress in the student success deep dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| Thank you, Dr. Ryswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| I thought I had more time to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| That was a quick superintendent's update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| So I know it's been a few months since I last addressed the board on special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| So I'm happy to share an update on the progress our department has made on our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| To support the project, I've launched internal working groups comprised of KCS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| These groups are focused on developing guidance on practices to promote a culture of collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| and ensure decisions are made by those closest to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| We recognize also that meaningful change cannot happen in a vacuum, nor can we go at this alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| Real cultural change takes time and willingness to build a coalition around the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Tonight, I'm also announcing two tangible steps we have taken to follow through on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| commitment that I made to our board and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| First, we are launching a standing special education council to provide input and perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| to our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| To honor the work of our task force, each member has been invited to be part of that council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| In addition to those members, we will also have representation from gen ed teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| special education teachers, as well as school and district leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| We have also launched the student success leadership council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| This council will be comprised of school principals and will give input and perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| to the project through the lens of our school leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| These groups will not operate in silos and will play a vital role in our work as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| Each council will serve as a sounding board for ideas that emerge from the internal working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| groups and provide us with actionable feedback toward progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| It is our hope that each of these councils will have their first meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| the first week of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Over the next two months, I plan to share additional updates with the board and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| In December, I will provide the board with an update on our ESS contract, which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| a great asset to our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| It has allowed us to fill vacancies with a high level of efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| Also, I plan to introduce our candidate for the student success advisory and improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| officer position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| And then finally, I will update the board on our educator input portal, which is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| to gather additional feedback from teachers, service providers, and our school and district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Finally, in January, I will announce the foundational elements of the KCS way for special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| education and outline our long-term plan for cultural change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| As we continue this process, it's important to recognize that there are no quick fixes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| To truly change organizational culture takes time and hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| We will stay the course, cast our vision, and build our coalition to support this important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Dr. Reisman, that concludes my update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| I just want to say I've been able to sit at the table with Mr. Myers as he's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| processed a lot of that information that's come in and I appreciate his approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| He actually came to me saying, you know, we don't want to just do the minimum we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| to so people feel like we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=492)|

| 0:08:24| Final two things I'll say, Madam Chair, is as we move into the holidays, November is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| a month of thanks and I don't know that we'll gather again and may have a chance to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| this but I want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I want to say thank you first to you all as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| You guys have been very supportive of the work that we're trying to do for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=517)|

| 0:08:46| You guys take it very seriously and want what's best for both and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| I also want to thank our staff and our students, just all staff that are there because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| all matter to our students and make a difference just for supporting where we're headed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| a district and families as well for the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| So no matter what you are, principal, custodian, or any one of those other, please, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| if you are hearing this, consider writing a note to those folks who make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| to your students every day or stop them in a car line and just take a second to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| them because it is, as I said earlier, difficult work but it's also very rewarding work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| And then my final tonight is I'm very excited tomorrow to visit Hardin Valley Academy for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| our honoring service event to recognize veterans and members of our Guard Reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| I'll say this as a son of a veteran who was in the Army for 21 years, the military and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| serving the country has always meant a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Grew up in that situation and I think it's incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| So this is an exciting event that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| This event is a chance for us to celebrate and our recent recognition on the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| of defense with the Employer Freedom Award that will be there on display for folks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| be able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| But also, more importantly, we've invited employees who are Guard and Reserve employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| as well as veterans to be honored who also serve on the KCS staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| These employees have demonstrated a deep commitment to service both in the military and with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| at KCS and we're determined to make them know that their sacrifice is recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| Looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow who can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| It's going to be a wonderful event and we're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| With that, Madam Chair, I'll conclude my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you, Dr. Reislich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| I'm looking forward to tomorrow too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I think it's going to be a great day of thanks for our staff for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| Dr. Adams, do you have a custodial staffing update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Madam Chair, members of the board, so currently out of our 398 positions, we have 81 vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| leaving us with 317 field positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Nine of our schools are at 50% or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| But we also have 47 facilities that are fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=647)|
| 0:10:47| I had a couple of questions if that was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| When custodians apply for jobs, do they have to pay to apply for those jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| They do not have to pay to apply, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And I'll let, I see Jennifer reaching for her, I'll let her get into the HR questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| They do not have to pay to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=666)|
| 0:11:06| I was curious, like when they take drug tests, do they pay for that aspect of it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Madam Chair, like Dr. Adams said, there's no cost to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| But if a candidate is, a custodial candidate or otherwise, is recommended for a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| there are some costs with those pre-employment screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=684)|
| 0:11:24| I was thinking, and this is just an idea for recruitment and retention is, and the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| that I brought up drug tests specifically is maybe if it comes back as a negative drug test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| I was thinking maybe KCS could eat that cost for those employees in a way to help retain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=694)|
| 0:11:43| And then I just was also curious, for the custodians who do end up quitting, do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| ever, is there exit interviews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Do they give reasons to why they end up leaving the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| So there are exit interviews sent to every employee that submits a resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| And then obviously the HR and talent teams would review those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| There are not a lot of custodial staff that have submitted exit interviews to review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| And just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| So the job listings for custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| So I know that a lot of job listings are done by individual locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Is that the case for custodians also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Madam Chair, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So custodians, we operate through a pool posting, which we do for a couple of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| job categories as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| And we have done custodial postings both ways in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| So by specific school location and by pool posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| And while, when you go to the website and see our vacancies, it looks like there's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| custodial position because there's one posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| We have seen more success that way though, because it allows all candidates to be housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| in one specific posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| And it allows a discussion between the custodial operations department and the candidates as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| to the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| So they're not searching for one specific location on the website and may not be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| of different locations within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| So it allows for that dialogue on options for specific openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=800)|
| 0:13:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Thanks for all your work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Mr. Triplett, do you have a legislative update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Lots of updates, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Good times for updates, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Our TSBA leadership and convention is on the 16th through the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| And so there are a number of resolutions up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| There are 11 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| And I'm just going to briefly kind of summarize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| The TSBA Board of Directors has given a, they have a recommendation for each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| They recommend we either approve it or they oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| So I'm just going to kind of summarize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| And they're all available in the packet in front of you to read in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| But the first one is appreciation for the TSBA president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| The second one is clarification of qualifications for the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| The third one is supporting special school districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| The fourth one is a modification of the letter grading system of public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| The fifth one opposes partisan election of school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| And the sixth one is funding for special education preschool students in the TISA formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| And the Board of Directors recommends that they approve all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| They recommend all those be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Number seven is a resolution supporting granting of temporary permits for teachers of courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| for which an end of course examination is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| And the Board of Directors takes no position on that one, which I thought was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Number eight is one that is familiar to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| It's to allow school districts to make retention decisions for third and fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| And that is something that the TSBA Board of Directors recommends be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Number nine is a resolution requiring dual administration of the English language arch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| portion of the Tennessee Ready Test for third grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| And the Board of Directors opposes that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Number 10 is a constitutional amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| You'll have to take time to read through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| But they recommend that be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| And then number 11 is a resolution to include individual threats of acts of violence on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| school grounds or school related activity be considered a violation of the zero tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| And the Board of Directors opposes that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| So, again, those are the resolutions that will be up for discussion at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| Obviously, all that information is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| You'll have, you can look through that and figure out kind of where you're, where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| stand on it, what you support, what you oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| But at least that gives you an idea at least where they stand on those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| So that concludes my update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Well, we will move on to the regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| We'll start with items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| C, one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Any questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| I had discussed this with Ms. Horn just briefly before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| And we are waiting on a revised version of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| So I don't know if the one that's on there was marked up by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| So we are waiting on a clean copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| It's number three with the East Tennessee natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| So I thought we'd already had it last week, but apparently it did not come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1007)|
| 0:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| So just to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Hopefully we'll get it before Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1025)|
| 0:17:05| I had a question on number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| How do we currently track dual enrollment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| In a variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| I think a lot of it is back to just our standard system of ASPEN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| This agreement with Overgrad is really about looking at the data that we have around students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| and student subgroups that are participating and have access to dual enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| And through that data agreement, they will do some coaching and things to help us look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| at opportunities for expanding access to additional dual enrollment opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Will it be able to show us that information by institution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| It should be able to, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| That would be one of the goals is to see, again, which not only who's accessing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| but also those different quality levels, I guess, as you would look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| More technical versus more traditional academic type courses and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| I was still taking notes on the TSBA stuff and missed item one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| No, you were just, you were popping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| On item one, does that single page constitute the whole report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| Because it's not much of a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| I thought for sure there's got to be more pages to this compliance report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1111)|
| 0:18:31| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| That's all there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| Dr. Eisling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Yeah, it's more of a formality that we do every year that looks at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| And Andrew's run down and checked with all the departments to make sure they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| compliant with the things that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| And this is just the form that we send back to the state saying that it's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| I'm sure if there was a corrective action that needed to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| there would be more documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| But since there is none, then it's a single page, real clean, sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| I want to think back, because I used to do some of this when I was in my other role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| But there was one time that I think we hadn't updated a policy yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| because it was like in first or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Terry probably remembers that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| So we had to report that we haven't updated this certain policy yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| Usually we kind of tell on ourselves if there's something that's not caught up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| and report that on the front side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| But we're not aware of any this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1164)|
| 0:19:24| So because it's a single page, in our view, we're in full compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1168)|
| 0:19:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Mr. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Dr. Rozett, when you said that, that made me think of the threat assessment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| So wouldn't that be one that is in reading right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| I know you've made some changes to that as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Some small changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Do you want to speak to that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1191)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| So yeah, I took a look at that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Ms. Owen actually reached out to me and expressed that she thought it was a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| And it basically is a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| There was some language that's supposed to be pulled from the statute itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| So I've corrected that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| And I mean, it does look like it's from the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| And I would say, I don't know exactly when the compliance report is due, but the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1214)|
| 0:20:25| So technically, the board could be in compliance by the time it's sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| depending on how the vote goes for that threat assessment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| We would need to approve that in first reading then, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Seven or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Eight, nine or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1249)|
| 0:20:59| 11 or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| 13 or 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1264)|

| 0:21:19| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1282)|
| 0:21:22| Moving on to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| 6A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1285)|

| 0:21:42| H or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Yes, Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| I know in policy review regarding H, I think Mr. Watson had recommended a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1309)|
| 0:21:58| And I was wondering if we are going to also change the title of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Mr. Watson had recommended a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| And I was wondering if we are going to also change the title of that, or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1324)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1333)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| I just wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| But once it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Then it will be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| On to I or J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1345)|

| 0:22:39| O or P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Q, R or S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| And these were discussed in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| So there was discussion, robust discussion on all of these policies a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1375)|
| 0:22:55| Moving on to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| On A, is there any substantive change from what we had originally planned for that submission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| And just for the public, we're talking about the ESSER 3.0 grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Mr. Watson, I'll let Ms. Himmelgarn go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I'm just saying it should give you much more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| But I want to give you guys kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| I think I might...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1408)|
| 0:23:28| We might put this in the update too, but just say it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| So part of this is we're in our third year of the ESSER spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| And, you know, the three years out, you kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| There's some money kind of gets bucketed without clear direction of what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| There may be, you know, $3 million for literacy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Like those kinds of things that we look at and what we've really worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| And Ms. Himmelgarn, I'm probably stealing all the words you're getting ready to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| But what we've asked them to do, of course, through this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| was work with the finance team and kind of look at where do we have some margins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| and how can we pull those dollars and move them into like capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| so we can start spending that before so we make sure we spend the dollars down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| So I just want to say overall, that's kind of the theory behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| But I know Ms. Himmelgarn can answer questions specifically too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes, you did steal most of my words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| So there were personnel...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Places where personnel was allocated dollars in ESSER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| where the personnel vacant...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Where there were personnel vacancies, there was additional spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Where the state or federal dollars...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| I guess an opportunity for funds came available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| where we weren't anticipating when we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| So the Grow Your Own initiative, we had budgeted some money in the ESSER budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| towards similar initiatives that there was then a different avenue to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| So those dollars were redirected towards capital projects and technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| Yeah, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| So because this is such a multi...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| I mean, it's been multiple years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| and a lot of people are aware of the initial money that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| I just wanted to make it clear that we're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| In this grant application, we're not greatly varying from our original strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| There might be some nuance and some detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| but we're still trying to accomplish basically the same things, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1512)|
| 0:25:12| We're still trying to accomplish the same things, still have the same priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| Did not end up spending all the money that we allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| towards some of those or redirecting some of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| I think where there was a question last time too, this isn't for additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| This is just a reallocation of the funds that we were awarded in ESSER III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| All right, moving on to B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1549)|
| 0:25:49| On to contracts, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| Those are the only contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| All right, on to nine regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| And board members, you did receive an email earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| with the finalized charter school agreement that's being considered for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| So is there any discussion on item 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Is there a required timeline for having this agreement passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1576)|
| 0:26:27| Dr. Weiswig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1589)|
| 0:26:29| I think I'm going to, I'll probably talk to Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| I'll pass it to Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| He'll probably have Ms. Nixon speak, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| And that's actually exactly what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| So if Ms. Nixon wouldn't mind coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| There are some time sensitive elements, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Hello, Teresa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1606)|
| 0:26:46| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Good evening, Madam Chair, Dr. Weiswig and members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| We do have some timelines that we do have to follow according to our authorizing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| It is not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| It is just high quality authorizing standards that it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| completed after the application 60 days, which would be October 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| So with that in mind, we didn't get any of this documentation until this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1641)|
| 0:27:34| It doesn't seem like there's time for us to do our due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| to have a discussion about this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And there's certainly not time for the public to be aware of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| I've really only had time to look at a couple of pages and I have quite a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1667)|
| 0:27:57| Looking at the whereas section, the fourth whereas paragraph talks about meeting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| best interests of the students, the district, or the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| That language seems problematic to me because it implies that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| interested in meeting someone's interests besides those of the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| And Mr. Dupler, if you could look at the last paragraph on the first page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| where it says the charter school has the power to contract buyer lease property and the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| to borrow funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| If a charter were to borrow funds and then to default on that borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| do we become liable for those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1721)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I would say only if the district is a co-signer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| When they buy or lease property, do they have to follow the county purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| Do they have to go through county purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Do they have to follow the same regulations as we would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| No, it's my understanding that due to their status as a separate entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| they would not have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| And of course, this board, through the charter, is bound to the county purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1765)|
| 0:29:25| So, they could purchase a large piece of property that we might end up stuck with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1765)|
| 0:29:34| Or a building that we might end up stuck with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| I don't know that, I don't understand your question, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| So, they could make a purchase without following procurement guidelines, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| And then, let's say they left for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| we would then be stuck with whatever property that was, having to dispose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| No, that would still be their responsibility to, you know, if they defaulted or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| whatever happened would be their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| So, I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| On page two, it talks about the promise of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| On page two, it talks about the promises contained herein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Would that include language in the whereas section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Because there are several places where it talks about ensuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| different things in that whereas section, and I wonder if each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| would be part of the language that is considered a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| A whereas is simply a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| So, although it's something that, you know, a court could look to try and ascertain intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1846)|
| 0:30:55| it is not something that one can point to to say you have to follow this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| like you do in the enumerated terms, number one, and follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| And then, I'm not sure who the next question would be to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Looking at section 1.1, talking about waivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| we know that charter schools can request multiple kinds of waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Has this charter given any indication of waivers that they intend to request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1884)|
| 0:31:37| Does anyone know of any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1899)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you, Ms. Henderson, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Okay, Ms. Nixon would probably know that because she's the one who interfaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| and I know Mr. Dupler and you guys met and talked with their attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| working on this contract recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| So, I don't know if either you or Ms. Nixon has any knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| Ms. Nixon, she's indicating no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| I can certainly tell you in our recent encounters with their attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| and Brad Scott, who was their point person, waivers were not discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1930)|
| 0:32:18| But frankly, we were focused on trying to finalize the terms for the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| Looking at 1.1, the last paragraph in 1.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| says, by signing this agreement, the chartering authority approves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| any waivers requested in the sponsor's application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| That seems like really problematic language to say that we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| approve waivers before they are requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| Is that required in the law, that we would necessarily approve their waivers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| So, it's my understanding that they've already submitted their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| So, I mean, we already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| I think this is speaking specifically to waiver applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| because they would make application to the state to waive different requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| And this seems to be saying that we would approve those requested waivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| when they apply for those waivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| What this is saying is that if they had waivers in their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| in their initial application, then this board would be approving those, if you sign this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2006)|
| 0:33:35| So, this has nothing to do with any future waivers they would request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2018)|
| 0:33:38| It says others subsequently requested are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| So, I mean, if they had any others, they would have to be attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| So, my question in terms of understanding, although it's not required by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| it is a best practice to do it in 60 days, and we haven't done it in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| So, can we do this at the next meeting in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| give us an opportunity to take a look at this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| And the reason why I ask that question is because I think from the perspective that I'm seeing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| we're not just agreeing to a contract this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| but what we agree to is going to carry on to subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| And so, to do this with just a few days to look at this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| I think it may not be a due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| giving it a full review as well as having the community a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| And so, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Could we do this at the next board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| Yeah, Ms. Nixon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| Thank you for the question, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| The thing is, we as a board, a charter authorizing authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| have already approved the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| So, essentially, the agreement is just the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| This agreement is in line with the current Emerald Agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| plus any amendments that have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| I also went back and met with, because it had been nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| with all of the groups, the different departments within the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| to ensure that their portion sounded correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| because Emerald's agreement will be up for renewal in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| And so, I said, let's invest the time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| to get the best agreement for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| And so, we feel like we're in a really good place with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| We have had a few months of meetings to try to work this out legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| to ensure that everything was updated, all the laws were updated, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| And so, the only purpose of delaying it would just be delaying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| I mean, the goal is to get it approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| since we've already approved the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you for your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I think that the advantage for me would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| and I'm sure that those who've worked on it legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| and also within the statute know more about it than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| but still, I'm being asked to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| And so, I want to make sure what I approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| is what I understand is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| And quite honestly, I think I had some real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| with the application that never was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| And I want to make sure that the contract or the agreement we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| is going to ensure that whatever those issues were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| that we're going to have something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| to make sure that they're not a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Particularly, the information that we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| from the previous efforts of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| was inconsistent with the state data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| And we never did see any way that that was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| There was no justification made that the state made to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| hey, they're right and we're wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| or this is how it's being done instead of the way they explained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| It was just, we voted on it without having that resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| So, when we look at an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| we're saying you're going to operate in accordance with the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| but the application itself was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| So, how do we know that going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| we're going to get accurate data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Because the data that you see in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| was not accurate per what the state was reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| And I asked the question of our superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| and I said, okay, if we have a data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| that is not consistent with what the state has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| do we do something to make sure that our data match theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| or their data match ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| And his response was, yes, we do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| We don't just report it our way and say the state's where it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| And that's what happened with the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I think the minutes will reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| So, with this agreement, we're being asked to agree to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| And I just want to make sure as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I haven't had a chance to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| and I just have to read it because we got it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| So, I could possibly look at it between now and Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| but I don't think that I should have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| We had 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I haven't had 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I haven't had six days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| So, I think that it would be good if we had an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| Now, other board members may disagree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| But I just believe if you're going to ask me to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I need to have an opportunity to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| And take a look at what you've done, all the work you've put in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| but take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Ms. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I want to be sure the board notices that in 1.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| it says that we are being asked to approve an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| that goes through June 30th, 2035.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| We're not talking about a short-term agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| We're not talking about something small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| And the fact that we've approved anything prior to this is irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| And that the staff has had months of meetings is irrelevant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| because this board has the responsibility of doing the due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| of knowing what's in this before we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| And we haven't had time to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| because we weren't given the information in any kind of appropriate timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| We've been talking about that for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| We keep coming back over and over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| to things that either are not on the agenda in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| or that we don't have time to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| And here we are with the exact same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| something we got just literally hours ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| and we're being expected to approve it through 2035.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| That doesn't seem reasonable to me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2414)|
| 0:40:14| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| I agree with Reverend Butler and Jennifer Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| Getting this just a few hours ago, and this one is 16 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| And again, like others said, this is for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| It makes me really nervous to vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| that I haven't gotten the chance to thoroughly read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| I've barely been able to skim this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| I really would like the time to be able to thoroughly read through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| so that I can feel confident in voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| I think that that would be really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| I'm curious what took it so long to get to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| and why we didn't have it when the agenda was published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you, Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| I'm happy to walk you through a brief timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| I actually wrote it out, so I would be looking for the dates and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| So my first day in this role was July 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| So obviously, you all had approved the application back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| My predecessor had gotten an agreement ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| and there were some questions, because it had been nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| of like, who actually should own this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Should this be written by Knox County Schools, the authorizing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| or should it be written by the charter school, like some of our MOUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| and be brought to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And so that was one of the first things I had to do some investigation on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| because this was all new for me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| And in July, after one of our first meetings with the State Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| I asked that question, and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| oh, certainly, as the authorizing district, you want to own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| And they said, imagine Memphis-Shelby with 53 charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| The school district wants to have the same language with all 53,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| and not 53 different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| And I said, that completely makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Now I've learned something new for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| And so then, I'll be honest, it was the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| People are on vacation, trying to coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| And so then on August 7th, Gary and I met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| and we went through, what are the next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| And as I took the agreement that had been drafted at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| we noticed that some of the amendments that had occurred on the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Emerald one had not been updated in that version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| So I said, if we're really working hard on this one to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| I'm spending all the hours in Gary's office now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| when we do this again, potentially for Emerald in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| when the renewal comes up, let's invest the time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| So I took the time to go back around and meet with ELL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Transportation, all the departments, basically then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| And then on September 5th, we sent, so that was about a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| that it took to catch up with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| September 5th, we sent, emailed the first version to Knoxville Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| and sent it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Their lawyers sent back to us their legal representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| sent us edits on September 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Gary and I met on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Actually, the day before you all went to board prep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| or had your board retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| It was that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| We have been conversing back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| And finally, we just got to the point that we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| let's sit down in a room and try to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| where everybody stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| Because of the fact that sometimes you can't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| the context via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| And between fall break, summer, vacations, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| I will own part of it as the transitioning in new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| That was all new for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Gary and Keith were there to be able to sit down with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| At 2 o'clock, to actually finalize the parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| that we made it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you for explaining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| It definitely helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| But I think, I believe, some of our conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| which I wasn't there for, but I did watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| The summer was about having time to look at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| And when it happens that something gets to us last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| and things like that, with the idea of having our voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| meeting not take hours long, that I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| is one of those examples that we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| going to have more questions and more conversation on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| So I'm curious if that's a consideration of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| that meaningful conversation on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| and potentially not exactly being prepared for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| or pushing it off for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| I would love to have more time than just Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Did you have, Mr. Diepler, did you want to add in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Well, I mean, Teresa's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| She's taken notes and got the whole timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| So I mean, she's got it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| But I would add that once we got in a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| and just with the scheduling and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| it took until last Friday to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| We were able to finalize the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| And Knox Prep asked to put this on the board's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| And frankly, I mean, all three of us and Keith Wilson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| was there, too, said, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| the board may question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| But, you know, and they said, OK, fine, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| go ahead and put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| And so we're willing to do whatever the board's will is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| So that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Thanks, Mr. Diepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2747)|
| 0:45:47| Not to nuance this to death, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| have a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And I understand that there's been a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| of work to get to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| The current document we have says updated on 11-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| which was Thursday this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| It should read 11-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| OK, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Because you all mentioned still changing some things on 11-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| But it says 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| And if it was 11-3, and again, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| just asking from a technical standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Like, I'm not sure that I'm overly concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Is there a reason why we didn't get it on Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| If it was done on Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| So it was late by the time, late on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| by the time we got it finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| And Teresa and I both were going over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| making sure that all the, because what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| happened on Friday was about eight other edits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| And we had done probably 20 or so total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| So we were making sure that all the edits were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| taken care of and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| It was after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| So we weren't going to ask Ms. Coteney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| to send it out after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| And then we went over it again this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| So that was just to make sure that we had the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Yeah, I do think it would be good to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| to where it says update 11-3, if that truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| is when it was last updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| And I mean, to me, I like to have more time with things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| I know I haven't had a chance to read it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| I do think this is an important thing for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| I don't think any of us want to be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| where we're feeling, we know that you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| asking us to do this, but we don't want to feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| nor do we want the public to feel like we're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| asked to just approve things just to approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| And certainly having more time would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| And you all already acknowledged that when you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| hey, they're probably going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2861)|
| 0:47:41| why didn't we get more time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| But I do think that would be good in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Yeah, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| Is there a reason, if we delay this another 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| is that put them behind on some things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Is that create a situation where they're late on their processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and what they want to do moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| The only thing that it does not allow is really for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| to begin my oversight with them and their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| Because we do not have an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| I don't feel I have the responsibility or the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| to step in on your behalf to speak into any processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| they have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And so when we start looking at the pre-opening checklist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| they are already working through securing a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| and starting to find students and those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| some of their recruitment and application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| But the only difference is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| I can't step in and ask all the questions on your behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| that I could once I feel an agreement is finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| The only thing I would say is we got on Thursday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Wednesday night, we got 2,800 pages of documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| to be ready to read and discuss on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| I mean, this is 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I think we can read it in a couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| and then come ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| I mean, I think it's fair if we don't have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| to read it before the meeting and you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| to come and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| But I think we got 28 and we had four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| We got 16 in the next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I think we can make that happen if it would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| provide us with a sort of liaison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| to help give us oversight into what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| And I do have a quick question, then I'll get to Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Is there anything special or different in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| than the state law requires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| It almost mirrors, to my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| the NREL contract, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| That we already have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| It mirrors the Emerald contract with all of the legal updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| And then additionally, we took recent Tennessee State Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Commission contracts that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| been doing at the state level and really literally set them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| side by side and walked through them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| to ensure that we were not only in alignment with Emerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| but also had everything updated in accordance with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3008)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| That was really kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| Which I think Ms. Nixon answered when she first got up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| was that my assumption would be, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| wanted to ask that question too, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| that this would be mostly state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| and then also would be a mirror of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| that we have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| So between what you've said and what you've indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| I would agree with Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| I think that it would be helpful if board members have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| ready on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| And if we need to talk through those, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Because also, since you've just talked through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| it's fresh on your minds right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I think that's a great time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| And if that will help you, if it is helpful for you for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| to go ahead and approve it on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| it sounds like that may be more beneficial for our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| as far as time commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| So yeah, I agree with Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| I hope that we can discuss this on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| I agree, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Is there any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you, Ms. Nixon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Moving on to public forum, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| We have no public forum signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| OK, we'll move on to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Celeste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Regarding the invitation for you all to join,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| reach and teach them in these upcoming weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I think it'd be a great opportunity for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| to go out and meet the students who are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| working there for service hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| So for example, Beard and Key Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| will be there handing out all the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| handing out the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| And they would all love to talk to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| So I think it's a great opportunity for you all to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-231107?start=3123)|
