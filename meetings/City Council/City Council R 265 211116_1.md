| 2:28:48| So there are just a few things I want to say, and then I'm good with calling for the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| if there isn't anybody else who has comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| First of all, I want to say we have had some really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| I want to do a shout-out to the people who have been showing up, speaking on behalf of workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8942)|
| 2:29:10| and trying to get a good wage and speaking on behalf of the CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| I think we've done something by bringing this conversation out into the open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| and we've brought a lot of awareness to it, and I do not think that the conversation is over at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8959)|
| 2:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8968)|
| 2:29:33| I cannot ever imagine calling someone greedy if they ask for a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8973)|
| 2:29:48| I drew a line in the sand and said, if there's not a CBA, I'm going to vote no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8988)|
| 2:29:58| pretty much because I couldn't imagine that we wouldn't want to try to help the poor amongst us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8998)|
| 2:30:09| I know that we cannot solve everything, but we need to begin addressing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| and I think of this as a historic opportunity to begin addressing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9014)|
| 2:30:21| I am going to vote yes on this project. I have never said I was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9021)|
| 2:30:28| I will continue to work with the sports authority and try to get some agreements done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9028)|
| 2:30:38| I hope that everyone who has engaged so far continues, remains here as well to engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| This is an ongoing conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| As far as the city not paying a living wage, we need to, and I'm glad we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| But to say that, well, what about these people aren't doing it, we have to set a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| And I'm not going to say, well, they're not doing it, so it's okay for us to not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| We need to begin addressing a living wage all over this country, and I was excited about starting it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9068)|
| 2:31:17| That's all I've got to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| Thank you, Council Member Singh. Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| Yes. I've listened attentively throughout many, many meetings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9084)|
| 2:31:32| I have taken the votes that we made step by step, and every time that I voted, I felt comfortable with my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9092)|
| 2:31:43| And there's not a vote that I've made on this project that I regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| Unfortunately, I do not feel comfortable taking this vote at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9108)|
| 2:31:56| I think a two-week postponement would be very prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| Very often, well, let me preface this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9122)|
| 2:32:09| To me, the big issue that's being left unresolved is the community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9129)|
| 2:32:19| I'm getting more feedback from the public on that issue, very concerned citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9139)|
| 2:32:26| and it's people I've respected that have been involved in Knoxville communities and neighborhoods a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| and are wanting a clarification and a resolution about whether or not a community benefits agreement is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9153)|
| 2:32:47| I'm not ready to say it is or it's not, but what I think the most prudent thing to do is delay this for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9167)|
| 2:32:56| and have parties who have met once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| By all accounts, it was beneficial and it was cordial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| and Mr. Boyd said that he was willing to engage in those conversations again, and I have no doubt that he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9187)|
| 2:33:15| And simply, in the next two weeks, I don't think this is too much to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| to have Mr. Boyd to sit down with the labor unions, the urban league, whatever parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9201)|
| 2:33:28| and really get to the crux of this issue about the community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9208)|
| 2:33:36| And this is not something that we don't do routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| We did it tonight when parties, for example, on zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9220)|
| 2:33:46| we had an instance tonight where it was on the agenda, the parties were still talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| They were willing to talk and to resolve as many of the differences that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9233)|
| 2:34:00| To me, this is no different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| We do this routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| We've got two major parties here who have talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| Mr. Thomas, you can speak more into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| Who have both, by all accounts, have had one meeting that has been beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9249)|
| 2:34:17| I think we would be amiss not to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| Two weeks is not going to be a deal killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| There's a lot about this project that I like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| but I don't feel comfortable both in my mind and in the public's mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| not doing everything we can right now to resolve this community benefits agreement issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9276)|
| 2:34:46| to people's satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| And I could talk about several different things that have influenced me to make this kind of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9289)|
| 2:35:00| that leads me to, is this the issue that's the stumbling block for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| Because I did have a conversation, among other people, with one of the city council people in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| And if I summarize, they said that they didn't have a community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| when they did the Titan Stadium and it turned out to be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| They didn't have a community benefits agreement when they did the baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9321)|
| 2:35:27| and it turned out to be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| They finally got it right and decided we need a community benefits agreement with the soccer stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| And according to this one source, who was a city council person in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| it went smoothly, everything went ahead, they got that issue behind them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9341)|
| 2:35:45| and people felt a lot better about going forward and collaborating once they got that issue behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9345)|
| 2:35:53| So that, I think, is a prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9353)|
| 2:35:59| I think if we don't resolve that now, this issue is going to keep lingering around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9359)|
| 2:36:05| It's going to keep causing people hard feelings and doubts about where we're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9365)|
| 2:36:12| Now, you know, my starting point, and I've told everybody, including Mr. Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9372)|
| 2:36:18| in the first meeting we had, which was a very good meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| I will say I haven't had any question that I've had directly, not answered by Mr. Boyd, not answered by city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9381)|
| 2:36:29| You know, every question I've had has been responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9389)|
| 2:36:37| But I just think we're going to regret this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9397)|
| 2:36:47| I'm more and more comfortable with, even though my starting point, which is what I was about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| my starting point was I'm generally against publicly subsidizing professional sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9413)|
| 2:36:59| That was my starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| But I keep an open mind, of course, and we want to do what's best for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9422)|
| 2:37:08| and that's what I'm charged to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| And I've heard more and more good things about the benefits of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| I think it can do a lot of good things for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| And I'm inclined to approve it in the end, although I keep an open mind in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9439)|
| 2:37:29| But I do not feel comfortable going forward tonight until this issue that I've talked about is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9449)|
| 2:37:40| So I'm simply asking that we postpone this for two weeks, just like we did something else that happened on the agenda earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9460)|
| 2:37:49| like we routinely do when there's stakeholders who have been talking that haven't resolved the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9469)|
| 2:37:59| We give them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| Okay, so you're making a motion to postpone for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| Is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| Okay, the motion's been made to postpone this item for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| Is there further question or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| It's a priority motion, but it is debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| And the debate has to be limited to the subject of postponed versus not postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| Okay, thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| Ms. Parker, Mr. Smith, whose light was on, are both of you speaking to the postponement, only not to other specifics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9507)|
| 2:38:34| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| I can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| Thank you for making the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| I certainly support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| Thank you, Councilman Singh, for seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| I have so many more questions, and that's one reason why I support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9528)|
| 2:38:58| Even some of the points that my colleague, Councilman Smith, brought up about the 3% contribution, I'm so curious about those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9538)|
| 2:39:10| Because I wonder if it includes the public infrastructure work, if it includes the potential cost from the KUB work that could impact our constituents, the rate payers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9550)|
| 2:39:22| If it includes the contributions from KCDC to this project, these are all public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9562)|
| 2:39:30| And I feel like we need to, you know, this is our moment to ensure that the entire scope of this project, you know, has enough benefits that they outweigh the total cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9570)|
| 2:39:50| So I'll leave that with Councilman Smith, if you want to respond to the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| If you don't, perhaps we can discuss it at a later date and get more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9595)|
| 2:40:00| But I support postponing so we can get more clarity around details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| And also so that we can leave time for the parties to meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| Just like Councilman Thomas beautifully stated, this is often how things come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9613)|
| 2:40:22| We will see an item on the agenda, but the parties have met and need to meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| And that's really what we prefer to see as a council, is that those negotiations are able to happen, a resolution is reached, and then we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9628)|
| 2:40:40| Or we're able to remove the issue sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| But yeah, I agree with Councilman Thomas that that time is needed for those parties to be able to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9643)|
| 2:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| I'll briefly answer your question related to 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| It's based on the $410,000 a year that I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| So the total cost of that, of what's addressable, and it's the debt service and the capital improvement fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9659)|
| 2:41:09| So no, not the infrastructure cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| We don't include that with any project that we consider for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| Speaking to your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| I want to address the two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| I tried to make the case earlier, and maybe I did, it just wasn't favored, but I'll try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9682)|
| 2:41:27| I think a community benefits agreement is just an agreement between a private party and another private party to do this, and I'll hold you accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9687)|
| 2:41:37| Essentially, the developer has made their decision about the community benefit agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9697)|
| 2:41:44| They've contracted with seven organizations to either donate money or hire them for workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9704)|
| 2:41:51| So sometimes we get caught up on, because it's not officially called a community benefits agreement, that it doesn't necessarily serve as a contractual obligation to the party that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9711)|
| 2:42:02| So YWCA, Knoxville Urban League, all of those organizations that I mentioned earlier are basically community agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| They just don't have the banner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| It's not one contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| It's not one list of simple bullets on one piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| In other words, I'm saying the developer has chosen the community benefits agreement based on the organizations that are in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9737)|
| 2:42:24| helping those folks, and committed to for 30 years helping workforce development in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9744)|
| 2:42:31| Maybe the developer won't say it, but essentially they've chosen the organizations to contract with on a community benefits contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9751)|
| 2:42:41| You can't just substitute agreement with a contract and list off the $4 million of seven organizations that are going to help people get jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9761)|
| 2:42:47| You have a community benefits contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| So the reason I say that is because there's another organization that wants to participate in that, that wants to advocate for a specific thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9772)|
| 2:43:03| There may be another one in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| Even if there's not another one in two weeks, both parties have agreed to continue to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| So whether we approve this or not, those parties will continue to meet according to what I heard earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9791)|
| 2:43:19| And there's five more votes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| So there was a comment earlier about no leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| We have five more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| If you want to hold leverage on for those votes, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| Two more weeks is not going to change the fact that there's organizations in East Knoxville who have been contracted to do the work of getting folks jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9809)|
| 2:43:38| And I don't think two more weeks is going to do anything different for those organizations that have been selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| Community benefits agreement is in place with seven organizations, whether it's formally called that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9824)|
| 2:43:51| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| Councilmember Ryder, speaking to the amendment to postpone the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9833)|
| 2:43:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| In regards to the amendment to postpone, may I ask Mr. Boyd or Mr. Kirchhofer a question about how long, to follow along the lines of Mr. Smith's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9840)|
| 2:44:14| How long ago did you start meeting with the organizations that you have agreements with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9854)|
| 2:44:20| I know I met with you for the first time in, I believe, June of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9860)|
| 2:44:26| So when did you start meeting with other organizations that you have agreements with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| As soon as we, Randy Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| Yeah, you don't have to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9874)|
| 2:44:35| Okay, I don't have to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| The initial conversations started when we first started thinking about the project, so at least a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| The community support that we've done with many of the different organizations, from Middlemore Youth to Green Magnet Academy, those have been also over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9884)|
| 2:44:54| I do want to make, if I could, make a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| We are not signing a community benefits agreement with labor unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| That's not what we would do over the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| So I want to make sure that I didn't misspeak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| Everything that Councilman Smith said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| We have so many agreements already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| We've already written checks before even we have an agreement to do something in anticipation, because we're going to do the right thing regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9910)|
| 2:45:19| But the idea and your question to me was, will you meet with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| And absolutely I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| I want to work with anybody that wants to help people in East Knoxville get the skills they need to create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| And that's my commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| But it wasn't to delay for two weeks for me to come up with a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| It's not a negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| It's a partnership to find a way to make a difference in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| And so nothing is going to change in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| Council Member Ryder, any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| Can I clarify what motions are on the floor, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| The motion on the floor is to postpone this item for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| Can I call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| Now we're going to do a roll call vote on calling for the question on the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| On the motion to postpone, because that's the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| So this would conclude debate on postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9961)|
| 2:46:04| Does everyone understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| She's calling for the question on a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Nobody else has their light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| So what we're voting on, I guess there isn't anyone with a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| So do we need to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| She had her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9981)|
| 2:46:22| Let's vote on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| A yes vote is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| A no vote is not to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=9992)|

| 2:46:40| We're voting on postponing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10002)|

| 2:47:08| To approve item 11E, the interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10028)|

| 2:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10668)|
| 2:57:58| So you're saying this LexisNexis system is solely to do background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10678)|
| 2:58:08| No, ma'am, not solely to do background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| We may connect people, look at people from crime information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| A lot of our background checks is mostly what we use for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10696)|
| 2:58:19| but we use it in criminal investigations at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10699)|
| 2:58:22| We can find relatives of people and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| It's all open source information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10705)|
| 2:58:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| I'm very interested in new technology that the police department uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| and I'm really interested to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10719)|
| 2:58:47| and I feel like the public needs to understand any new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| that comes into use by the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10731)|
| 2:58:56| and all planned uses for the technology as well as potential future uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10736)|
| 2:59:04| So I would ask you to come to our Citizens Police Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| that's upcoming in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| because we'll be going through that as part of the Citizens Police Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| I would love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| I've already submitted my interest in attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| I do not want to fill out the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| Chief Miller has told me about the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10760)|
| 2:59:24| and we're adjusting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10764)|
| 2:59:25| Neither of us was familiar with some of those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| so we are adjusting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| Thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| I'm okay with supporting this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| but I do want to see Knoxville adopt a process that gives us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| more information about any new technology that's adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10779)|
| 2:59:46| so that we can review it on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10795)|

| 3:00:27| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| This is a resolution that also concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| Would you mind talking about how this grant would be used by KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| It's actually a grant from the railroad that would be used for overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10842)|
| 3:00:46| for our officers or people who are trespassing on railroad property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10846)|
| 3:00:51| If you look at the past three years, we've had five deaths by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10851)|
| 3:00:56| who have trespassed on railroad property, and as most of us are familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10856)|
| 3:01:00| sometimes a train can take up to a mile to stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| but by the time an engineer sees a person on the tracks, it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10862)|
| 3:01:07| Railroad police, of course, are short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| They don't have quite as many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| and having overtime officers in the area will assist them and us as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10872)|
| 3:01:18| to keep these deaths from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| Do you have a sense of how much of this work might engage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10881)|
| 3:01:28| experiencing homelessness and not still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| I couldn't tell you that until we actually start and get on the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10891)|
| 3:01:34| I know we've worked with the railroad before in clearing out private property areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| We work in tandem with them quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| and I'm sure some of those folks are experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10901)|
| 3:01:44| but that is private property, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| it's really to prevent deaths on those railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10907)|
| 3:01:55| The reason I want to raise concerns with this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| and also there was funding under the allocations we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10917)|
| 3:02:04| through the American Recovery Fund Act dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10924)|
| 3:02:10| I can't remember the exact language of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| but it was remediation efforts for pollution to our creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10932)|
| 3:02:23| One thing that I said, I didn't bring this up during our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| but I said it when meeting with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| is that if we invest our dollars in, for instance, with the creeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| and other things, and more public restrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| and more public facilities that folks can use that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10961)|
| 3:02:49| would limit their need to use our creek beds for those uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10969)|
| 3:02:56| we wouldn't need to respond to situations with our law enforcement resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10976)|
| 3:03:05| or with these remedial resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| because we have given individuals the support that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10988)|
| 3:03:15| to not end up in these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| So I wonder, you know, even with the railroads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| how much are our policies pushing individuals onto those properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=10999)|
| 3:03:25| And if we were designating safe places for people experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11005)|
| 3:03:31| to go, including those with criminal backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| and those who've been banned from the shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| you know, would there be a need to police the railroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| as much as there is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| So my concern is that we jump to the easy solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| rather than investing in the solutions that will actually prevent folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11030)|
| 3:03:54| from seeking shelter and seeking safe places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11034)|
| 3:03:59| in places that aren't necessarily that safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11039)|
| 3:04:02| That's my concern with the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| So these funds through the railroad can be only used for overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11047)|
| 3:04:11| They can't be used for any kind of other items like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| For example, I'm assuming you're thinking porta-potties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| or structures with restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11059)|
| 3:04:20| I wouldn't use this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| Ms. Parker, I think your question is really more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11062)|
| 3:04:25| not really directed to Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| but about our efforts to end and prevent homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11067)|
| 3:04:30| And as you well know, this council has supported many of our proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11070)|
| 3:04:35| if not all of them, to address homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| with more street outreach workers, safe space, shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11078)|
| 3:04:42| you know, transitional housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11082)|
| 3:04:45| You know, we put a million dollars towards non-congregate housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| All of those things that are best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| are things that the city is funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| And this is also, in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| to try to prevent people from getting run over by trains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11098)|
| 3:05:02| I mean, it's not that we do one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| We do both, and this council has been incredibly supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11104)|

| 3:05:12| Just one last thing I want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| One thing that we still have yet to do is acknowledge the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11114)|
| 3:05:18| who are not able to find shelter in the shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11118)|
| 3:05:23| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| whether it's some sort of managed outdoor emergency shelter-type situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11125)|
| 3:05:35| we're going to have to deal with that as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| because we keep saying folks have to go to the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11137)|

| 3:05:56| In fact, I've even heard from folks in the homeless community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11156)|

| 3:06:32| It's really just to keep people off that property, to keep them safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11192)|
| 3:06:36| We don't want to have to criminalize folks for being on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=11196)|

| 3:29:22| Hi, I'm Elizabeth Allman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12562)|
| 3:29:35| I live at 5317 Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| I moved over to Nickel Road in 2019 after you guys approved my rezoning to build our house behind my parents to help my parents since they are elderly and need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12578)|
| 3:29:50| In doing so, I have two small children that are special needs and I take care of them routinely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12590)|
| 3:29:57| So we are driving on and off Nickel Road at least six plus times a day between school and my husband's job that I'm now having to drive him to because I'm out of car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12597)|
| 3:30:12| The therapies that we go to and just so happened I was picking up my son's friend from school that day and driving down Nickel Road and all it took was one person crossing that center line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12612)|
| 3:30:26| I had nowhere to go but a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| So my car goes into the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12630)|
| 3:30:32| My partially deaf three-year-old is screaming with airbag burn on his face because he doesn't understand what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12632)|
| 3:30:41| If the city of Knoxville could have had that ditch filled in when Ms. Brenda had asked for it and brought that to the attention of the city, I wouldn't have had my accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12641)|
| 3:30:57| My autistic seven-year-old is traumatized every time I leave the house because I had to call my dad to go pick him up from school and then he had to drive by my car in a ditch and see me and his brother standing on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12657)|
| 3:31:14| The telephone pole knocked out in front of the car and all the damage and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12674)|
| 3:31:21| So now every time I leave my house and my autistic seven-year-old is not with me, he's terrified that I'm not going to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12681)|
| 3:31:30| So I understand that the accident itself was caused by the person who chose to not pay attention to their driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12690)|
| 3:31:39| But had that road been repaired before that person chose to make their decision, I wouldn't be standing here today begging you to please look at the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12699)|
| 3:31:54| Drive it a couple of times. See where the white lines are completely rubbed off and down in the ditch because they are no longer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12714)|
| 3:32:03| What road used to be there is not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12723)|
| 3:32:08| I understand that what happened to me cannot be changed, but it can be changed for the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12728)|
| 3:32:17| We don't need any more people in a ditch because no one wants to drive this road and look at repairing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12737)|
| 3:32:24| We're all concerned about a stadium building such beautiful pieces to our city, but we're not keeping up with the city we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12744)|
| 3:32:33| So I beg of you, please come look at this road. Do what you can. Put a culvert in and cover the culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12753)|
| 3:32:42| All it would have taken for me to stay on the road would have been to veer just not even a foot off the side of the road and back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12762)|
| 3:32:50| and I would have been perfectly fine to move on the rest of my day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| But instead, I'm sitting here battling an insurance company who looks at me like a number on a chart because this is the time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12774)|
| 3:33:03| Everybody gets an accident, so you're just going to have to wait a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12783)|
| 3:33:07| And sorry, the other person didn't stop, so now you don't have a rental car, so figure it out for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12787)|
| 3:33:12| So all of the repercussions that have happened mentally, emotionally, I have to drive that road every single day and look at where my car was in a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12792)|
| 3:33:23| I had to crawl out of my vehicle and go face down in my back seat and beg my three-year-old who was crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12803)|
| 3:33:33| and didn't understand what I was trying to tell him to crawl himself out of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12813)|
| 3:33:40| That should never have happened had this city been more prepared to keep up with the roads that are currently degraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12820)|
| 3:33:47| And it's not just Nickel Road, but right now, I don't know how else to get that point across to anybody who would be willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12827)|
| 3:33:57| All it takes is one person to look at this road and see how dangerous it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12837)|
| 3:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12844)|

| 3:34:38| But I moved here recently, about four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12878)|
| 3:34:42| I don't know how the voting process was put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12882)|
| 3:34:45| I'm curious who is in charge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12885)|
| 3:34:49| Mr. Delaria, public forum is an opportunity for us to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| We may be able to answer some of your questions at the conclusion of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12892)|
| 3:34:55| Sure. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12895)|
| 3:34:56| So I do want to find out who is in charge of that, who would put that in place, and how that could possibly be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12896)|
| 3:35:02| My point is that I feel as though we shouldn't be electing district council people across the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12902)|
| 3:35:15| For me, what that does, I guess what I can say is that if there is an imbalance of voter turnout from different parts of different districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12915)|
| 3:35:24| what could happen is that one district could pick the representative of a different one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12924)|
| 3:35:32| and therefore you're losing that other district's voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12932)|
| 3:35:35| So that's what I would want to find out, how to get that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12935)|
| 3:35:39| And I think it's important for me to say that in public forum anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12939)|
| 3:35:42| just so that the opinion is out there, and people can decide what they feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12942)|
| 3:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=12947)|
