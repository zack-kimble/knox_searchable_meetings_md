| 0:04:54| Okay. Time now for my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| I know a lot of people in our community, including council members, have been getting ready for back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| whether we have friends and family who work at our schools or we have kids attending schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| It's a busy, busy time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| So students return Thursday morning, and as we know, a smooth start to the school year relies on everyone working in tandem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| to make sure our kids have the best year possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| So just yesterday, KPD joined other first responders and school leaders as they talked about enhanced safety measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| including a new anonymous text-to-tip app that students, faculty, and families can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| And this is also a good time to remind drivers to slow down in school zones and to be extra alert at school crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=335)|
| 0:05:44| And I know KPD will be enforcing the speed zones around schools at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| but maybe especially this time of year when it's back to school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| So I'm very excited to welcome kids back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| As our kids go back to school, families might be more interested in what kind of resources are available in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| So good luck, because we have our annual Neighborhood Resource Fair this Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Jacob Building at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| More than 80 groups will be on site, ready to inform you about their programs and answer questions about their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| This is various nonprofits, several city departments, and community groups like the American Job Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| Goodwill Industries, the Change Center, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| This is a drop-in event designed to help community members plug into all Knoxville has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| Admission is free, and we hope to see you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| There are also, I think, food and drinks and door prizes, and it's fun as well as informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| So you might want to stop by if you have time on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| It's a really cool occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=411)|

| 0:07:09| Robert's Rules of Order state that remarks must be germane to the question ahead of the assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| That is, statements must have a bearing on whether the pending motion should be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| Those who fail to adhere to these rules may be ruled out of order and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| For those who are listening, please note you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=446)|

| 0:10:09| 9A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to amend the Charter of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=609)|

| 0:10:20| entitled An Act to Incorporate the City of Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=620)|

| 0:10:54| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Council, there's one person who signed up to speak on this item in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| Mr. Bentley Marlowe, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Mr. Marlowe, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| You can step up to the podium, turn on the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Bentley Marlowe, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921 in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| More of the same from two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| I oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I don't believe there's been enough public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Somebody who's had the issue of public comment used against me when I've tried to propose changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| even though I had four public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| this having only been brought before us once and an opportunity to have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| I think it's a bit rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| It seems to be following the rushed timeline that Mr. Roberto has laid out for his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| I kind of think that we should probably take a little bit more time, have some workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| more opportunities for input, because there's far more than just this issue that needs to be addressed in our city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| So, that's the gist of my, just in principle, opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| In the particulars here, the implications of this would be that six Council seats would be in the same election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| That is two-thirds of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| So, in the event that we have some overwhelming movement that comes in and changes six seats of Council overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=733)|
| 0:12:22| we literally could have a new majority with a new make-up that could pass new regulations, new rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| that would totally upend the way business is conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| And that is not conducive for business environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| It takes, particularly what I do in construction, trades, building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| I spend years sometimes on projects of planning and working through things and going through the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| And so, if that is changed all of a sudden, after one election cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| that could potentially derail people from even having the incentive to start a long-term project or a long-term business venture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=770)|
| 0:12:59| because there would simply be too much risk for the entire make-up of the regulatory boards and rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=779)|
| 0:13:09| to change, literally overnight, if two-thirds of Council changed all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| So, I think we really need to work and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| I feel for the voters over in the 5th, and I really have a lot of sympathy with Charles' argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| that somebody who ran, that people in the 5th don't have that opportunity to run at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| and then two years later run in the district or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| That is a huge disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| But I don't think the solution to that is moving them to put two-thirds of Council all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| I think we could talk about more creative solutions that probably provide a better mix if we had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| The one idea I've kicked out is if we adjusted it so that our at-large, because it is much costlier to run at-large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| a lot more work, if we made our at-large have six-year terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| then we could make the election cycles look like two districts or regions, if Roberto's proposal advances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=836)|
| 0:14:05| with one at-large in each election cycle, so that there's only ever one-third of Council at stake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| which would better provide continuity to prevent some sort of knee-jerk reaction from the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| to just clean house if they were to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| But ideas such as that could be thoroughly vetted and talked about and kicked around and brainstormed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| if we simply made it a priority to have a workshop session to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| before we just start putting options before voters that are hastily crafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you, Council. That concludes the people who signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| This has not been hastily crafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| This has been talked about for years in my district and months with the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| We're all very well reversed with the situation in the Fifth District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| and the disadvantage that the current system has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Just for the public, what this all boils down to is the voters and the candidates in the Fifth District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| simply want to be treated the same way as the voters and the candidates in all the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| And so I would hope that my colleagues would support this motion on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you. Any further discussion? Council Member Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| I just want to point out that as it stands now, the majority of Council turns over in that election cycle anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| It's either five City Council seats or six if this changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| So a majority of Council turns over with the election cycle anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| And I would only add that this may not always be the case as far as veterans and newbies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| The reason why we kind of get this mass turnover is because incumbents almost always run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| and incumbents almost always get elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| That's not going to be the case over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| At some point, an incumbent is not going to run, like the person to my right did last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| and at some point incumbents are going to get beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| And when that happens, it won't be a completely six-member turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| You'll have veterans that run and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| So that is the long-term solution to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Parker, I couldn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| No problem. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| Since the speaker brought up this issue, I did ask our City Council staff if they could help with some research on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1000)|
| 0:16:53| And Will Johnson did, the recorder, Will Johnson, did offer some moments within our code and charter that require a two-third vote by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1013)|
| 0:17:09| And so I wanted to put this on the record so voters were aware this is going to go to you for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| So it is something that you should be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| If Council has to pass ordinances on two votes, but we can also pass it on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| an emergency vote can be approved by two-thirds of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| An amendment or repeal of Council's rules of order take two-thirds of an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1058)|
| 0:17:47| Suspension of a rule of order requires two-third vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| To expel a member for disorderly conduct takes two-third vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| Filling a vacancy on Council requires six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| Filling a vacancy in the Office of Municipal Judge requires six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1083)|
| 0:18:14| To limit or extend debate on an issue takes six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| To object to the consideration of a question takes six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| To adopt an agenda item that conflicts with existing order of business takes two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| To change the order of the questions presented to Council takes six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1113)|
| 0:18:43| Those are just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| Nothing really stood out to me as giving the six members power that concerns me more than a majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1128)|
| 0:19:00| which currently is held by the five district reps that come in at the same time, often, not always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| So I just wanted to share a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| There's a few more, and I can post these to my website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Since this topic has been brought up, it's good for the public to know what votes Council can take with six people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1154)|
| 0:19:23| what decisions Council can take with six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1167)|

| 0:20:58| Council members, we have several people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| I'll call the people in favor, speaking in favor, and then opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| and then we'll go back to your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Yes, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| I'd like to amend the rules and let everyone speak like we did last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| A motion's been made to suspend the rules and allow all the people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| It has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Council Member Amelia Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| This is about the motion on suspending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I had a request from someone in the public to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| and someone signed up to speak was going to give them their slot to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| but I don't know if it's this question or if it's my item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| Is Rick Roach signed up to speak on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| I believe this is the one that, if I can make a friendly amendment to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| to also include a swap of speakers with Rick Roach and Nzinga Amani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Well, maybe we'll vote on Council Member Roberto's motion first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| and then you can make a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I mean, it seems like he wanted to let all the people signed up to speak speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| which is beyond the three for and three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| And if you want to make a separate motion to do what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| I think that was sort of a distinct thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I can make a separate motion, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| So, Council Members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| we had a discussion on Council Member Roberto's motion about there's one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| two, three, four, five, six people signed up to speak in favor of item 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| and one, two, three, four people signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| And this would allow, I guess, all of those people, if they're present, to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| Any – Council Member Helsley, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| I had a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Is that after they speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| We're just talking about the rules of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Substantive amendments would come after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Any questions or discussion about this Council Member Roberto's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Oh, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| That motion, that rule change carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Council Member Parker, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Make a motion to suspend our rules to allow Nzingha Amani to speak in place of Vic Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1416)|
| 0:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Is there a second to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| The motion, this would be allowing Z – what's their last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| Amani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| Amani to speak in lieu of Vic Roach on Item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1445)|
| 0:24:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Is I saying that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| The motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| I just wanted to state, I'm going to vote no on this only because I don't – this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| is a precedent that I don't want to set for subsequent meetings, regardless if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| calling in late and substituting speakers is not something we should get in the habit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| of, but that's for my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Well, I just would add to that that this is someone who has participated quite often in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| council meetings, but we've changed the – well, the rules have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| We didn't change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| The time you have to sign up to speak by is a rule change that council doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| to make, and so the public is taking time to learn the new rule, and that's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1497)|
| 0:25:04| for the swap, because I believe Zenga called in at like 4.01, 4.05, a few minutes late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| It's a new rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Yeah, I just want to add that the point of treating everyone the same is that the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| apply to everyone unless we amend our rules, and so just for me, I'm not going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| that precedent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| Council Member Parker, are your lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Seeing no further lights on, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Motion does not carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I'll go ahead and start calling on the speakers who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| First is Reverend Sam Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Reverend Brown, president of the Knoxville chapter of the NAACP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| If you could come to the podium, adjust the microphone as you need to, and state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1568)|

| 0:27:57| yielded the most diverse council that we've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| Now, I do understand why some people may have issue with other districts and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| residents in other districts and other parts of the city having a voice in who represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| them, but anything that comes out of our state legislature right now, it truly does give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1692)|
| 0:28:20| me pause, and I question the motives of those who propose this legislation that put us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| this predicament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Now, once again, I'm not even here to discuss the principles or the fundamentals of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| you agree or disagree with this charter amendment, but I do believe that it is the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1714)|

| 0:28:48| to make that choice and not have to live under something that is imposed on us by our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1728)|

| 0:28:59| Why is our state legislature trying to limit our choices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Why is our state legislature trying to make more shallow the pool of voters selecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| those who will enact local policy that governs our day-to-day lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| We have an opportunity right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Our state legislature has already imposed on us partisan school board elections, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| we have already seen how chaotic that has become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| We see what divisiveness, how it obstructs government in our school board and in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| It gives me some consolation to know that the city council person from District 1 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| District 2 and District 3 must at some point come to District 6 and talk to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| that I lead and serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Please, city council, put this to the voters in Knoxville so that we will have a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| to choose on how we want to be governed locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| Thank you so much, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this item is Larry Deering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| Larry Deering, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Mr. Deering, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1819)|
| 0:30:29| My name is Larry Deering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| I live at 200 Adair Drive in Knoxville, and I'm speaking on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| But before I get started, I want to say something to this council that you need to hear, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| unfortunately, I'm sure don't hear often enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Thank you for the hard work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I want to begin by reciting a few lines from a song by Chuck Brodsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| The boys in the back room played golf every Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| There was a pinnacle game that took place on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| Tuesday were the meetings to which the public was invited, but no wrongs were ever righted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| Couldn't happen here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Well, not with the quality of council members that we've been electing for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| But I think we all know that not every elected official is ethical and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| And what could easily happen with five members of city council answering only to their own district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| Somebody could sneak in, work with the boys in the back room, and get something absolutely horrible passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| And those who voted for that thing would not be answerable to everybody in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1904)|
| 0:31:52| So something that could be harmful to my district could be passed with votes of the other four district council members and one at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1912)|
| 0:32:02| Is this likely to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Not in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| With future council members, it could be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| So the whole point is, why offer temptation to people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| The way we've been doing it since 1969 works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| So I do urge you to vote in favor of 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| Thank you. The next person signed up to speak in favor of 9B is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| Miss Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| You can state your name and address for the record. You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you. My name is Joyce Feld, and I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| I'm here tonight to ask you to vote yes on item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| As an active member of this community, and one who votes in every election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| I've always loved that members of city council have been elected through a citywide vote in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| The majority of the decisions that council makes affects every resident of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| no matter which district they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And I appreciate that all Knoxville voters have had a voice in who each member will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| The system has made all members of council accountable to everyone in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| and the process has guaranteed a public that is more engaged in the city's civic life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| This system, as somebody else mentioned, has also produced the most diverse council that we've ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| Over the years, I've reached out frequently to council members about issues that I've been concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| and every member has always been responsive and willing to dialogue with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| whether they agreed with my position or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| This is not the case with every legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| We need to ensure that this continues for everyone in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So, once again, I'm asking you to please vote for this resolution to be on our ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Next person signed up to speak in favor of 9B is Kaylee McVetie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| Ms. McVetie, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| Hi there. My name is Kaylee McVetie. I live in 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| I'm here today to speak in support of Roberto's Charter Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| I've been following this change for months and watched all three hours of the discussion two weeks ago at the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| I'm nervous that the majority of Knoxvillians do not quite understand the gravity that this change has on our town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| and our ability to maintain accountability and accessibility to all of our council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| I've lived in many cities throughout the country before landing here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| One thing I know is that Knoxville is very special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| and I know I've vocalized that to many of you here on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| This town is precious because we still operate on the grounds of being a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Knoxvillians are invested in their friends, neighbors, neighborhoods, schools, and strategic growth of our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| Knoxvillians take pride in statements like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| we aren't like those other big cities, and we don't want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| I've lived in other big cities, and I can tell you that when I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I never once had accessibility to any representatives making decisions for the growth of my town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| When I moved here, I was amazed that places like this still exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| and since then, I've become invested in making sure that Knoxville maintains this sweet community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| that is disappearing from what seems like every other town in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| And that's why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| My current District 18 State House Representative, Elaine Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| who, in case nobody knows, does not even live in the city limits of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| made a decision and passed a bill last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| taking away Knoxvillians' accessibility to all City Council members as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| The bill decreases our representation from all nine members to just four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| your District Representative in the three at-large spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| I know it's common sense, but I have to just say it out loud, that that's not even half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| How are the voters going to have any stake in how our town grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| if we don't even have accountability from half of our voting members on Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| This is a move that will definitely change our town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| and this is a move that will turn us, slowly, into every other town in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| I watched last reading as one of our City Council members raised concern about this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| disparaging our majority-minority districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| a concern that I find very valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| as representation is absolutely needed for all of our populations in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| However, I was unable to find any evidence of disenfranchisement in any of those arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| District 6 was brought up as one of our majority-minority populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Gwen McKenzie, an African-American female, won the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| and then went on to win more citywide votes than any other member of this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Amelia, you were elected in a citywide at-large race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| And finally, Seema, another minority on our Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| was runner-up in her district-only race and then won on a citywide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Further, six out of nine of our Council members are female, and so is our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| I think the voices of Knoxville and the actions of the Knoxvillean voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| speak loud and clear that we vote on competency and not on prejudices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| The paper that was cited last City Council meeting just doesn't represent our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| And for that reason, please let us, the people of Knoxville, vote on this in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2265)|
| 0:37:53| At the last City Council meeting, there was a comment made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| that Knoxvilleans shouldn't be able to vote on this, and I could not disagree more with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| When you decrease somebody's representation and the magnitude that this does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| we absolutely should have a say in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| And so I just want to reiterate to anybody here that this vote today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| is just as to whether or not Knoxvilleans get to make this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| as opposed to our state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| and I absolutely think that this vote should be in the hands of Knoxvilleans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| The next person signed up to speak in favor of 9B is Cliff Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Mr. Rogers, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Clifford Rogers, 3526 Kingston Pike, 37919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| former Administrator of Elections for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Before I touch upon any of the concerns or issues with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| let us not lose focus of where we are and what you are being asked to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| With all due respect, in my view, your role here tonight is simply one of a gatekeeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| like mine was at the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| We decided who could legally vote and who could not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| who could run for office and who could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| We did not decide the underlying issues are racist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| The voters did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| That's all that's being asked of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Are these proposed amendments, or this one in particular, ballot-worthy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| In other words, should the voters have the opportunity to approve of these amendments or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| Or are you going to just shut the door in their faces and tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| no, we can't actually trust you to decide on matters touching the underpinnings of our democracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| specifically how we conduct our city elections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| I might remind you that you trusted these very same voters when you ran for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| to do the right thing and elect you, and they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| So why would you not now trust them to exercise their collective wisdom on these amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| Let all of the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| And let me remind you, too, lest you forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| that you can still vote to allow all of our residents to decide these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| and you could vote against them in November, as any other resident could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| should they believe now or become convinced later that these are not in the best interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| That is not inconsistent with your role of gatekeeper tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| In fact, that's precisely what democracy is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| And speaking of democracy, isn't that what these amendments do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| They provide a mechanism, like we've apparently had since 1969,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| for all city voters to weigh in on all nine races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| As things now stand, without these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| pursuant to the mandate of the super meddling super majority party over in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| my former party of let local folks decide local issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| for the first time ever, you and I will no longer vote in all nine races, but only four, not even a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2480)|
| 0:41:29| What a remarkable and uncalled for change in our elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| Doesn't sound like more democracy to me, which is what they were telling us down there in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| Now, with respect to the issues surrounding these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| I'm well aware that the Knoxville New Sentinel published an article today discussing, by my count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| one argument for and five against these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Knoxville New Sentinel consulted and quoted, obviously, very erudite professors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| one from UNC at Charlotte, one from Ohio State, one from Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Vanderbilt got two, we got zero, down here where I went to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| And these professors were not like ones maybe here in Knoxville could have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| who would not have been restricted to their theoretical bubble in a neighboring state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| They would have seen you all and see how we operate here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| But these arguments that were put forth by the New Sentinel, they do need to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| But let's talk about them between now and November to see whether or not they have any merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| The overriding concern seems to be the potential for no minority representation on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2562)|
| 0:42:52| But as has been pointed out, look around. You all are Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| This is about as diverse as it gets. It accurately reflects, I think, the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| and the city of Knoxville has done themselves proud by electing a diverse group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| This concern that has been put forth, it may be valid in some cities, but it's not here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2591)|
| 0:43:22| I'm not going to go through the rest of these. I'm running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| But let's just put them on the ballot, folks. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you. The last person signed up to speak in favor of Item 9B is one of a former council member herself, Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2613)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you for being here. If you'll step up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| And as you know, we ask that you state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| It's always a pleasure to be here. I urge you to vote in favor of 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| I served on council from 1991 to 2001. It was a different era, a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| There were two women on council, one member of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| I think Knoxville has advanced greatly since those days, and I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| I urge you to vote for this 9B because it allows the voters of Knoxville to continue to vote for all nine council seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2674)|
| 0:44:45| so that all members of council are accountable to everyone in every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| This charter amendment enables and protects independent voices on city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| and protects the free and candid exchange of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| And again, that's important and good for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| Why do I say that? I was one with something of an independent voice on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| So how does nine council members facing all the voters help protect independent voices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2714)|
| 0:45:27| District council members are able to advocate their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| even if it's contrary to the wishes of the other members of council or even the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| because they know that every district is protected by the virtue of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| that every member has to face the voters of every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| Five members of council can't get together and squeeze a district or squeeze a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Why? Because you're going to face them. You're going to face those voters the next time you run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| The importance of having independent voices cannot be overstressed, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| What brings about progress in any city and in any county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| I appreciate the work and the thought that has gone into these charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| The Knoxville election process should be decided by the voters, as has been said by other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| There is no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| The people of the city of Knoxville deserve to vote on the election process they would like to have and live under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| No election process is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| I think it's unfortunate to say the very least that the state legislature has taken the action it has taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2796)|
| 0:46:46| What you're doing by putting this on the ballot, or if you vote to put it on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| what you're doing is allowing the people of the city of Knoxville to again look at a voting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| that they have enjoyed in the past, with some changes, of course, due to the legislative act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| but at least gives the people of the city of Knoxville the idea that, as their elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2825)|
| 0:47:15| you trust them and you care about what they have to say on this very important, very important topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| Again, I appreciate all the work you've done. I ask you to pass this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you. Council now will move to people who have signed up to speak in opposition to Item 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| starting with Bentley Marlow. Mr. Marlow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2851)|
| 0:47:41| Hi there. Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| My opposition to this is much the same as it was last week, or two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| We only vote for one state house representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| Several represent Knoxville, but you only get to vote for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| We only get to vote for one U.S. Congressman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| I think there's nine that represent, or eleven that represent the entire state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| but we only get to vote for one, and nobody seems to feel like they're not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| Nobody's screaming in outrage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| There's 435 members of Congress. You only get to vote for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| but nobody thinks that they're not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| No. You form a relationship with a representative that lives in your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| that experiences life pretty much the same as you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| in the 30 square blocks that we heard someone talk about last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| Every neighborhood is unique and different, and they have different concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| That's why it's important to maintain a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| and have a district representative that's answerable to the people in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| It's the preference of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Under this proposal, people could come in third in their region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| yet win the thing outright if they get enough votes from certain parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| It's entirely mathematically possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Probably impossible in the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| because that's where the highest voter turnout is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| But if you were in a low voter turnout district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| such as the third, or the fifth, or mine, the sixth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| you could come in third in your region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| but win the day with 50 plus one over in district two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| It's mathematically possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I think this needs a lot more thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| We need to think about unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| The precedent is all over the place that you vote for one representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| statehouse, one representative in the U.S. Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| This idea that somehow we're going to lose representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| by not voting for all nine, I think, is quite ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| We never should have voted for all nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| The reason that we voted for all nine was so that areas that are more affluent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| and have higher voter turnout can have sort of a veto power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| to keep other districts in check, and that's exactly what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| We see that in things playing out before us all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| Duplexes. I said this two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| You try to put a duplex in district two, in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| you're going to fill up this auditorium with people against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| You want to put a duplex in my neighborhood, in district six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| not a single person's going to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| You want to put it in maybe district three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| I seriously doubt anybody's going to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| District four, they might say something, depending on which neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| But it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| If it's in district two, you're going to fill this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| and it becomes a very torturous ordeal that everybody has to sit through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| because you all have to weigh the pros and cons of listening to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| in district two who comes out and votes in such a large turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| that it's difficult to say no to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| And so if we make this that way for all the elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| we could never possibly get to where the interests of each individual district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| are truly given the attention that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| because you guys will be beholden to where the vote's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| And right now, and has been for at least two decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| the majority of the votes come from West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| And so I think that, like I said two weeks ago, in principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| I wouldn't have a problem if we saw voter turnout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| in approximately the same amounts across the whole city, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| And so I think that while we look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| we need to be crafting a solution that takes in the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| of how our voter turnout is and who's going to have the most say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| and the most access to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Because I dare say that someone that is higher educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| and has higher income and more means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| they can participate even if they don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| I regularly donate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| I donated to Mr. Park in South Knoxville in this county race election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| I couldn't vote for him, but I could support him with my wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And I don't think anyone in the second district has any disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| to use their wallet to support any of the other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| other than the four they can vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| It's how it's done everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| I only vote for one county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| I only vote for one House member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| but I've given money to other House candidates outside of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| Same with U.S. Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| So I think that that's just the fairest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| And again, I still think that we need more discussion just to flesh this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Mr. Roberto himself said that this was rushed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| and I think that should be enough to give us all pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Next person signing up to speak against 9B is Nick Ciparro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| Ciparro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Ciparro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Ciparro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Everyone messes that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| If you could start by stating your name and the correct pronunciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| so we'll learn, and then your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| It's Nick Ciparro, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| I have a feeling that I might be a little bit responsible for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| because it was my race in 2001 against Ms. Singh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| where I won the district, District 3, by north of 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| So that happened, but I did lose by about 140, 150 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| I believe somewhere in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| And it was South Knoxville that had a 10 to 1 ratio against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| Mr. Smith did pretty good campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| It happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| And, you know, you win some, you lose some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| But what happened after that, and so I'm going to have to educate the crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| and everybody about what happened because it seems like a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| There were about six to eight neighborhood associations in our district that met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| They had a giant meeting, and District 3, when they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| oh, Elaine Davis is not part of District 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| no, she doesn't live in District 3, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| But her state representative district covers most of District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| So they went to her and they asked, why is this like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| Why are we voting like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Because, honest to goodness, when I knocked on north of two 3,000 doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| not a single voter understood this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| They did not understand that the district is one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| and then it's at large during the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Now, I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| It happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| We even talked about it, you know, amicably and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| But most of the voters did not, and they were aggravated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| District 3, I mean, I hate to say this, but I don't think a single one of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| politically represent District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| Diversity, I mean, you all are Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| This is a fact, unless I think Lynn might not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| So diversity by political, it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| And meanwhile, my district is a very, very overwhelmingly Republican district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| So that being said, they asked her, a Republican, can you fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Because every other city does not have the old rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| No other city in Tennessee except for very, very small locations had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| And the rules are the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| They happen to be what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| I'm not going to dispute that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| But what it is true is that these people were upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| It upset them that their wishes were not honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| You know, it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| So they asked for their wishes to be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| The state stepped in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| That's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| They petitioned, just like you should, your state representative and multiple state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| and then had the law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| They stripped the city of that because they were tired of not being represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| Now, that being said, why I say no to this is because I'm going to be really, really nice about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| and say, if you move forward with something like this, it opens the door for the county to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3362)|
| 0:56:10| Would you like every single school board member at large in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Would you like every county commissioner at large?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| You will lose for another 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| There will not be another Democrat on county commission or any county seat for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| I can guarantee that because it is a 65% majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| That's why you don't want to open this Pandora's box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3401)|

| 0:56:58| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3418)|

| 0:57:03| The next person signed up to speak in opposition to 9B is Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| Mr. Bartholomew, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| This entire process has been rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| The fact that the third amendment tonight would need to be passed via emergency is proof that we're rushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| One postponement, and we're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| More discussion and community involvement is had on a duplex use-on-review than these charter amendments have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| There's no dispute that at-large voting dilutes the votes of a particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| The will of the individuals in that district are overruled by the will of the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| The new state law ensures the district will be permitted and encouraged to send their choice of representative to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| A typical district turns out a couple thousand votes, but across the city it takes 11,000 to 15,000 to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| The proposed charter amendment would dilute the votes of each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| These have been described as a second-generation barriers to minority voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| At-large voting was made illegal at the federal level, and then through the Voting Rights Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| multiple at-large systems have been found to be unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| This occurred in Dillard v. Baldwin City, Dillard v. Crenshaw City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| The DOJ brought action in United States v. West Monroe, Louisiana, United States v. Chamberlain School District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| United States v. East Point, United States v. Town of Lake Park, Florida, United States v. Euclid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| United States v. Georgetown County School District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| And each of these at-large voting was found to be discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| But don't take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| From Shelby v. Holder, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| It soon became apparent that guaranteeing equal access to the polls would not suffice to root out racially discriminatory voting practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3533)|
| 0:59:02| such as voting dilution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes, in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| are aptly described as second-generation barriers to minority voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Second-generation barriers come in various forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| One of the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing of legislative districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| and an effort to segregate the races for the purpose of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| Another adoption is a system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district voting in a city with a sizable black minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| This was Ruth Bader Ginsburg in dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Those were her words, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Clearly stating that at-large voting is, and let me say this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| a second-generation barrier to minority voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| How appropriate that she in the dissent makes this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| She, in the dissent of Shelby v. Holder, made this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| I want you all to think about how you all would feel, and it was hinted on by the previous speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| Many of you all's positions would change if we were to put this at the county commission or the school board ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| Many of your positions would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Okay, the last person standing up to speak in opposition item 9B is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| You can state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I voted local elections, all elections, pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| I think I missed maybe a year's worth in terms of cycles for all levels of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3651)|
| 1:01:02| Since 1972, I was raised to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| When you register to vote, you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| And I've also known about our local seats, city council seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| General election, you can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| But I've never voted outside the district that I resided in, just as a matter of principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3684)|
| 1:01:33| because I don't want people that don't live in my community that I live in, that maybe has a particular set of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3693)|
| 1:01:43| I don't want them, people, as the gentleman illustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| I don't want those people making decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| I don't, about where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| But as it had been practiced, and you all are the best illustration of that, that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3715)|
| 1:02:06| And so, as I have lived the best portion of my life here in Knoxville, in predominantly black communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3726)|
| 1:02:20| the weakest link, as I've iterated, Lauren, you heard me say it multiple times when I was on neighborhood advisory council with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3740)|
| 1:02:29| others, you've heard me say it, this city is only as strong as its weakest link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| And this past round of local elections is a very good illustration of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3756)|
| 1:02:44| I heard the current election commissioner mention that when he was speaking to you at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3764)|
| 1:02:51| he said, one way to get around this is for people to vote, to get people out to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| And historically, 6th District, I don't know, but I know 6th District has a very low voter turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3777)|
| 1:03:10| Very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Considering the so-called registered voters, and I say so-called because why register to vote if you're not going to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3793)|
| 1:03:22| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| And that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| And so we see the results of that because of the fact that other people are making decisions about a particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3806)|
| 1:03:39| We had no say-so about the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| We just didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| We had no say-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Any recommendations for a community benefits agreement to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| No one heard us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| No one wanted to hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Therefore, there was no community benefits agreement, and someone from outside the community that was in vast need of a bump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| I still remember you, Councilman Smith, coming to me and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| what do you think about a $500 million investment in East Knoxville and what that might mean, a boost in the economy and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| Because there was a recognition that so many decisions had been made by so many people outside the 6th District that there was nothing to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3858)|
| 1:04:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| There's a recognition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| You all recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| And so in that process, the model that Councilman Roberto is putting forward, it's just not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3875)|
| 1:04:45| It hasn't worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| It hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| And, you know, we've had promises and all these initiatives made, millions of dollars supposed to be invested and all this other kind of crap, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3890)|
| 1:05:00| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| We're still scrambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Because now I've had too many people from the 6th District that live in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| I don't live in the 6th District anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| I live right next to it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| I'm now in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| And Knoxville, yes, it is becoming more diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| That's the other problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| It is a problem now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Because black folk are spread out through 4th District, 6th District, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| We're all over, but we're still concentrated in McCannsville, Lonsdale, and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| So you've got all that going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| So this is a bad model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| You need to do more study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| That's basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| When I think about the principles of democracy, I see democracy as expansive and not restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3954)|
| 1:06:04| And so I think we should keep that in mind with what we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| We had a change in the state law, and the way that you have, Knoxville, you have voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| for your city council members has already changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| You've gone from getting to vote for all nine members, and now you get to vote for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| Without council doing anything, that's what's already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| Without you voting on it, that's what's already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| You went from nine votes to four votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| The sole purpose of this charter amendment is to preserve the right of every Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| voter to vote on all nine members of their city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| The alternative, which is to do nothing, would be district-only approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| And that will mean that every voter in Knoxville will no longer have a vote for all nine members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| Instead, every voter will only get to vote for their specific district representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| and three at-large members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| That means that a district-only approach will literally divorce every voter from five members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| That's a majority of council will no longer be accountable to the voters of every district in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4033)|
| 1:07:21| The district-only approach means that as few as 500 voters could determine who serves on a city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| that we all know and we see every day when we come in here, makes decisions for the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| Dividing up council into district-only brings out the potential for gerrymandering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4055)|
| 1:07:41| And I don't want to see politicians picking who their voters are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| I want to see voters picking who their politicians are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| Ultimately, I want this to be a choice for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| And there will be some people who want district-only, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| There are reasonable arguments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| But the point is that the citizens of Knoxville, the voters of Knoxville, should be the ones making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| I'm not going to sit up here and do nothing, and in by doing nothing, disenfranchise every voter in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4087)|
| 1:08:17| Nor am I going to cast a vote to adopt a policy that will disenfranchise every voter in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| We need to get, because of what happened with the state law, we have to make a change to our system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4105)|
| 1:08:34| and that change, to bring us into compliance with the state law, needs to be the decision of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| And that's why this is brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| There were some additional comments by our MTAS folks about some non-substantive changes that they wanted to make to this charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4127)|
| 1:09:09| You'll see those in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| Mr. Frost, I know you're passing those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| When you get back to your mic, if you could just maybe talk to us a little bit about whether these are substantive or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4158)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| MTAS and I drafted some proposed revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| We do not think that they are substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Very briefly, we suggest deleting Section 4 simply because that's not needed for the actual question that would appear on the ballot, assuming this passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4186)|
| 1:09:58| And in the new Section 5, we've just merely added nomenclature to make it easier for people to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4198)|
| 1:10:08| For example, District 1 would become South, District 2 would become West, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| So it's a matter of clarification, and we do not think they are substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| I'm going to make a motion to amend consistent with the recommendations of MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| Councilmember Roberto made a motion to amend his original Item 9B per the MTAS recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| You have the amendments before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Mr. Frost explained what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Are there any further questions or discussion on these proposed amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| Councilmember Helsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| Not on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Councilmember Parker, did you have questions on this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| So my question for Mr. Frost is, is this an amendment that would need to be made in the future for Section 404,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| or would it continue to maintain the district language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| Well, what MTAS and I came up with was this 404 would be staying as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| So it wouldn't conflict, though, if Mr. Thomas' proposal passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| because there's a discussion regarding the terms there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| But the district language would remain in the Charter, unless another amendment was brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| Well, Mr. Roberto's proposal has the language that would become in Section 707.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| Right, but the language in Section 404 would remain the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| and so that would remain the district language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Yes, I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Okay, any further questions on the proposed amendments before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Motion to amend carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Councilmember Hesley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Yes, ma'am, I'd like to offer a friendly amendment to 9B, B, and C both to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4344)|
| 1:12:32| This is actually to address the tiebreaker, to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| however, if more than one candidate receives the highest number of votes in the primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| then only those candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be placed on the regular election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| Okay, so you're making a motion to amend Item 9B to add that tiebreaker language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Can I do them together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| No, because one at a time, we're only considering one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Did you have that in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Is that being distributed to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| Is there a second to this motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Motion to amend has been made and seconded to add language to 9B that would incorporate a change to tiebreaker resolution in the event of a tiebreak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4392)|
| 1:13:26| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| I have worked closely with Mr. Frost and MTAS on language to address the tiebreaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| and those are the documents that have been sitting at your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| And there's actually, to fully address it, it needs an additional sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4427)|
| 1:13:58| The sentence that you've proposed is one that we were discussing, but then this afternoon we added another sentence for further clarification because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4438)|
| 1:14:15| it was not addressing the scenario of a tie between second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4455)|
| 1:14:42| And the reason why you have two copies is one gives you a clean copy, one gives you track changes in case you have time during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| Well, Councilmember Parker, we do have a pending motion on the floor to amend item 9B per Ms. Helsley's language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4490)|
| 1:15:01| So you're commenting on that pending motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Yes, I'm commenting on that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| I'm just sharing the update that in a conversation this afternoon, the language to deal with the tiebreaker has been expanded beyond this sentence that's being offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4507)|
| 1:15:20| Okay, do you have Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| First, let's talk about Councilmember Helsley's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| So she is proposing a tiebreaker in two different parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| And that would address her scenario that she presented last week that maybe Vice Mayor Smith talked about too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4536)|
| 1:15:45| For example, two people tying with 100 votes and one person receiving 50 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| Councilmember Helsley's proposal would only have the two people receiving 100 votes going on to the general or regular election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4552)|
| 1:16:04| So what Councilmember Helsley is proposing would go to Councilmember Roberto's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| Councilmember Roberto's initial proposal did not have any tiebreaker language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| Therefore, if Councilmember Helsley's amendment is passed, that would be a substantive change to Councilmember Roberto's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4577)|
| 1:16:28| And that would mean Councilmember Roberto's proposal would be considered on first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| Now, Councilmember Parker, she has a tiebreak proposal that applies to people who may tie in first place as well as people who may tie in second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4596)|
| 1:16:50| So that is the difference between what Councilmember Helsley and Councilmember Parker are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| So they're different, but they're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| They just happen to be on different parts of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| So that's why I assume Councilmember Parker is mentioning her proposal now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4625)|
| 1:17:24| I forgot to mention, for Councilmember Parker, Mr. Johnson and I passed around separate documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| One of us passed around the redlined version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| That's with the additions and things are struck through, additions are underlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| And the other one of us, and I don't remember who it was, passed around the clean version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| That's with no redlines, it's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| Sorry, I forgot to mention that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Okay, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| So my colleague, Councilmember Helsley, you asked for a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| And looking at it, you're making changes to subsection B, which looks like you're adding tiebreaker language in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4683)|
| 1:18:12| And then also in subsection C, where you're making the same change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| My assumption is that your intent here is to add the tiebreaker language to what we've been voting on with the hybrid at large system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4698)|
| 1:18:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4709)|
| 1:18:30| And just like Mr. Frost said, it looks like from what I'm reading between these two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| this scenario is making sure that the candidates receiving the highest number of votes in a tie would advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4717)|
| 1:18:46| It's not having the scenario where, you know, the second and third person might move forward instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| I just wanted to make sure I was clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| So the other thing I want to make sure everyone understands is that Mr. Johnson, maybe you can help me with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4735)|
| 1:19:08| In the recorded history that we have of city council elections, how often have we seen a tie vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4748)|
| 1:19:17| Based on my recollection, the tie vote in 2017 was the first in living memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| So the way I view this is it's a solution looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| It's not likely to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| It's happened once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I'm also okay with it because that's something we've talked about and it's something that we've had some discussions about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| making sure that this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I don't think anyone relishes the opportunity for having to make a vote on council about who wins and loses in a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4782)|
| 1:19:50| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| I'm willing to accept it as a friendly amendment and go ahead and add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| The thing I want to make sure is clear to everybody that if we do that, then we're going back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| And if that happens, then I'm going to make a motion to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| So what I would like is that if you feel inclined to add the tie break, which, again, I'll accept as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4806)|
| 1:20:15| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| I also want to make sure that we pass it on emergency tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| And so I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| If you feel like, hey, I want to add this and I don't want to pass it on emergency, if you could let us know that beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| I think that would be great so that we can make sure that we can move this thing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| But that's what I would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| So, Mayor, I will accept it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Vice Mayor Smith and then Council Member Ryder and then we'll go back to Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| So just to bring myself and the public up to speed, maybe everybody else is up to speed, but this will help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| So this builds upon the intent of Council Member Parker's item from her ordinance last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4857)|
| 1:21:07| and clarifies what happens when the first and second place tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4867)|
| 1:21:16| I think that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| The second part of this is the item that you added more clarity, Council Member Parker, to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| So can you explain what you've added to this substance, which is an extension of your original idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4886)|
| 1:21:37| Yeah, on yours, what have you added in addition to what Council Member Helsley has read out loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Yeah, so the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| Just to clarify, you mentioned a second sentence, so if you could just talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| Well, just to clarify really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| My language originally proposed changed the language of the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4916)|
| 1:22:05| to the candidates receiving the two highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| That's what brought in potential confusion with what are the two highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| If two people get 100 and one person gets 50, do we count 100 as one total and 50 as another total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| To reconcile the two proposals, mine and Roberto's, I no longer change that language in my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4943)|
| 1:22:36| The original language, the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes, remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4956)|
| 1:22:44| And so the only thing that this language proposed by Council Member Helsley does is it allows more than two candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4964)|
| 1:22:59| if three people receive the same vote total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| They can move on to the ballot rather than just two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| If there's a tie involving second place, which is what my experience was, it does not address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| My intention was that we would eliminate the possibility of a tie happening in a city primary in any city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=4996)|
| 1:23:28| We would have already resolved how that is handled in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| Okay, moving on to Council Member Ryder and then Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5014)|
| 1:23:41| If you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Okay, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| I have some questions about the proposed language about the tie break or the highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5030)|
| 1:23:59| Mr. Swanson, in 2017, you're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| Sorry, I can't see because I sit back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| Anyway, I'm going to mark my complaints down again about the seating arrangement, week number whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| Sorry, I'm going to get snarkier and snarkier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| It's just a year left and you have to listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| If you read this language here, I'm asking you for a quick analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| Okay, if first and second place tie in an election, let's go back to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5067)|
| 1:24:36| If first and second place had tied, City Council wouldn't have had to do anything and there would have been no tie break discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| because you would have had first and second tied up with the same number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| But instead, what happens is you have a tie with second and third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| So I'm trying to understand how the language here breaks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| However, if more than one candidate receives the highest number of votes in the primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| in 2017, only one person got the highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| So I'm trying to understand how the language deals with sending two or three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| I feel like there's a word missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| So I realize Mr. Frost, you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| So Ms. O'Hara and I wrestled with this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| I mean we wrestled with language in all the different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| But we purposefully wrote around the word tie, T-I-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Because there is a state statute that talks about ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| And when it comes to a general election, if there's a tie, then it can get thrown to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| So that's why we've got legalese, for good or for bad, and apparently it's for bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| But we tried to write around the word tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| Okay, I don't want the word tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| I don't feel like that's a missing word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| I'm trying to understand how the words in yellow send three people to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| It would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| The amendment that Councilmember Helsley wanted me to compose addressed her scenario of two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5177)|
| 1:26:27| where you had two people that received 100 votes and you had one person receive 50 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5187)|
| 1:26:36| Councilmember Helsley's proposal is that only the two people who received 100 votes would go on to the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5196)|
| 1:26:46| The person who received 50 votes would not go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Well, what if the first place got 100 votes and second and third, which becomes second and second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5213)|
| 1:27:02| if you do competitive sports with cycling, gymnastics, et cetera, and people tie up on points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| That's my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| When you see the results, it says first place, second place, second place, which is the scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| So what happens when the first place candidate has 100 and the second place and the second place have 50 and 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5236)|
| 1:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| That's not addressed by Councilmember Helsley's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| That is addressed by Councilmember Parker's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| because Councilmember Parker's proposal discusses the potential for two or more second place people to have the same number of votes than they would go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5255)|
| 1:27:49| So in using, and Councilmember Parker, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| if you have one person with 100 votes and two people with 50 votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| if Councilmember Parker's proposal passes, the person with 100 votes goes to the general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5278)|
| 1:28:04| and the two people with 50 votes also go on to the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| So I have 37 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| Councilwoman Parker, is that what you understand your language to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| So what would happen if Councilmember Helsley's was passed, as is it only addresses a tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| excuse me, don't use the tie language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| that only addresses a situation where two people have the same number of votes and they're the highest number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| it would cause a similar situation that happened in 2017 or 2019, I don't remember which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Let's move on to anyone else wishing to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| Okay, then I guess we're ready to vote on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Is it all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Wait, wait, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Wait, wait, does someone want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| I might have misheard Councilmember Helsley, but did you only make your motion to apply to the first page of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5348)|
| 1:29:16| Did you mean both the second page as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| I actually said B and C, but you said it'd have to be read again for C, but I did say B and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| I just don't see how we can amend item 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| Oh, section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Once we're at large and once we're at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| I misunderstood, so just let the record reflect that the way you said it is the way you meant it and ignore my misinterpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5372)|
| 1:29:41| If you're not a merchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| Will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Sorry, I misinterpreted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| So you said, I don't think there's any correction needed beyond what we just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| So, your language as you originally said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Does everyone understand the motion on the floor the friendly amendment that Miss Helsley is offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| So, at this juncture, it appears to me that we need one amendment that's going to address both scenarios, rather than voting on one that would only address one scenario, and then we have to start this process back over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5402)|
| 1:30:15| With addressing the tie part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Well, the same number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| If there's one person that has 100 votes and two people that have 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| So, in my opinion, I could be wrong because there's a lot of conversations going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| We really need to have one amendment address one amendment that addresses both scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| Well, Mr. Swanson, feel free if you disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| So, if Councilmember Helsley's proposal passes and Councilmember Parker's proposal passes, and they both appear on the ballot, and they both pass by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5442)|
| 1:30:56| I don't think they would be in conflict, because they would both have tie break language for the first place finisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5456)|
| 1:31:08| But I think Councilmember Parker's tie break language for the second place, it is not contradictory to Mr. Roberto's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5468)|
| 1:31:19| And they could be one could set the Councilmember Parker's could supplement Councilmember Roberto's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| It seems to me that the easiest way to deal with the question that was asked is to simply add the additional sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5488)|
| 1:31:47| If Councilmember Helsley permits it, add the additional sentence that deals not only with the two highest votes, but also deals with when you got the one highest and then two lower votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5507)|
| 1:31:59| And I think that's what the additional sentence in Councilmember Parker's proposal does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5519)|
| 1:32:08| So, if you add that sentence to Councilmember Helsley's amendment, then you got it all covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Would a 10-minute recess allow the attorneys to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| I don't even need a 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| I think he just did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| I mean, Councilmember Parker's, I mean, she would need to, I guess first Councilmember Helsley has to be voted on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5553)|
| 1:32:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| We can just go ahead and add that additional language to Councilmember Helsley's amendment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5563)|
| 1:32:51| And then that will cover it in Councilmember Roberto's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| And then you'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| Ms. Hughes, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| It's off now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Did you all hear my sigh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| So, from a Robert's Rules of Order thing, and I am certainly no parliamentarian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5597)|
| 1:33:28| if we have an amendment on the floor, how do we amend an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Well, we can just, if she desires to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| This is Councilmember Helsley's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| If she wants to modify her amendment to include that additional language, then there's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5622)|
| 1:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Councilmember Helsley, would you like to modify your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| I would, if I can find what I'm supposed to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Where's the newspaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| I've got a few packets over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| Mayor, just for clarification, if we look at the amendment that Councilmember Helsley brought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| she has highlighted items in Section 6, Subsection B, as well as Subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5654)|
| 1:34:24| And so, those were the original motions that Councilmember Helsley made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| Adding, I guess the question for Councilmember Helsley then is, and for everyone else is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| where would additional language be added to accommodate what Councilmember Parker has proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5676)|
| 1:34:44| On this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| I think on this document, you would simply add the additional sentence right after the two sentences that currently exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| the one sentence that occurs in B and the one that occurs in C, and they're just repeat sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| And I think that you should put at the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| Could you say the page number you're reading from and then read out the full sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| Is there a page number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| I don't have page numbers on the ones I have in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Well, let's just count them, then, so we know what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| Mr. Swenson, can I suggest that you read Councilwoman Helsley's sentence followed by the additional sentence together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| Okay, Mr. Swenson's going to read Ms. Helsley's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| However, if more than one candidate receives the highest number of votes in the primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| then only those candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall be placed on the regular ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| And then you come down and say, however, if proceeding to the regular election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5744)|
| 1:35:54| and only one candidate receives the highest number of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and more than one candidate receives the second highest number of votes in the primary election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| then the candidate receiving the second highest number of votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| and all those candidates receiving the second highest number of votes shall be placed on the regular election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| I think that does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| And that's the amendment on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| That will cover both first-place ties and second-place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| Ms. Helsley, does that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| That will go in subsection B and subsection C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| So, Ms. Helsley has said that that is the amended version of her amendment that she wishes to put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| Why don't we have a... Is there a second for that modification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for reading it out and Mr. Roberto for helping us with the page numbers and locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| How many lawyers does it take to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Apparently three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| You could ask your husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| He's definitely not involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| Anyhow, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| Ms. Helsley, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| So, does everyone understand the amendment before them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| The motion to amend passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| And now I believe Councilmember Roberto, you wanted to make a motion to read this on an emergency basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| because it has been a substantive change, but we have a time issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I will make a motion to read this on emergency as we've now adopted this language that Councilmember Parker wanted to have us add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5842)|
| 1:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| There has been a motion that has been made and seconded to read this on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| which means if it passes tonight, then it passes and would be on the ballot for the voters of Knoxville to consider in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5858)|
| 1:37:47| We're going to vote now on the motion to consider this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| We will go back to the motion as amended, reading it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Is there any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Motion carries 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| I think we should take a ten-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Let's reconvene at 748.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Ten minutes have gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| We're going to reconvene and resume our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| We'll start with Item 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5907)|
| 1:38:37| A resolution approving an appeal by Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal by Joyce Feld on behalf of Scenic Knoxville of a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| to grant variance to reduce the minimum required street frontage for a changeable price sign from 250 feet to 174.89 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5928)|
| 1:38:58| per Article 13.6.G.1 for property located at 5014 Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| thereby reversing the decision of the Board and denying the original variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| There's one person, the appellant, Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| Please come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| You'll have up to five minutes to speak to counsel on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5959)|
| 1:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| and I am here tonight as President of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| I'm going to provide some historical context for this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| and then Scenic Knoxville Board Member Kevin Murphy is going to present on the specifics of this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5986)|
| 1:39:53| So several years ago, Scenic Knoxville asked City Council to ban new electronic message centers, also known as EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=5993)|
| 1:40:04| For reference, most people are familiar with the digital on-premise sign in front of the shrimp dock on Kingston Pike in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6004)|
| 1:40:12| which actually was the city's very first electronic message sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| Council ultimately voted to ban new EMCs, but before they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| I want to emphasize there was a lot of discussion and a lot of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6023)|
| 1:40:32| which went on for weeks, if not months, and I don't know if he remembers this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| but Council Member Rob Frost even joked at the time that EMC didn't actually stand for electronic message center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6038)|
| 1:40:47| but instead it stood for every meeting considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| Do you remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| I remember it very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| Included in this discussion was what to do about a specific kind of EMC called a changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| and this is the kind of digital sign that we sometimes see at gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Council was, at that time, reluctant to ban these altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| but they also wanted to prevent a proliferation of intrusive digital signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| So the compromise that they struck from a total ban, which was the other option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| was to limit changeable price signs to parcels with a minimum of 250 feet of frontage on the street where the property is addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6087)|
| 1:41:37| So the compromise would allow some properties to have a changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| but there would not be a proliferation of them with that requirement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| So we think, Scenic Knoxville thinks, that this much discussed, very well thought out compromise has worked very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| and we ask that you approve this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| And I'm going to turn it over to Kevin. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Mr. Murphy, you didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| I did not, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Sorry, I thought this was an appeal hearing that we could do our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6128)|
| 1:42:17| If council members have questions later in their discussion, they can ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| No one has signed up to speak in opposition to this appeal, so council members...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| Can I speak for Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| If you had your opportunity, Ms. Felder, I mean, council will have its opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| I mean, we're supposed to have people sign up ahead of time for the opposition, for the pro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| Do we usually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| If you didn't use your full five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| I hear a lot of talking over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Do you guys have some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| I just was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I'm unclear when we have appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| It's always been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Mr. Johnson is telling me that only those who sign up in advance get to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| but it's always been the person who...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| The for and the against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| And so they have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| It is always the for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| It's three for, three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| No, the rules are not the same for an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| And then there's two rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| The rebuttal is the distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| And in my recollection, and apparently the same with Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| people have been asked to sign up in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| But, I mean, if counsel wants to call on these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| or wants me to call on them now, I mean, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| If you want to depart from those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| I think in fairness to the discussion earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| I would not be supportive of the second speaker unless they signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| Okay, so just know that there are other people in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| who have information they are willing to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| if counsel wants to call on them during their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Can I use the rest of my five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| Mr. Johnson, do you remember how much time she used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| Two and some change left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Okay, sure. Why don't we have two more minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| I have two more minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Approximately. I mean, that's our best estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| Okay, I didn't think I spoke that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| So this lot was a redevelopment from 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| There used to be a sign on the corner of Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| and the, I forget what the other road frontage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| but when they redeveloped, the building was torn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| and they put a new building up and they relocated the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| and they chose to locate the sign in the drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| So previously it had not been in a drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| They chose for some reason to put it in the drainage ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| but it did not have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| Also, there are other remedies that could make this situation safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| because I think that that's their primary complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| and that's that they could put wider planks on either side of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| and they could also put a railing so that it would eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| the possibility that somebody might fall off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| But as you can see from the photographs that you have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| this is not a very deep ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| I think you can see Mr. Murphy standing in front of the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| So it's not like somebody is going to fall several feet down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| if they fell off their ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| Also, there is a mechanical changeable price sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| that could be implemented here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| that would probably be less expensive to insert into their sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| than a digital changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| and that would be less obtrusive since it's not digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| and we would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| We would not oppose that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| We feel like this is not a legitimate hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| that by locating the sign in the water drainage in the ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| they created their own hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| and the sign did not have to be located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| Okay, thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| That concludes the people who have signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Is there a discussion or motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| So I would like to, with a limited amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| I'm probably going to call on Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| but Mr. Ahrens will be cognizant of my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| because I probably want to call on the applicant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| Mr. Ahrens, I'm going to speak to a point made by Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| In the packet that we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| which I don't know if Mr. Murphy or Ms. Feld have an extra packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| that they could supply to Mr. Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| so that he could follow along with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| These are multiple aerials of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| which I know you saw probably during the BZA hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| This is what's being appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| In the 2008 aerial, which is the first page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| the sign for the previous business is closer to the corner of Centerline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| and Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| What dictates where the sign has to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| It has to be on a particular frontage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Peter Ahrens, City of Knoxville Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| It's up to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| It's up to the property owner, the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| So they could put it on Centerline, they could put it on Washington Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| So previously, with the previous structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| as you can see from this 2008 aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| the sign was closer to the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| versus further down where the drainage ditch is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| You can see the shadow of the sign there in the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Is that an allowable place for the sign to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| Different sign regulations back then, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| I'm saying if the applicant – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| Let me stop for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| So the applicant filed for a variance from the sign regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| because they felt they had a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| because their sign is in a drainage ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| and they want to make it electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| so their employees don't have to stand in the drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| So when I look at the aerial, if I flip in the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| to the 2014 aerial, which is the next to last page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| the drainage ditch is not everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| The drainage ditch is different when you move closer to the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| You can see from the shadowing it's deeper in some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| than it is in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| Could the sign not be dead square centered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| in the deep trenches of the drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| Like, couldn't it move further up towards the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| where in 2008 there was a sign there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| I'm sure there are options to relocate the sign to a different area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| I haven't evaluated every opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| So that was what – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Thank you so much for this moment, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| Sir, I'm so sorry, I do not know your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| but I believe you're here for the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| I don't know –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Appellee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| Appellee is the one –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| You're the other side, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| I didn't go to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| I was not aware that we were required to sign in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| My name is Randy Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| and I'm here on behalf of Sycamore Sign Service of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| We're involved with this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| What I would have to say is the original variance that was granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| met the conditions required for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| Your Board of Zoning Appeals –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| I don't think there was a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Yes, and it's being appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| I'm simply asking counsel to consider reinstating this variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| that was overturned when Ms. Feld filed her appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| With all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| certainly nobody in the sign industry is opposed to beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| The statement was made by Ms. Feld about obtrusive gas price changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6636)|
| 1:50:43| I think that's a subjective opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Frankly, this is a static sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| It's not an electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| It is a static sign that remains on the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| It's a sign to give the current gas price until it's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| I would also say please take into consideration the public safety aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6660)|
| 1:51:08| of both the location of this sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| and the employee that has to go out and manually change these pricers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| If you can imagine the way this system works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| you've got an extendable telescopic-type pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| with a suction cup on the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| You have to affix that suction cup to a particular number, lift it, pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| This sign is maybe 10 feet off the edge of the pavement there at Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| Sir, I have five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| Can I ask you a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| Sorry, and then my colleagues can ask you questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| I hate to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| Now I have no time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| The application, if the variants stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| is your client changing the entire sign or is it just a component within the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Only the manual gas price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| So the footings that are there would remain where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| I'll let my colleagues ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| I don't see anybody else's light on at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| Oh, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Mr. Murphy, did you have anything you wanted to add to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6731)|
| 1:52:22| Thank you, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| The only things that I'd add is that the sign is in the water quality easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| They made a choice to locate the sign where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| which is located within the water quality easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| They could have put it other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| but they prioritized some of the other places for putting like air pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| fueling stations, parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| But they have lots of places on their site that they could put signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| They do have some relief keeping the existing sign and railing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| They also have relief of they could have asked for a changeable price sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| without the EMC component, but they've asked for a changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| which by the zoning ordinance here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| includes the allowance for an EMC for the price piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| We don't believe they have a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| There are not unique features to the land that present placing a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| anywhere on this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| and that's a requirement for variance in BZA and state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| You have to have a hardship that denies you use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| They have lots of options of where they could place the sign otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| If you somehow do find they have a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| we discern that this is because the property owner brought it on themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| by their site design, and that is a self-created hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| and there's well-settled case law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| particularly McClurkin v. Board of Zoning Appeals in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| that says that if you're going for a variance and claiming a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| you can't create your own hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| And finally, if you're still even at the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| well, they created a hardship, it's not theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| we just would say that if you think they need some relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| condition the relief so that they can't have the EMC component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| of the changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| So I believe the gentleman that spoke a moment ago is from the sign company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| I want to refer back to the, in our packets, page 64, 63, and 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6864)|
| 1:54:35| is the transcribed minutes from the BZA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| And the BZA meeting, the discussion was that they needed the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| because there's a hardship, because the sign numbers have to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| because it's in a drainage ditch and there are these wooden bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| which we have a picture of those in our packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| because we have a street-level view of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| What I'm having a difficult time with is a couple of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| is, you know, as Ms. Feld stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| the sign ordinance was highly deliberated and highly debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| and went on for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| And we're being asked to give a variance to our sign code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6921)|
| 1:55:30| because, based on this created hardship of where the sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| it's in the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| But what's interesting is that if you look through the years of aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| and I've looked at years of aerials on Google,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| and they go back to 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| and this is more for the shell company, not for you, the sign guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| You're the one standing here in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| But 2011, the employees had to stand on these wooden planks in a drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| 2012, 2013, 2014, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| I'm going to skip ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| 2024, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| And now it's a concern that we need to change the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| because we don't want the employees to have to stand on these wooden planks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| to change the numbers on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| And I don't understand why we have to grant a variance 13 years later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6979)|
| 1:56:27| because of the danger to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| Why was there no concern for the employees changing the numbers in all those other years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| So I think that goes back to Ms. Feld and Mr. Murphy's original thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| is there was a choice made to put the base of the sign in the drainage ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| when just a little bit further back it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| And so we made a choice a very long time ago to site the sign here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| and now we want to change it, and it's in violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| and we need a variance because we made a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| and that choice worked for 13 years, we were fine for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| but now we want to spend some money and change it, so we need a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| So I'm not inclined to support the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| which would mean I would make a motion to support the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| because it just doesn't make any sense to finally decide 13 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| I can't speak to why the current location was chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| I can tell you that there was a city of Knoxville water main close by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| so possibly the location of the sign was related to the location of utilities there at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| I can't say for certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| We were not involved in the relocation of the original pylon sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| We've simply been brought in for the customer's desire to have an electronic gas price changer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| Again, not an electronic message center with scrolling messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| or messages that change every nine seconds or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| This will be a static number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| I do not find those to be intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| I think it's an industry advancement that has gotten us away from the old days of manual price changers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| I'm familiar with some signs where a sign actually has to be accessed by a ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| You have to climb up a ladder similar to an old billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| But not only is there a danger in my mind to the employee that's out there in the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| and the sleet and snow trying to change these price numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| due to the close proximity of the edge of pavement of Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| when they're up there with these poles and these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| these things do fall off those poles occasionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| despite the best efforts of whoever's replacing the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| I feel like it poses a risk to traffic along Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| if one of the numbers was to fall on the windshield of a car passing by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| That could lead to an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| I'm not trying to oversell the safety aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| I'm just putting that out there for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| It's not only a safety issue for the employee of the convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| I feel like the point could be made that it's also potentially a risk to vehicular traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| that passes within close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Real quickly, say our ordinance doesn't ban these types of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| It just limits them to certain locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Any other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| I just would add that I'm inclined to side with Councilman Ryder's points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7168)|
| 1:59:33| that this is a hardship created by the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| You're a signed company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| You're here on their behalf, and you all do great work, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| This is a hardship that's by the company and not by the zoning code or the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| I don't believe there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| I'll make a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| A motion on the floor has been made to approve the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| which would undo the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Council Member Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| Are there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| I just wanted to share that these votes continue to be difficult for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| because the law does in many ways limit our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7217)|
| 2:00:27| If you look at the intent behind the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| it was to allow reasonable actions to move forward that might conflict with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7231)|
| 2:00:43| We've had a couple come before us where it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| I agree with the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| I completely disagree with their reasoning behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| but I agree with their thoughts around it that it's a reasonable request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| and there would be no harm to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| But our decisions have been based on that strict reading of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| that forces us to simply look at land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| and any aspects of the land that are preventing full use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7274)|
| 2:01:22| And so I hate making decisions where we're saying, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| we would rather you waste thousands of dollars to move a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| because that's what aligns with our ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| rather than to make this what seems like simple change that won't harm the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7294)|
| 2:01:40| So it's a difficult decision, but I do think the law is clear on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| and I think our Board of Zoning Appeals might need some help, a little instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| But I'm in agreement with my colleagues on this one, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| Okay, Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| No, I'm going to leave it for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| Okay, there are no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| So all those in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Okay, the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7333)|

| 2:07:21| who have been leading and helping design our plans from the get-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7641)|
| 2:07:27| which is a big reason why we got the planning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| Mr. DuBose has answered many of your questions via email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7651)|

| 2:07:48| So we got the planning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| This is to apply for the grant to actually execute, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| What's the time frame for when we might hear back on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| Well, we've basically been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| So this is the second gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| So we received the planning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| They said, okay, you're awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| You have to apply for this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| And, you know, and so we're asking for permission to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| and then also to pass it along to the sub-recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| who have been selected through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| So, Mr. DuBose or Ms. Reed, I don't know who wants to speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| could you, for the public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| could you talk about how this is going to help us expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| or do something different than what we've done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| Because what our constituents are often asking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| you can move up if you want to speak, Ms. Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| What are you adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| What are you doing more than what we've been doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| How are you addressing the problems and the people that need services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7729)|
| 2:08:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| I am so proud to come and talk with you about this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| about our progress on this grant since the last time we spoke about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| which was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| So, essentially, it's a youth-led grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| The Youth Action Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| which is made up of youth with lived experience of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| have led us to a plan that outlines two projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| that will be funded under this grant by sub-recipients in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| one for doing transitional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| and rapid rehousing specifically for youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| and then the second project is homelessness diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| and system navigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| and that will include a centralized diversion fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| for helping youth at risk of homelessness to avoid becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7776)|
| 2:09:44| And the expertise of the Youth Action Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| is helping move us toward a youth homelessness system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| that is welcoming, that is inclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| and that works for the people who need to use the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| So I'm just really proud to talk about this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| because it's going really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Well, I'm looking forward to everything getting off the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| and running and being able to help more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7805)|

| 2:11:23| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| I have a few questions for Cat if they don't mind coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7885)|
| 2:11:43| Is this a new payroll service or is this replacing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| It is actually the current one we use now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| Our contract with Unicorn ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| We went out to bid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| They reapplied, and we're getting a new contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| Okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| And we had some public forum speakers at our last meeting with some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7919)|
| 2:12:08| One of those that came out is no new contract for current CAT employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| Where do things stand with the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| The contract's not up until June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| It expires June 30th of 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| So you do have a contract in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| We have a contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| Do you have any comments about what was said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| No, not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| I'll listen to some of those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| We just had a meeting with the union this morning, so I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| Contract negotiations typically start in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| six months before the contract ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| They were concerning comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| and that's one reason why I wanted to ask this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| and see especially if we're looking at services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| to advance our human resources services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| to see if that can address any of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| It's a little bit misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| Actually, this contract doesn't provide any human resource services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| That's all done in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| Basically, what Unicorn does is it's the way we track our payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| so employees will be able to, from a benefits standpoint and payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| we're also able to submit days off through the payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| But it's a little misleading when it says HR services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| All that's done in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8005)|

| 2:13:42| and I bet you know the exact date for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| Yeah, August 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8025)|

| 2:16:29| movement to approve, I would also make a motion to substitute the updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8189)|

| 2:16:44| Is anyone signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| I'm not sure which way we should do it, but my preference would be that we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8209)|
| 2:16:57| ahead and approve the substitute so that we are all speaking on the same item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8217)|
| 2:17:07| Well, I mean, typically we've been calling people first, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8227)|
| 2:17:12| council members, do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8232)|

| 2:17:24| I mean, you said you wanted to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| We can call people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8248)|

| 2:17:45| I personally think it makes a little bit more sense to know what gets amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| and how it gets amended before we speak, but I guess while we're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| I'm generally, I guess, since we're making changes to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| might as well address everybody's concerns and just put it all up for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8279)|

| 2:18:45| please really, really start to think about and consider what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8325)|
| 2:18:53| if you vote for this, I mean, if you get this on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| and let the people decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8337)|

| 2:19:06| and how you steward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8346)|
| 2:19:14| because the truth of the matter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| having a few people outside a particular district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| make decisions, and that's basically what's been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| That is basically what's been happening for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| It has put all the isms in play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| for particular areas of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| whether we want to deal with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8385)|
| 2:19:50| So the underlying racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| that we've dealt with through the decades that I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| and had to deal with and had to kind of relearn about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| when I started trying to get involved in community stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8403)|
| 2:20:10| man, it's been rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| To repeatedly come up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| what people on city council, decision makers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8419)|
| 2:20:24| and some of the decision makers that are appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| and hired by the city, having to deal with those folk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| through the years to find out that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| no matter how well-intentioned you all are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| the communities that I've existed in in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| primarily District 6, East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| and that I have a historical connection to, District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| have kind of been left out. People have been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8461)|
| 2:21:06| And so when you have that continual situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| always up front, at least for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| I notice it. I deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| We don't have a voice within our areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| and we can't hold people accountable because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| everything is coming down on this particular district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| and now others because slowly and surely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| we've had, again, a spreading out of a predominantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| black population of East Knoxville and Mechanicsville, Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| It's now spread out literally into all districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8507)|
| 2:21:52| in Knoxville, in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| And literally you've had people filter out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| get spread out because their voices aren't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| because they've lived in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| Other people were making decisions then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| We have that seriously going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| We have that seriously going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| People's voices are not being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| I'm speaking in favor of this resolution, ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8543)|
| 2:22:32| District only, that's where we should start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| Whatever the other amendments are about tie votes and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8555)|
| 2:22:42| include it, do whatever you've got to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| But the main thing is there has to be a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| or recommitment for people within a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| legislative district voices to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| And they have to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| And you all have to start giving people a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| to want to vote, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| And not leave it up to the people who have all the big financial resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| Because that's the way things are breaking down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| It is about the money, whether we want to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| So, do what you've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| Okay, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| I am going to take...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| I probably won't take the longer time to introduce it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| because we've covered some of this already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8616)|
| 2:23:39| in the earlier discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| But I couldn't help but start out my comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| by acknowledging that the Voting Rights Act of 1965| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| was passed 59 years ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| And it just kind of gives me chills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| to think about that long legacy in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| and what is before us today to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8645)|
| 2:24:14| When I was a student in law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| I was very fortunate to be able to work for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| And I worked in their minority business section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| They have had an amazing voting rights section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| that was leading a lot of the fights around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| Working to hold cities accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| to the spirit and the letter of the law of the Voting Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| And one repeated theme that has come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| are the problem of these at-large districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| And I'm not going to repeat all the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| because our speakers tonight did a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| of going through some of that history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| and some of that case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| Where numerous cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| some when they simply adopted the electoral system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| not waiting to see what the impact was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| found their system shot down by a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8718)|
| 2:25:24| Because of the makeup of their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| Because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8727)|
| 2:25:35| percentage of minority voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| cohesive voting block that existed in their city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| similar to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| We are at a point where we will definitely have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8746)|
| 2:25:52| the regional at-large system on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| I created this ordinance to have another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| I created this ordinance as an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| to the regional system, but that has now passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8767)|
| 2:26:13| And I do believe that voters need an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| to allow multiple ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| to allow multiple measures on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| dealing with the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| We learned two weeks ago that none of them could conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| And so with my ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| you'll see that language has been removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| and language has been altered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| to ensure that the ordinances don't conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8800)|
| 2:26:43| but to achieve the same goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8803)|
| 2:26:48| And so the district-only language is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| The tiebreaker language has been updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| and we just went through what that language is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| It was read out and added to the regional at-large ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| And it deals with the ability of at-large council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| to win in the primary with 50% plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8831)|
| 2:27:20| I do not think this is the best scenario for voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| I still think that we'll have a little bit of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| to overcome in the next few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| but I do think it's important that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| the regional at-large option is put on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| that we're able to give another option for voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| that still allows them to address the tiebreaker issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| allows them to address the 50% plus one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| And then if the regional proposal does not prevail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8871)|
| 2:27:57| we would get the district-only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| So with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| there may be questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| I want to stop there and make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| so that we can consider the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| So I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| Okay, motion's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| Okay, the motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| Moving on to the next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| 12B is an ordinance approving the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| of Asylum Avenue LLC for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| to the Central City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=8916)|

| 2:30:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| I just want to make one little point here on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| This property rezoning is adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| to a little commercial node in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| It's surrounded by, kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| the entire neighborhood is LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| and so this would be the first change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| to medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| And it is adjacent to this commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| However, it is very difficult for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| to see this and not be a little concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| with the start of a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| And the appropriate way to handle this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| is through our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| and as we all know, those are a bit out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| This one dates back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| the South City Sector Plan dates back to 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| and there's quite a bit changed in the past 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| And I say all that to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| we always look at rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| based off of planning's work with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| and there's no more substantial work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| than these big plans for what they want in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| and it's been 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| and so there's new neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| and totally new neighborhood leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| So, long-winded way to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| this is just an example of why I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| we need updated sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9103)|
| 2:31:46| I know, Mayor, we've discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| and that next year, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| will be something that we collectively move towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| but the more these are out of date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| the more modernity and new development patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| surprise neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9120)|
| 2:32:01| and they're not really sure how to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| how the area's going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| And one-off requests does not set us up for success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9125)|
| 2:32:10| with the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| to feel good about the way the neighborhood's going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| So, long way to say the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| South Haven neighborhood, is okay with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| but they'd like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| a well-thought-out plan around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| what's the next 13 years going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| So, just to plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| Just while I'm at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| I would like to make a motion to consolidate items 12E, F, and G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9152)|
| 2:32:39| Okay, motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| I guess a substitute motion to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| Is it substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| Anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9167)|
| 2:32:58| I think we can just vote on a consolidated motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9178)|

| 2:33:04| we'll move forward with voting on all three at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9184)|

| 2:35:08| I would love for him to come down to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9308)|

| 2:35:19| 418 North Broadway is our address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| We have been fortunate enough to address an issue that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9323)|
| 2:35:28| at 418, and all of you I'm sure are aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| that the increase in homelessness over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| and especially in our women's section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| we've had an increase of 60 to 70 percent of women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| and women with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| Trying to get ahead of the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| we decided that we needed to make space for that population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| at 418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| In order to do that, we were very fortunate to find the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| at 2909 North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| and that is where we relocated all our administrative offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| That property is now zoned as O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| and we are looking for a CG2 zoning in order to give us the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| opportunity to do more of what we do at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| This change will not allow us to have any overnight housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| nor did we have any intent to ever do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| We've had the wonderful pleasure to meet with the Lincoln Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| and Oakwood Homeowners Association just recently to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| questions and concerns they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| That meeting went very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| So what we will be is it's mostly administrative offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9397)|
| 2:36:43| We hope that we can expand our abundant life kitchen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| There is a small kitchen facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| but that is a catering operation that we have operating now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9408)|
| 2:36:53| and it's just difficult to operate that out of the kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| that serves our population at 418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| Microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| The meeting that was Monday was very well received by all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9425)|
| 2:37:06| There were some concerns among some of the neighbors about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9426)|
| 2:37:11| the project would entail, and I think you did an excellent job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| of allaying those fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| I specifically wanted to call you to the podium because not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| everybody was at that meeting, and I wanted them to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| chance about what your plans were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9448)|
| 2:37:29| Just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| The building as is, is it going to take major changes in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| building, or basically are you going to be able to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9455)|
| 2:37:38| building as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| No, basically we'll use it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| If we need to expand any type of kitchen facility to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| we could do that, but right now we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| hopefully, space to grow in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| I just wanted to add a little context to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| This goes back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| At one point, there was a rezoning activity brought by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9476)|
| 2:38:01| Walmart's Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| This was several years ago on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| and a lot of people, including myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| had questions about it, and after a lot of discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| opposition, the Walmart Express actually withdrew that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| I want to, I could raise other issues about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| but I want to talk a little bit about sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| is because if the Walmart Express had come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| this building would have been torn down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| and all the material in that building would have gone into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| dump, and then a new building would have been built with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| resources, and one of the most, least earth-friendly thing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| can do is demolish and then rebuild,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9521)|
| 2:38:45| and because the neighborhood got active and we had some patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| and Walmart actually voluntarily withdrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| over the years we found a much better use for that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240806?start=9532)|
