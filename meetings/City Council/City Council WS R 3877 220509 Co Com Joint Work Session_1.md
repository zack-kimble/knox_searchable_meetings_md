| 2:07:00| Again, what we're funding actually replaced more than the 98 beds that were available at Lakeshore, so I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7620)|
| 2:07:08| But I know that Liz and the other hospital representatives who will probably want to come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| will explain that they might have the bed capacity but not the staffing capacity to staff the beds that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7633)|
| 2:07:21| But that's for them to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| Could some of the providers answer the bed capacity that you have for somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| including maybe somebody on behalf of Marcus and Ben who's not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| I can't speak for Marcus and Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| Maybe for yourself and we'll go down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| For Peninsula, we are only staffed right now for 63 beds, but we have 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7656)|
| 2:07:45| So if we had the staff, we would be able to take up to 90 patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7665)|
| 2:07:57| As far as Marcus and Ben goes, they have 165 beds there at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| Whenever Lakeshore closed, we expanded bed capacity thereafter to add an additional 15 beds, taking it from 150 to 165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7684)|
| 2:08:13| And how many of those beds are available now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| All 165.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Excuse me, how much room is there at the Marcus and Ben end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| Obviously, that's going to fluctuate day by day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| But I believe as of this morning, there was approximately 120 was there on the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7703)|
| 2:08:31| And then there's obviously those who have been referred that were making way for those individuals to come in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| Just a couple quick anecdotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| Permanent supportive housing is obviously a stable foundation before crisis, after crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| And so I look around the room and see some folks who care for people in all stages of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| There's just not enough places for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| So I wasn't aware also, so I learned tonight that the state funds some permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| And so I think there's enough probably workforce for those type of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| And so I think either before crisis or after crisis, permanent supportive housing is not something that either the city or county or state alone can fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7752)|
| 2:09:22| I encourage all of us to continue to be focused on that prize because housing will be the place where it falls short before or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7762)|
| 2:09:31| So thank you for all of you that are committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| I know the city, all of us here, we're proud to commit $50 million to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7774)|
| 2:09:41| Our skin's in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| And so everybody else has played their role as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| So I just think housing has to be critical to all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| So thank you for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7793)|
| 2:09:54| And I really appreciate how engaged everybody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| And obviously we've gone a little bit over on time, so we'll just continue with our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| But I would ask everyone to be brief in their questions going forward to be respectful of everyone's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7803)|
| 2:10:12| Okay, next up we have Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| And thank all of you for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| It's really been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| Councilman Smith and Mr. McKenzie both asked questions that were pertinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| So this question is going to be a little bit more of just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| I just want to really make sure I've got a grasp of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| So I've got a clarification question from Ms. Williams, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7834)|
| 2:10:44| Now I understand when Lakeshore closed, then the present population of the patients, they were dispersed to different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7844)|
| 2:10:54| Could you explain again where those folks went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| We had 98 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| Our department, in tandem with the providers that are here today and providers that are not here today, went through that whole list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7861)|
| 2:11:09| And depending upon that person's needs, they got put close to where their home was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| So, for example, Jerry Vagner, Helen Ross McNabb created permanent, supportive residential treatment with 24-7 staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7875)|
| 2:11:26| And some of those residents went there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| And I think what I was trying to make sure you were clear about, only one person came back to the hospital from that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7888)|
| 2:11:37| I mean, think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| That's a good use of taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7899)|
| 2:11:42| That's a good quality of life for that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| They're not in a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| They're actually in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| They're in the community still today being overseen by Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| Some individuals weren't ready to be discharged, so they actually got referred to Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute, so they went there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7912)|
| 2:12:00| But the majority went to these local providers that that spreadsheet, when you get it, you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| I mean, we actually detail by provider how many units they created, and that shows you how many people actually went to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7926)|
| 2:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| That's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| So that system is essentially pretty much in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| And not only is that system in place, we've actually expanded housing across this community through the Creating Homes Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| Actually, I was talking to Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| He got funding through that in this last go-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| So we're leveraging dollars to increase even more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| So when I showed you that you have $45 million in this community, that's over and above what came here when we closed Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7958)|
| 2:12:46| We continue to bring in dollars to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| And what I think I just heard from various providers, right at this moment, there are available beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7970)|
| 2:12:57| Yes, sir, there are, and I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| You will hear that people are waiting for days in the emergency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| I saw that you guys put up their 53-hour wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| That's up to two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| I will tell you, I sit on the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| My other fellow commissioners would love to be in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| They've got people waiting for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| They've got people waiting at some points for 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| I hate that anybody waits any length of time, but when you combine COVID and what happened in our emergency departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8005)|
| 2:13:33| you understand it's not just a mental health issue, it's a health population issue that converged together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8013)|
| 2:13:41| So at this moment, if you looked across our system, you would see there are enough beds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| but the issue is are they staffed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| You've got the bed, but if you don't have the staff, you can't pay the person, as Liz spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8031)|
| 2:13:58| They're not able to run all those beds, even though they're licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| and even though when we were able to meet the market demands, we could run all those beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8042)|
| 2:14:08| Okay, so I understand you may have the bed, but you don't have the staff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8048)|
| 2:14:15| Right now, are there places that have the beds and the staff that are available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| Absolutely, and those individuals are here today that could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| In our state hospital, Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| we do have the beds and we do have the staff right now for today's need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| I can't tell you if that's not going to change in two weeks, three weeks, but for today, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| No, you answered my question very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| I've got a bit of a follow-up now, and so this is what I'm trying to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8081)|
| 2:14:46| and by asking this question, I absolutely do not underestimate the challenges and complexities of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8086)|
| 2:14:55| Every day we see mentally ill on the street in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| and what the challenge is and what, if you could talk a little bit about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| and maybe Bruce Spangler could too, is we have available places for them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8107)|
| 2:15:17| We have mentally ill people that are homeless on the street right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| What's the path to getting these people out here on the street into those beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8124)|
| 2:15:30| A couple things, and again, I'll ask the providers to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| We fund our providers to do a PATH program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| It's called the Project to Transitional Housing for Individuals that are Homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| It does outreach, and so I was a PATH worker 31 years ago in Memphis, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| and I can tell you to me that's the answer, having people that go out on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8146)|
| 2:15:52| talk to individuals that are homeless and say, hey, you don't have to stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| but you've got to remember not everybody wants to take you up on that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| Not everybody trusts you to come in and get that help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| which is why when Ben's talked about the peer specialist, when I was working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| we didn't have peer specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| We didn't have a licensing thing to do peer specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| I wish I'd had them then because those are people that have lived that walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| have been homeless, and can actually encourage the person to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8178)|
| 2:16:22| So combining that with peer specialists is the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| but also recognizing some individuals aren't ready to go with what's available for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8186)|
| 2:16:33| But I'd really turn that over to Jerry and Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8193)|
| 2:16:41| I know you know the complexity of the issue of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| That's no secret in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| There are a number of people that we outreach to and that we engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| and we connect with CARM and VMC and other places to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| but not everybody's ready, and that's really, really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| The other thing I would suggest that our community has to sort of grapple with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| in my opinion, is there are different types of homeless people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| and there are different situations that got them there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| and different motivation as to whether they want to remain there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| or whether they want to move out of that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| And I think Bruce said it well when he said they're all individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| and if we start there, we can kind of make inroads on an individual basis about how to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| But we do love our individual rights in this state, and I really want to underscore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| So these are people who are competent, by and large, to make decisions for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| So it's a hard force to, even though we can see that it would be really helpful to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8258)|
| 2:17:51| I'll briefly add that through the city funding, and especially through COVID money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8271)|
| 2:17:57| we increased our street outreach from two to six over the past year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| But what it does, we have a resident who's lived at Menvella now for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| but prior to that he had been on the streets for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| It took six years of engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| It took six years of benevolent nuisance with this gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| to somehow or another begin to deal with the ambivalence and the ambiguity of his experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| It does take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| I've always been told you can't push a string,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| but at the same time to continue to have that benevolent nuisance really makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8310)|
| 2:18:39| I do want to say that with COVID money leaving that we stand to lose some funding of the six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| and so we are appealing to the state for some money for the endemic stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| to make sure that we continue that outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| Well, thank you so much because that kind of appeared to me to be the weak link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8334)|
| 2:19:01| or what we should really be focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| It's frustrating, of course, to have the available beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| and you have people on the street that obviously could benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| but you did a really good job of explaining, I think, the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| and the individual differences that people have and the attitudes they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| They are all individuals, but you helped me right then understand a lot about why we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8365)|
| 2:19:34| that appear at least to us to be mentally ill and on the street in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| and why maybe we can't help them or they don't choose to be helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8380)|
| 2:19:47| There's a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| There's a total judgment call on each individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| So I'll just end with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| It's a complex issue, and I appreciate your challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| but I think you helped me understand kind of where we need to focus our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8398)|
| 2:20:06| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| I'm going to go to Councilmember Ryder, who had her light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| and then we'll close with Senator Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| I'm not used to sitting on this side, and I swear this mic is further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Like Commissioner Bussler, I have pages of notes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| and I'm not really sure what I'd like to talk about in the limited 30 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| and I'm probably going to get to talk since we're way over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| You know, we've heard a lot tonight about housing, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| and I'd like to point out that the city has limited land to add more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| We don't have the land mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| So, you know, we do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| And then we've heard a lot about workforce vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| So I think, you know, we could go down that pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| That would be one question that I could have you guys answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| I'd just like to say, obviously not to have you answer that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| but I'm wondering what you guys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| I don't want anybody to jump up and answer it because we don't have time to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| because I'm going to get to another question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| is maybe alternative pathways to fill some of the vacancies you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| This is clearly an employee market, no matter what industry you're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| And payer mix in Tennessee and healthcare payer mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| You guys have all touched on payer mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| Until we get payer mix change and higher Medicaid reimbursement rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| which I hope that you guys need us to lobby the congressman that helps our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| that go federal that can touch that, then that's what we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| And I'm assuming you guys have lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| But until the payer mix goes up, you can't pay the workers more to staff all the beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| and get the healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| It got really bright in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| So, anyway, I would love to talk about a million things off my list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| but I'll just throw those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| Could I have someone talk about the mental health court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| Because I think that's something new-ish we're looking at in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| So that's what I'll focus my energy on, if anybody wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| So I've heard Char Malin mention that she was meeting with, recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| at a panel that we were both at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| She was meeting with someone to do a mental health court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| because I don't believe we have one in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| So could someone explain to me what the time frame is for getting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| and what impact that might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| Though I would love to sit here and talk about payer mix and how we're covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8546)|

| 2:22:32| Let's talk about the mental health court, because that's all I'm going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| Thanks, Ms. Ryer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8555)|
| 2:22:36| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| Tennessee has a lot to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| One of the many things is our recovery court programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| We have 82 recovery courts in the state that have primarily focused on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| living with substance use disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| We have specialty courts focused on veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| We have family drug courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| But for this coming year, we've been funded, I think it's about $5.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| to stand up approximately 45 mental health treatment courts across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| And I'll tell you, from our experience working with leaders in the judicial system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| when you partner a judge with a treatment provider in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| great things happen as far as retention and treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| as far as helping people find employment, find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| So as far as the timeline, ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| We've got folks back at the department now building out the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| There's already a model in place for recovery courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| A lot of the mental health court work will be modeled after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| But I think our hope is to get the dollars out the door ASAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| so we can fund communities who want to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| And so that's coming out of your department's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| And really quickly, because I was doing some math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| What is that budget number again that Commissioner gave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| Ms. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8639)|

| 2:24:04| Commissioner Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8644)|

| 2:24:16| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| All right, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8658)|

| 2:24:21| We don't have mental health courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| We have recovery courts, but we don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| There's a small handful of mental health courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| that have been created outside of our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| but this will be the first foray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| as far as the department investing in mental health courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| Okay, and that will be a form of diversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| and it will keep people from getting kicked off their TennCare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8676)|
| 2:24:42| when they get incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| The recovery court's all about helping support people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| with behavioral health issues in a setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8689)|

| 2:24:54| and that's in the community, in treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| under the supervision of a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| That's the model that we're going to replicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| with the mental health courts, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| Okay, so real quickly, what are the numerical impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| of what you would expect from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| Like how many people is it going to touch or help per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| differently than what it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| That's yet to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| I think it depends on which 45 communities we fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| but I'll tell you, looking at what we fund currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| with recovery courts, we see notable improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| in housing stability, notable improvements in employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| and anecdotally what we hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| and we go to recovery court graduations all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| when you see these folks graduating from recovery court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| and they've got their family members in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| and you see those relationships repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| that speaks volumes to how important this program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| So we fully anticipate seeing similar outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| to what we've seen over the past...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| I don't know, how many years we've been funding recovery courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| It came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| It was funded through FNA prior to it coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| so we've had it for maybe 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| Yeah, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| For recovery courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8766)|
| 2:26:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8768)|

| 2:27:24| and get them the help they need early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| it will help prevent them from being in the pipeline later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| We talked about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8851)|

| 2:27:48| It's kind of just throwing something against the wall to see if it sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| But it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| I think it's important for all of us to look at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| we can get the bureaucracies out of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| so these providers can do the work that they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| Regarding Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| those 50 people that are in permanent housing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| versus being at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| have a much higher quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| They're in a small living situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| as opposed to kind of almost a major big hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| And the thing about it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| with the size of Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| the average daily cost that we were spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| to take care of somebody at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| was significantly higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| And so that's how we're able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| the state is able to spread those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8917)|
| 2:28:40| for the folks that were kind of the revolving door people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| So hopefully to prevent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| from needing permanent long-term supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| And that's something that's not really ever talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| I actually, before I was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| even before Lakeshore was closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| I visited Lakeshore because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| we had occasionally a couple of folks from Sertoma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| would need to go to Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| And I saw what it was like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| And I know the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| that those people are existing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| And I know when we closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| the intellectual disability places like Green Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| the quality of life that increased for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8956)|
| 2:29:19| Being in smaller homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| and having choices that they couldn't have in a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8961)|
| 2:29:25| was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| But I think the big thing is that average daily cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| and being able to spread it to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| But I still will keep them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| And we will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| I hadn't really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| I guess we haven't been doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| but we will make sure that chart gets to all the delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| and we can get it to commission and council too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| so you can share it and see what it's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| so we can all keep them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| So that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| There was mentioned the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| They didn't say the words, but the Medicaid wage index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| That's one of the reasons why our pay level...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| It's not just in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| although East is less than the rest of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| but Tennessee has one of the lowest Medicaid wage index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| And it's a federal fund that's figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| And so if we do a good job managing our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| which we typically do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| they pay us a lower wage index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| And we finally, a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| got a small increase in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| which was the first one we'd gotten in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| We had been talking to our federal representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| to try to help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| There's some great programs that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| We are the models, even in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| that are happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| And these partnerships, it's unheard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| for all our hospitals to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| and work on what we're going to be doing at St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| because they're very competitive with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| And so to see the need and to come together and work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| I applaud your efforts to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| But the last thing I'm going to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| is the workforce challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| Like I say, Commissioner Williams was able to get an increase there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| I know Senator Briggs helped pass some legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| that was passed this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| to help fund, through the Tennessee Promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| some certificate programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| Some of these will be health care workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| that maybe are four-month, five-month, six-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| that weren't funded in the Promise before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| They also funded some more residency slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| that will help get us a few more psychiatrists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| One thing that I did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| we are getting ready to start a health care task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| that is not going to just look at mental health professions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| but a lot of the weakness in the staffing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| is our direct support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| the people at the ground level trying to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| And I think it's important that we, you know, it's for mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9118)|
| 2:32:03| it's for children's services, it's for elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| You know, we've got that Renaissance Towers that closed in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| or is closing, you know, all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| but it's that ground-level support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| And so this health care task force is going to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| kind of salary studies in other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| but also who those providers are looking for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| Who's their competition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| Is it the McDonald's, and how much is McDonald's paying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| So to try to give the governor and the finance chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| and the speakers the data that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| so these groups don't have to keep coming back each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| Do we need to do an annual raise increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| when we give state employees a raise increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| So they don't go 10 years without, or 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| or whichever one it is in that particular field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| But we need to get that real data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| and it's going to take a little while on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| but we're going to hopefully get the information we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220509-co-com-joint-work-session?start=9177)|
