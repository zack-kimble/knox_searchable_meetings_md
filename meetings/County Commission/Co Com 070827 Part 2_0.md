| 0:00:00| Our citizens are better for having you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| We've praised private sector money for senior summits, education summits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4)|
| 0:00:09| neighborhood conferences, movies on the mall, jazz festivals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9)|
| 0:00:14| Imagination Library, and first day festivals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=14)|
| 0:00:18| I think they're all good initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=18)|
| 0:00:20| We sought private sector donations for FluMist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:27| It didn't cost us a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:29| Last year we vaccinated 35,000 school children free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:35| Our record keeping wasn't good, but our results were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=35)|
| 0:00:42| I support the grant process and the work that you've done in funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| There's just a couple examples that I want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| The Knoxville Volunteer Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| My first real experience with them was when we had a mudslide in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:02| I stood in a rescue line with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| and saw two of their members go into a house that was turned completely upside down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| risk their lives, and pull out one of our fellow citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| They didn't do it where they could be on talk radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| or above the fold in the newspaper or to lead the 6 o'clock news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| They did it because it was the right thing to do to help fellow citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| The grant that goes to them is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| We ought to do more. It's well-deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| I've heard some complaints about TenCorp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| Let me tell you about one of their programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| It's called Moms VIP, Volunteers in Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| It works with city mothers or expectant mothers who are pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| It makes sure they get proper neonatal care, parenting classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| And when our newest citizens leave the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| they make sure they're riding in a car seat instead of somebody's lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| There's been a lot written and said about conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| I want to step back from that and applaud those who serve on nonprofit boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| We need more people doing it, not fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| We spent a lot of time, effort, energy on lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| It's paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| $19 million more dollars not just this year, but every year going forward on the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=148)|
| 0:02:35| $900,000 to the Emergency 911 Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| And through a lot of dedicated efforts, we're able to get legislation changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| which really allowed us to manage the pension plan for our deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:56| These things I mention aren't my accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Rather, accomplishments of a community for a while, for the first time in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| is really committed to working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| When you look at the money we've spent, if you were to do a return on investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| it would make any corporation in America proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| Again, make no mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| We've made errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| We've been really short on process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| We've been good on results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| We'll do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| In closing, I thought Pastor Green had a really good prayer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=216)|
| 0:03:47| He talked about time to heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| Time is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| If I've contributed to this in the past, I'm sure in some ways I have, I extend my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| It's time to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| I'm not going to participate in any interrogations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| I'm not going to add to confusion that has hampered us for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| I hope you won't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| There are some that don't like the way I do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Some don't like my style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| It will be open in three years, and I'll have an opportunity to run for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| But in that interim, let's pull it back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Let's get some things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| We'll work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| We'll work with Mr. Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| We'll do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=293)|
| 0:05:13| Commissioner Ballard first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I think he's got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Lewis, I'd like to thank you for being a citizen, a concerned citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| and taking the time and effort that you did to put these reports together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| And I just hate that it's under these circumstances that you had this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| I have several concerns, not about your report or yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| and maybe I'm going to ask you for a recommendation at the end of several questions that I'd like to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=337)|
| 0:05:46| Undoubtedly, I guess this is sort of forensics accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| It's when you go back and recreate the way that you've recreated your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| Would that be a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Well, there are records missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| And so you use some intuitive and you go back and you start looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| And in the private and the governmental section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| I imagine that sometime you've appeared in court and qualified as an expert witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| I've been an expert witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| And so you know a lot of workings of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| I was an expert witness in the SIBC loan fiasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| So you can just tell it through your reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| Now, when you look through these records and all the items that were there, how far did you go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=385)|
| 0:06:33| I looked at what was made available to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| And this is not the way you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| You start at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| What did we expend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| I didn't look at it that way because that wasn't made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| I looked at what the press was looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| I have not done an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I've done a review of what was made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| And I think it's very, very clear that if any of you all took one hour of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| and looked through these documents, and these documents will fit into, I say, a dull banana box, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| that you would come to the same conclusions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| And I guess that's really what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| We went back to 203 to 207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And we've had people come in, the press, my good buddy Paul Pinkston here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| It seems like citizens, you come out of retirement and looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| And, you know, we've got a report in December that said everything looked pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| That was on a sample basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Would this have occurred under your watch that this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| you give us about a rain of paper and a docket of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| Would this have occurred under your watch that it went undetected for a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Because of the internal controls, Knox County's own policies and procedures were not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| You know, Mr. Ragsdale, for just one of his most important duties under the Charter 3.03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| he is the chief fiscal officer of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| And I will say to you right now, based on what I've seen as to his management of his own office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| he has not done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| But I want to be proactive and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| we're looking at ways to change the community grants and the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| and how do you apply and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| But we also have an audit department that should catch this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| and you just said that it wouldn't occur under your watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| I would have run things differently, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| So in the recommendation that I mentioned that we can prevent this because it's a steward and a fiduciary position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| overlooking the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| It's always, you know, you've got to remember, it's always management's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| It's not the auditor to catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| For example, the P-card program that Mr. Warner and Mr. Ragsdale put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| Well, let me show you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Well, just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Let's ask for mine and I'll answer the mayor's at this time if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| Is that your signature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| What's your signature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I'm just getting back to the point that this wouldn't occur under your watch and if you were an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| And we're changing a lot of things that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| I don't want to see this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| I'm not satisfied that we've not completed the total audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| because I think of all the P-cards and you've limited yours to the first 175.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| I've only limited what was in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| That's all that's been made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| We've spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| I think that we need to get everything audited and out on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| But what I'm asking is, and you have qualified an expert, is how come our audit department has not caught this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=588)|
| 0:09:57| Well, because I'll be honest with you, the records are inaudible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| As to Mr. Ragsdale's own office, credit card expenditures, records are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=601)|
| 0:10:12| Documents are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| There was not a single travel expense report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Accounting documents stand on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Who, what, when, and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| But with as many transactions as went on, we've went in just like a heat-seeking missile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| and found the lobster meal or whatever we want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| We've just went in and identified many, many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| And this is by ordinary citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| And I asked again, how come, to talk about random sampling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| how is it that they're able to go in and do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| now random sampling over the scores and scores of the investigation has not detected this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| I haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| I want to say to the committee, you know, that's not really good enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| We need to bring this to a conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| We need to audit everything and bring this to a conclusion and not drizzle it out over months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| I think people in Knox County want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I agree with you, Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| And my suggestion, because you've got to remember, the person that used the credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| they used it initially when they gave it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| They had an opportunity to correct it when the procurement document was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| And Mr. Ragsdale has instructed all of his employees and his staff to go through the documents one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| reimburse the county for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| And then he brought in Mr. Vandiver, an ex-FBI agent, to look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:38| And he said everything was reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| So it's been four times that it's looked at before I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| But I think we're talking two streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| What you did in regards to the mayor, you've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| What I'm looking at is a proactive stance that we discover it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| and we don't have to take you out of retirement sitting in the coffee and reading the paper in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| And somebody in this building can come up and tell me why over four years it wasn't detected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| And I think that's a proactive thing that this entire commission needs to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| And this has been drizzled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| I can't think of any investigation that we don't go in and look at the total thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| We have 350 cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| You know, I made a recommendation to Mr. Walls last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| I said, I'd like to see the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| If I recommend to appropriate the money and bring in five CPAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| can we get to the end of this within the next two to three weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| He didn't want to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| He didn't want me to make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I don't know how that goes on with the comptroller and all these other investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| But I think we need to get the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| and then go to the people that we suspect of wrongdoing or inappropriate or sloppy management, whatever that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| If you want to really get it over with quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Well, not quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| We want a good investigation, but a quick investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Okay, I want a quick investigation that doesn't cost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| If you do that, have the staff complete the TERs, the exact same thing they're doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| then compare it to what we paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| And the difference, they pay back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Is their audit department sufficiently staffed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| And what, well, that's a recommendation that I asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| You know, I asked you for some proactive recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| So how many would it take to do the job so this doesn't go undetected again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| You're going to bring in from the state comptroller's office, the division of county audit, people that do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| And they can be brought in and assist Mr. Walls to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| And they are very, very thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| I'll be totally satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| But you're going to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| It's going to cost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Well, I guess that's what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| How many staff do we need through the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Permanent staff or part-time staff to do that where we don't have to bring in the state comptrollers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I'm going to tell you right now, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| But we need more than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| You've got Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| You've got a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Is it an intern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| There's one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It was the same staffing when I was here 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I hope the commission sees I'm going down two different streams here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| What he did, the mayor, is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| It speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Why we haven't caught this and we can have people coming off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| Zeroing in on everything is just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| It doesn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| If you want to call that competency, that's what you can call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| But I think after some of these other issues die down, this needs to be relooked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| And I appreciate your time at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Okay, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Hang on, Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Commissioner Leuthold and Commissioner Trammell and then you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| I don't know if the mayor or John Troyer could answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| We pay for an outside audit firm to come in every year and audit our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| How was this undetected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| How did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| How did the we pay good money for an outside firm to come in and review our records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| And how did they miss this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| Mr. Crosby, if you can answer that or if anybody can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| You're going to have to talk to somebody from finance or the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:44| I don't really feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| We make our work available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Years ago we didn't have internal auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| They weren't even available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| And what has happened is that I think I've acknowledged that we've had some shortcomings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| I don't know how many times you want me to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| I'm not talking about your shortcomings necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| I'm talking about the shortcomings of the firm that we paid good money to come in and review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| I feel that Knox County, and possibly you as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| has not been served very well by the firm that's been auditing our records for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| Well, I'm not going to be critical of them when I've got so much on my plate that I could have done better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| But with that being said, I'm very respectful of the point you make, and I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| You know, I don't know when we're going to, and I know we do it every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| but I think that we do need to find a new audit firm for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| I can tell you, Knox County, while I was auditing Knox County in the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| about 1982 or 83 was the year they hired the first internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| and I think there's been one ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| I'm not going to dispute you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| And we probably do need to increase the staff underneath Richard Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| But I also think we need to also be very disappointed in that an outside auditor didn't catch some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| It's what we pay them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| It's always the management's responsibility first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| And I'm not forgiving, you know, or forgetting that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| But it's also part of theirs to try to find where things are being done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| Commissioner, we pay $207,000 for that audit is what we pay annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| We've obviously paid too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| We have months of statement missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Is that right, Mr. Cosby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| We have statements missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| What is our document retention policy, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| We can't just get rid of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| We have to go through a clearinghouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I think we've got every bank statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I think it's all on computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| Mr. Holt, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Are our bank receipts all computerized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| For the last year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Mr. Walls, are you missing any statements looking through your procurement card audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Now, we have received the statements that we're missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| and we had to go to First Tennessee and the other bank to get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| So we do have the ones that we're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| In some cases, in some of the months that appeared to be missing, there were no transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| So we do have those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| And we've received receipts piecemeal over the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| We received some maybe a month into the audit, and then a few more maybe the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:16| and we've got some receipts as recent as last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| So we're still working on the information that's still coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Mr. Mayor, you are amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| You're very well spoken, and you have done some great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| And by your own admission, you have had some shortcomings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| But everything that you speak of as being a success in some eyes are not a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| And I don't want to get into the loss in software that was supposed to save us $700,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| and it's cost us millions, and now it's shelved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| I don't want to get into some of the things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| we could debate back and forth about that this body has funded and that has been failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| But I think what Mr. Cosby and a lot of people are upset about is you are the chief financial officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| And as you have said, the buck stops with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| And I, just like you, you know, I wish we weren't asking these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| I wish we could move on and do some more great things, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| But we've got to get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| And, evidently, we have had statements missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| It's been confirmed by Mr. Walls now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| He's had to go to the banks and get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| I would suggest that you folks do everything you possibly can to make this as painless as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:54| on us as well as yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| You know, help us get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| You have the information that they need to finish their audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| It's blatantly clear, blatantly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| In your own words, things have been done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| And we have had some great successes in this county, and we have more in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| But we have to get this moment behind us the quicker the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| And no matter what it shows or what's happened, let's face it and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| This is for you, Mr. Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| I'm not an auditor or CPA or anything, but I want to ask you about Richard Walls back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| He does a random audit with just the staff that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| When the supervisors are signing off on these things, would it not be awfully hard for him to catch them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| In some cases, that was one of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Instead of the supervisor signing off, it went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| In other words, Margie Lloyd approved things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Requeta Bone approved Cynthia Finch's expense reports in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| That's not the way you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| You go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| And somebody that is reviewing it is higher up reviewing it, looking with an eye and saying, is that proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| If those things had been done, we wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| That's what I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| I want to defend Richard back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I've read Mr. Walls' reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| He is right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| I also called Mr. Walls before I went out and looked at the first document to make sure I was not interfering with what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| Another thing I want to ask you, you being a former CPA and auditing accounting and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| would it have been ethical for you or the company you worked for at that time to have given money to a slush fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Do you think that that possibly could be the reason that these audits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| You don't think them giving the money could have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| It wouldn't affect them in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| It's always up to your own personal ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| I wouldn't have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| But I don't think, and there's been two contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| You know, one was in the Hall Shopper Weekly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| I don't think that's going to compromise their integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| But, you know, it's always the appearance that you have to be worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| There's two that we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| I'd just like to say I want to compliment our auditor, Richard Walls, and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| I mean, they do a great job with the staff they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Also, the mayor and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Mayor, I don't think anybody on this commission would disagree that we've had great success over several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:58| But we've had some problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| I think, like everybody else, we want to get through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| We want to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| But I haven't heard anything today that gets us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| I think what I said will get you going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Well, it will get us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| If you will do what I say and have the staff complete those reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| and give Mr. Walls and the Division of County Audit something to audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I am telling you, field work-wise, probably two weeks, and then they've got to do a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| This will get it behind us, and we'll move forward just like Mr. Ragsdale always says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| let's move the county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| This is a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| Mr. Chairman, the state comptroller's office is already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| They're here and working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| I met with them on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| He said, we're going to do everything we can to make it available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And I appreciate what you had to say as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| You know, I think it appears to me that we have people that work for you and are very capable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1493)|
| 0:25:04| They've won awards across the country with purchasing and finance and some other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| So I'm not going to call them to the podium and start asking them questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| but I think people have caught these things in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| and someone in senior staff did management override on these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| Because I know somewhere down the line someone has to catch these purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| We just go deal with the purchasing cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| I think they review those credits probably every day, and they see things that are inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:48| So I think there's probably three or four people in Knox County government that gets those charges and look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| Now, we asked Cynthia Finch during budget in May or June, I don't know when it was, if all of the grants were in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:07| the paperwork were complete, and that you were recommending them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And today we see that some of them were incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| The applications, you're shaking your head no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Mr. Walls pulled a sampling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Mr. Walls, when you pulled a sampling of the grants, were all the information completed that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:34| Now, when we first looked at the records, no, they weren't complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| But by the time we got to the budget approval, they had been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| Well, but some of them didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| It's not a 501C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| I know, but the matching mentors basically, you know, I don't want to sit up here today and say where the money went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| I think you all know where the money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| The money last year went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| And I asked you last month, Mr. Mayor, if anybody on staff was still getting a car allowance with a county-owned vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| And you told me no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| In fact, you're still getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Mr. Chairman, if I'll do the respect, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| And I'm afraid you know that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Okay, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| You've asked me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I'd like to finish if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| What has happened, back to the days of Dwight Kessel, there's always been an expense for account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| I've worked with Mr. Troyer to keep it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| You all voted on it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And it's something that I didn't institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| And I'll let him speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| He's researched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| It started with Dwight Kessel, went through Tommy Shumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| I inherited it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I'm not saying other people didn't do it, but the issue was during the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Don, I'll let you speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Well, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| During the budget process, in your office budget, it said auto allowance $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:07| Mr. Chairman, I don't know what it said, but it's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| And I've never viewed it as an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| I've used it to pay for flowers at funerals, buy tickets for charitable events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| We've spent it each and every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| And we've itemized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| And we have to for the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Am I correct in saying it's been there much before I arrived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| But how much was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Was it $20,000 always?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| No, it's been started out, I think, probably over the years a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| It's gone to $20,000 for the past I'm not sure how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| It's been 12, 16, and I think it's been four years at $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| The only other question I've got, and like I say, you've done great things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| and this commission has done a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| And we're not wanting to, you know, jump on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| We've got to get to the bottom and move on so the people in Knox County will have trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| in their government that everything's going to be accounted for in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| So you're not getting a $20,000 anything in your paycheck anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| I'm getting a expense allowance that's been here since Mr. Kessel was in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I'm not getting a car allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| In my mind, I never have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Now, how it's been coded, I'll let Mr. Troyer speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| but we can send you a memo clarifying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| It's not something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| It's been there for decades, over two decades, nearly three decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| Well, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Well, hang on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| John, we also give you, Mr. Mayor, in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| and John can answer it, a $50,000 basically expense account slash grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| What's that money used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| The mayor has allowed a certain amount of flexibility in that line item that you're asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| and I'd like to say that also Richard Wallace has got an audit in process about this expense allowance question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| and we are responding to that audit, and that's coming up here very, very soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| and I think that would be our best point of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Again, you've done great things, and over the past several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| you've heard that there's hatred in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| I don't think anybody has hatred toward anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| I certainly like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| I see your wife back there, and I hope Claudia is doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| I think we all like each other, but we want what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| So, at the end of the day, there might be tough questions, and there may be some good answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| But, you know, we've got to get all this out and get it behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| So, Commissioner Lambert, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| Yeah, well, go ahead and finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Oh, I'm done for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I'm done for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Well, I think Larry was before me, and then Mr. Pinkston, and then it would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Start down on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Mr. Pinkston, you want to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| This is for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| John, on that expense account, you say this travel allowance that it started back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| it's been there for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Did Dwight Kessel and Tommy Shumpert both have the expense account you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Yes, sir, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Did they also have a credit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I can't speak for the credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Well, I'm not an engineer, nor am I an accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| You know, I try to look back at this, step back and see what we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| some things what Phil has said and stuff that, you know, Paul has said in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| You know, in my opinion, commissioners, if somebody's guilty, somebody's guilty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| and that will be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| But also, Mr. Cosby, are you going to other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| You know, we keep going to one office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I am done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| In all fairness, and, you know, Mr. Pinkston says this, and I agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| we're to save taxpayer dollars all we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| But if we have found this much money in one office, my goodness, let's keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Let's look at everybody else's too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I think we owe it to the citizens of Knox County to look at every office out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| and see what all we can find, look at all the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And then, because I don't want to just keep addressing this, like everybody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| let's address it, address it now, and let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| And let's do it professionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| May I comment to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Commissioner Pinkston, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Like I say, I'm not an accountant, a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| I'm just a poor, broke-down used car salesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| But I checked the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I checked the schools, the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| I checked every office up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| These other offices do not have credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| They have procurement cards that are used for where they do business at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| only to buy their supplies and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| and then the supervisor has to sign off on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| In the mayor's office, when I got to it, they had an open-end credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| If they wanted to, they could take this card, go over to the airport, buy an airplane ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| fly to Hiawahia, eat lunch, and fly back at the taxpayer's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| These other departments do not have that kind of card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Now, let's clear it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| They had procurement cards that were used to buy supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| They were designated only to be used at certain places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| and the supervisors have to sign off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Those are two totally different cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| But in another office, you might find something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| It was shown to us that our judges get $4,900 for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Why are we paying judges to travel to the courthouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| I believe a lot of that's controlled by the state, though, I believe, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| But still, you know, at every office we might find a different avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| We may have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Mr. Smith, could I point out one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Under the PCAR program that you have, you can block air travel, hotels, restaurants, car rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:19| drug stores, liquor stores, and financial cash advances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| You can do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| And I would suggest you do it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| That's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Oh, no, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| John, you've got to be kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| From this point on, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Oh, from this point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| We're not talking about from this point on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| We're talking about for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Good gracious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| A showboat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| What did you just say to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| Unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I have looked over Mr. Cosby's report, and I'm really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| And, Mayor, I want this fighting between commission and your office to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| It may have been fun at one time, but it's not fun anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| It's just gone on so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| But when issues like this come up, I'm really concerned about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| and I want to frame that with the conflicts of interest with Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:29| It's very clear that if you're in a position to award grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| and you award grants to nonprofits that are led by family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| that that's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| And at the very least, that should have been disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| And actually what should have happened was someone else should have handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| the request for grants so that a sister isn't handling a grant request for a sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| And it's like it's so obvious to me that there's a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| And I'm not saying that Cynthia's a bad person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| and I'm not saying that she hasn't been an asset to Knox County because she certainly has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| What I'm saying is that there's conflicts of interest that makes it very difficult for her to do her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| And it's almost like, based on your responses, that the end justifies the means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| that it doesn't matter if there's a conflict of interest as long as the final product is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| And now here this gentleman's brought out these financial issues to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| I mean, are you really saying that the end justifies the means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| or are you going to handle this gentleman's concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| In my mind, I think we've already handled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| I appreciate his suggestions that he's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| He's put a lot of effort into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| I think he's tried to work with our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| and if he wants to do anything else going forward, we'll continue to work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| I didn't say that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:06| I think I just made a comment about the importance of us working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| And you've been a great example of that, and I want to compliment you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| It started out a little rugged, but you've made a point to come by and visit with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| and try and work in the best interest of the community, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| I just told him, I appreciate what he's done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| And we're going to address things in our new disclosure forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| It requires that line to be on there if you've got any conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| And I'm hopeful that will address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| I mean, I would have brought most of the charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| In fact, I can't think of any that I would not have voted for the grant money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Had it been disclosed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Had she said, you know, my sister runs this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| and I'm going to leave this to you guys to decide whether you want to fund it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| It's just when I find out after the fact that there was a conflict, that has me really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| And I understand that we're fixing things going forward on the P cards and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| but are we going to go back and find the places where taxpayer money was misused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| and get that money back for the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I think we're already doing that, but we're going to keep working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| But, again, thank you for how you've reached out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Ms. Finch did disclose to us what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| We went and toured the programs that she's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| We could have done a better job disclosing with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| and there have been other examples that have listed as well, so it's not just her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| There have been other people that have had conflicts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| And this town really isn't that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| There are conflicts of interest that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| People know people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I just feel like I would have felt better had it been disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| I think Commissioner Trammell had his light on before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| We've been going on for a while here, and we do have other items on the agenda that we do need to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| Mr. Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I chair the procurement subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| and I would like to know if I were to hold a workshop, if you could attend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| and come to us and have Hugh and John and the members of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:31| and maybe we could come together and review some of our policies on the P cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:40| and if you could make suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| And, of course, this is going to be open to all of Knox County and the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| so that they can come forward and we can hear these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| I want to work with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I want to work with citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| And I want to work with the rest of the commission to make sure that as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| we're all on the same page of where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| And I'll be getting with Mr. Chairman, I'll get with you, and I'll get with Jolie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:14| and see if we can't set up a time here in the next few weeks, maybe sometime in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| that we can try to move forward on this issue because I don't see where we're getting anywhere today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| other than airing out a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| So I'd like to do something a little more proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| And if you'd like to give me a call sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| and then we'll see if we can't put together a workshop meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| and see if we can't come forward and bring something to commission that everybody can agree upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Mr. Cosby, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I want to apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| But thank you very much for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| As a concerned citizen, I wish we had more citizens like you out there that cared enough about Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| to step up and, you know, put their money where their mouth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| But, you know, this won't be the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I mean, to me there's obvious charter violations, and we're going to have to do this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| And there are going to be uncomfortable questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| And I want to commend the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| and the mayor for the way we've handled this right here in an adult mature manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| I'm just asking the chair, now, where are we to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Does this not all hinge on Richard Wall's report and the comptroller's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| I mean, that's what we're waiting on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| And so I think this airing out has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| It's probably been fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| It's certainly given a lot of people an opportunity to speak, share their hard issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| But I also think it's time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Mr. Mayor, could we ask you to hold a couple of questions or you rather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| If you'll come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Just so people know in Knox County at home watching commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| And thank you for coming down today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| The purchasing cards, could you tell me just because I don't know if any of us know exactly how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| But the question I want to get to is there's somebody that probably looks over these purchasing cards on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| to see if there's any inappropriate charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| Maybe that's a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Yeah, there's, in the last year and a half, there's a piece of software in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| It's a card manager from SunTrust Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| And it allows us to see unusual activity with the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| And when we see that activity through e-mails, we contact the department heads and the card user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| And has your department, I think your department is one of them that has had awards given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| We've won three best practices award for a small purchase program, which is the P-card program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| So winning awards like that and then we come up in a situation the way we are today, is there a glitch in the software?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| And I'll say it doesn't catch everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| It depends on how a merchant is set up, whether we get that notification or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| A Kroger is different than a Regus, which is different than a Walmart, which is different from a Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| Again, like I said, there's three levels of reporting in Visa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| And depending on what level that merchant reports at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| depends on whether we get a notification of that unusual activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| And if you get that, then you say you contact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Make a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| There are three people in my office that look at that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| And had you ever contacted the executive branch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| Personally, I have twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I can't speak for the other two individuals in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| And it wasn't the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| It was I had contacted Ms. Finch and Mr. Werner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| And not to put you on the spot, and if you don't want to answer, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| You say twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Is there other people that may have contacted these individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Because it looks like they could have been an ongoing, unusual charge popping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| Mr. Fisher, I couldn't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| I'd hate to say anything until I had them in a room where I could ask them that question myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| I appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| I appreciate the program because I think it is a good program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| and I think it's beneficial to all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I know with Parks and Rec, some of the guys would like to get theirs back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| Yes, there's several that would like to have them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| We've got Lisa Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:37| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| My name is Lisa Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I live on 3301 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| I am employed by the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| I work with the immigrant community here in Knox County and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2753)|
| 0:46:03| I just want to speak on behalf of the community for Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| You've read everything that's been in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Well, actually, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| I don't like what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| I don't like what I'm reading, so I'd rather not read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| I do want to say that because of Cynthia Finch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| the immigrant community has had some changes here in Knox County, and we're very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2786)|
| 0:46:37| The communities didn't have any kind of recognition or a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| And with the pastors, I agree, because she's been in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| Now, more communities have had recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| and have had some kind of success with nonprofit organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| being able to help the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| We're talking about communities who are not, I'm not sure what kind of word to use here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:09| but who live in areas that need financial help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| And that's the best way I'm going to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| And because of Cynthia Finch, nonprofit organizations have been able, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| I'm not saying that she's, you know, whatever the accusations are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| but she's looked at grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| My organization that is based in Nashville is a statewide organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| and it has several base organizations that are members of the coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| that are immigrants and refugee communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| And because of that, I am aware of who they're asking for monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| For instance, Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Centro Hispano was looking for grants, and yet they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| Centro Hispano is an organization out to help the Latino community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| Because of Centro Hispano Latino Task Force and Alianza, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| there were several issues that came up because of the Knox Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| that had to be, changes had to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| And we called out to Cynthia, and we had meetings and meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| and we did all the paperwork that we had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| And it was done, and it was a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| As Mayor Ragsdale said, they have had successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| So, yes, you know, I'm here to speak because she has had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| and the county mayor has had successes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| But let's not forget that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| I'm just very grateful that other communities are getting recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| and because of Ms. Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Ezra Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| I am Ezra Mays, 5809 Holston Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| I'm also the president of the NAACP here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| I am not here to try to minimize what is taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| for we understand that numbers are an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| But I am a little frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| We have become a little frustrated here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| We are extremely divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| and our county cannot be any greater than its leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| We don't know what is taking place in terms of county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| in terms of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| We don't know what the struggle is, what the power struggle is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| But we are extremely frustrated because when we opened the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| and you've heard this over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| all we hear is the negative side of what is going on in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| The news and the media has taken what has been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| and they'll take it, they'll twist it, they'll turn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| We're frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| It is our desire, it is our prayer that county commissioner, that the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| if you all can get behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I think it was a wonderful move on the mayor on this afternoon to say that he's sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| for whatever mishaps that have taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| or if he's done something that has offended you, he has apologized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| I believe that is extremely imperative that you all get behind closed doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| kiss, make up, whatever it takes, so that we can move on here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| We're so focused on what's going on in the county building that we're losing focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| of what's going on outside of the county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| And I believe that, and I hope that others will concur with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| that we're just ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| We're tired of the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| We're tired of the struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| We understand that things have to be done decently and in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| Again, we're not minimizing what is taking place in the county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| We're not minimizing what is taking place with the finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| But we in the county, we're just ready to move on and get a new start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| so that we will not be a laughing stock of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:29| I just wanted to comment, appreciate everything you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| except for the press that's present, we are not going anywhere behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| When I say get behind closed doors, I simply mean whatever it takes to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:46| and to make this thing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| It is our prayer that when we come back and this issue is brought before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| we can have some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| We've talked, again, about Ms. Finch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| and it is easy for us, you all, to lift up the negative side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| I was so happy to hear the young lady that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Ms. Finch has done a lot of positive things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| and I believe everybody here knows and understands that Ms. Finch has put all her heart into what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| It is easy for us to lift up the negative side of what everybody is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| but reality is there are some positive things that have taken place here in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| in our county, and if we can let the positive shine like we do the negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| maybe we can be a better community, a better county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| And it is my desire, you all, it is our prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| People have asked the NAACP, what are you all going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| This is not our fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| This is not our struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| This is not in our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| But we do desire to see our county, our community, to move on in full force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| and to be a healthy county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And it is our prayer that when we come together next time in a setting such as this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| it is our prayer that we have come to some resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| or that the county commissioners and the mayor have gotten together in public, go to lunch, stag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| It is our desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| It is our desire that you get together and come to some type of resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| and we can end the power struggle that is taking place here in the county of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| We have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| I think Ronnie Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| No, it was Jim Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Is there a Ronnie Golden in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| Thanks for paying attention, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| For the longest time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| This is a report on Midway Park and what we've looked at in regard to wastewater treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:49| We want to go, in the interest of time, fairly fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| This is only an information report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| After this, we're going to do more on numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| But more importantly, we're going to spend some time in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| And we have one meeting September the 13th at Lyons Creek Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:13| and we will be getting out a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| What we've done is we've looked at the options to serve East Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| We've always thought that while we were going through early site evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| that we would pump sewage to Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| It has the capacity to continue it, but it's about a ten-mile track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| And if you go ahead and click to the next one, the blue line is going to Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| It's about a ten-mile track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| And because of the new upgrades in the pumping station and the new part of the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| it's about a $14 million expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| The green line is going to East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| It's $13 million, and the track is 6.2 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| The price on it is that East Bridge would have to be greatly expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| and there's some question as to whether we could get it permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| The red line is the line going to Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:23| That brings in a lot of different political issues, crossing boundaries and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| but we thought we'd look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| The cost is $10 million on ten miles, and so it really doesn't look like a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| Then we looked at putting a treatment plant on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| And I started out looking at this thing as though it would be not appropriate for an industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| or a business park, but the more we've spent time looking at it, I think it's a very real solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| And it's about a $4 million fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| The problem with Loves Creek, East Bridge, Sevier County, and the site on the park is that it can only handle our wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:10| In other words, if any area around or in southeast Knox County wants sewer service, it's not going to get it by this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:21| One of the things that so what we've thought is prudent is for to ask you, eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:31| if you want us to take the $4 million that we would put in the on-site treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| and provide it to KUB for a water treatment plant that would service that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:44| It would require KUB to go and to go through the permitting process, which is about a two-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:56| I'm not sure that there's going to be another slug of cash that could be that type of pre-funder for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| It is a public policy question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Both work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| The on-site treatment plant is very doable, and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| And we have slides that can go through, if you want us to, what an on-site treatment plant looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| Or we will come back any time you want us to, which I'm figuring that's your default position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| But both work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| We're going to go have some public hearings, some discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| and come back to you with a whole lot of information on what people think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| and stuff for you to make a knowledgeable decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| And I'm sure you'll be hearing information yourself from people as we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| This was purely an advisory report, but I'll be happy to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:54| Does anybody have any questions for Mr. Edwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| Hello, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| What is the cost to go to East Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| What's the advantage of going to East Bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| The advantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| I mean, does it serve East Bridge as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| We have a treatment plant at East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| It takes care of the treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| So if we were to pump to East Bridge, and all of these are largely pumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| There's some gravity, but all of them have pumping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| We would have to expand the plant at East Bridge, and that goes through a permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| And that one we're not so sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| But the thing is, we don't know what we're picking up an advantage on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| So we expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| We're really not serving any other area if you're going to permit one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| We would much rather spend $4 million and put it on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| The three pumping makes very little sense to us once we identify the on-site solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| Our treatment plant that served the southeast corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| that's something you guys need to come to wrestle with and advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Or, more importantly, advise KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Well, you know that I'm going to be faced with the SINCO questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| What does on-site wastewater and the SINCOs that's there that you're aware of, is that a safer alternative than pumping it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:31| They are both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| There is not a solution that we're looking at that would be threatened by presence of SINCO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| or any other geological issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| They both have the exact same value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| I guess what I'm asking, if you put something on-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| is there a greater danger of the water and the waste getting into the French Frog River versus pumping it back to Love's Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| Now I'm really getting into something, but when you're treating that amount of water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3604)|
| 1:00:13| it is if you have something that gets in it like pharmaceuticals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| it is going to be better if it is diluted over a larger volume that a modern treatment plant would have going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:29| That being said, these on-site treatment plants are around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| They're not at one time there was the design created a tremendous amount of odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| These have zero odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| They're underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| If you look at them, they look like a soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| So, I mean, it's a whole different deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| But there are advantages in having a modern sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| Somebody, as I understand it, and I'm getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| if somebody was to dump a whole lot of antibiotics into the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| then it's easier to have that diluted over a municipal plant than it is a treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| So where does it go after it goes to Love's Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Is it just treated there and released on the Holston River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| If it goes to Love's Creek, it's released in, I think, Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| The advantage of that is that we don't pollute upstream and down back towards the French Prom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| If there's an advantage, if you can look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| No, I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:45| The area has the potential to develop with modern sewer at a greater level than it does without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:56| The affluent that would go into the river is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| and what KUB is talking about doing is a tertiary treatment plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| which is a step beyond what they have in the other plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| It's not contaminated, but, you know, that's where a lot of debate is going to happen, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| Is it similar to the one down here on Neyland Drive then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| What would go in place there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| No, it would be a more, it would be another level of treatment that is called tertiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| Which would be above the level down here on Neyland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| One of the things that if KUB was to pursue the permitting, they would have to put on proof to TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:48| and the public would have ample opportunity not only during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| but at that process to assure that TDEC would have total assurance that what was built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3773)|
| 1:03:01| and served met all the EPA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| If the goal was to open up the area, can you do it by pumping versus the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| Gravity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Every time you go up a hill, you've got to pump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Every time you change the size of the line, you change the size of the pump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Well, I mean, it adds the cost that most of, a whole lot of what we have today and not in this whole east end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| is going to, the cost of going to Love's Creek is a ton of pumps because they're either new pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:40| or existing pumps that have to be upgraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| I guess I'll wait and hear you a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| I just wanted to say for what it's worth, the option that I'm most interested in is one that opens sewer up to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:59| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| I'm mildly committed to the, well, I should say a bit more than mildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| I'm fairly committed to the industrial project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| but I'm extremely committed to opening up utilities to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| So whichever option is going to facilitate that is the one I'm going to be most in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Commissioner Frank Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| The question here, Mike, is what's the time frame for when we need to make a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| And if it's fairly soon, I think that you probably need to get with our chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| and with the county mayor and facilitate so we can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| and get more extensive time to review this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| and have a hearing so that we can facilitate moving forward on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| So, you know, it would be great if I could bring you something in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| We really have not had any public discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| We're going to spend time in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| And we need to have that before we really start, before you all can make a knowledgeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| It is really a philosophical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| They both work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| Mike, there was some talk earlier on about maybe coming down the interstate with the sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| and tying in Strawberry Plains back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Is that still an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| The blue is the route that they, that the engineers, is the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| And it's got a lot to do with the topo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And going down the interstate is something that they just don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| But that would open the property up down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| Come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| I'm Ed Medford with KEB 4508 Hubble Lane 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| All the options that are listed up on the map essentially just serve the business park alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| because they are forced mains as opposed to gravity mains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| And so the pipes, more or less, that are demonstrated up there, displayed on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| are set up to carry the flows from the business park to the different treatment facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| whether it be at East Bridge, if we can get that permitted to handle the additional flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| or out at Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| So it's the route going down the interstate as opposed to going to Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| The route, as far as does follow the topology, much better from the business park to Loves Creek to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| So you're saying, Ed, that nobody could tie on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Whatever we do would not provide sewer to different parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| What would it cost to provide the sewer to different parts of the county since you're running that up there to Midway Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| Would it not be advantageous to the rest of the community to be able to do something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| And what is an additional cost for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| Based on some preliminary studies that we've looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| it's roughly about the same amount of cost to put a new treatment plant in that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| that would open up the southeast Knox part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| So the new treatment plant facility would end up, as Commissioner Lambert indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| providing more access to sewer in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| We believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| You also have capacity issues that you will get into at Loves Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| if you were to try to pump everybody along the blue line at Loves Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| So it becomes more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| It's already $14 million to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Do we have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Mr. Edwards, to you and your staff, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| You all do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| If I could indulge to speak on that very issue about where the business park is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and the growth in that particular part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| I would like to take about three minutes to speak to that, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| If you'll state your name and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| It's Victor Jernigan, 108 Stecoya, S-T-E-K-O-I-A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| Stecoya Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:29| First, as a disclaimer, I own property at the corner of Midway and Thorn Grove Pikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| That's the first disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| The second disclaimer is that I'm in the process of trying to acquire more property in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| And the reason is that this east Knoxville area, just as northeast Knoxville was positioned for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| as soon as sewer became available in the Millartown, Murphy Road, Washington Pike, Tazewell Pike area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| the east Knoxville area is really set to have exponential growth if it has sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| It's within five miles of the largest retail development, including a Bass Pro Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| The 407 exit is larger than it will be when it's finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| and all the land is assembled up there will be larger than Turkey Creek is in west Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| The traffic generation, if you pick either end of Turkey Creek and took a five-mile arc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| from the end of either side of that at Lovell Road or Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| you get an idea of the kind of development that can occur at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| The interstate exit, the business park, I believe, will be a phenomenal success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| simply because there's so much industrial growth going on in upper east Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| And I've invited several commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| I have aerials of all of north Knoxville and I invite any of the commissioners that would like to come by to my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| to see how the area actually works with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| But there are Ruggles Ferry Road, the growth, there's million-dollar houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| and $300,000 houses being built along Ruggles Ferry Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| and several of those larger farms are now coming up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| The most expensive subdivision in Knoxville, Tralee, is out on East End Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| The opportunity to be two miles or three miles from, if you are a mile and a half off of the Midway Road exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| you are still within seven miles of a super Walmart and all the shopping that's going to be at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| The need for housing for people in Sevier County who want to be in the Knox County school systems will be enormous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| As this moves through the public hearing, I am confident that the people who live in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| are not going to want sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| They've resisted sewer for an exceptional period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| And I can't speak to the fact of whether there should be an on-site planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| whether there should be a sewer treatment facility that KUB is going to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| I will say that if the area is sewered, it will dramatically change the housing picture in all of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:56| because you will open this area up to the thousands of people who are going to work at the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| are going to want to live in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| And they have to have sewer if they're going to live close to where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| The business park is going to have somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| They're going to want to live close to where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| They have to have sewer to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Pumping to wherever they pump it to will not be able to allow the housing to be in that immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| Separate from that, we have the opportunity to attract business and retail opportunities at the interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| on property that's not owned by the Knox County Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| again, giving us enormous opportunities to offset the cost of whatever the KUB system might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| So I just wanted to touch base on that because I'm sure there's going to be an extremely controversial issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| as it comes forward with the public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Okay, we've got a couple of lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Yeah, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| You were comparing this area to Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| and I just wanted to say that the sales tax alone that is generated from Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| has made a significant difference to both Knox County and to a greater degree Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| I guess what I'm saying is I would love to have another Turkey Creek bringing in money to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4326)|
| 1:12:15| that would keep us from having a tax increase for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Mr. Chairman, I just want to compliment Victor on his dapper look today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| You look very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Also, Mr. Chairman, before we get into zonings, the folks in the schools are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| and I know that they've been very patient about the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| They want to know if they have any money to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| So I don't think it will take a long time if we could give them the courtesy maybe of hearing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:49| Or was it already on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Maybe I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| I just noticed the schools were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| and I was just wondering why they've sat here for four hours unless they just want to see us in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| It's because they're wildly interested in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:07| I thought we approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:18| We approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| It's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:29| My apologies, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Apparently it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I just noticed the school folks were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| and I thought maybe there was a reason why they were hanging out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| At this time we'll start the zonings, and we'll come back and finish up our agenda after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:46| Could I make a motion, if someone would second it, that we do the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| and then we come back tomorrow to finish the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| We do have the first downtown movie theater that has opened in decades with their grand opening tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| that all of us were invited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Is it at five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| It was at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Unless you're going to buy some insurance tomorrow, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| Just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| If it doesn't get a second, I won't get my feelings hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| But we have been invited to a significant event, and I'd like to attend that if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| We'll dismiss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| What else do we have on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Let's start the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| MPC people here ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Mr. Donaldson, we appreciate you patiently waiting on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| We apologize to the people who have zoning requests out there and a little bit behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| Okay, clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| First item, we're on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| This is a request of Metropolitan Planning Commission for a street name change from unnamed easement to Harold Duncan Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| The street's located between Copper Ridge Road and Dead End in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| I see MPCs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Seeing no opposition, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Second for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4508)|

| 1:15:19| The next two are requests of the Fuller Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| The first is for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from A Agricultural and RR Rural Residential to LDR Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| The second is for rezoning from A Agriculture to PR Plan Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| They're both located on the southeast side of Hickory Creek Road, southeast of West Gallaher Ferry Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Arthur Seymour, Jr. here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| If we could pass that for 60 days, we will then make a decision which way we go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| We're asking for a 60-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4551)|

| 1:15:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4558)|

| 1:16:00| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Request of Land View Development LLC for rezoning from A Agricultural to CN Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| The property is located on the north side of Beaver Ridge Road, east side of Wyndham Point Lane in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| We've got some people over here to the left behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| I can't see them in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| MPC, you want to give us a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| This is a 1.3-acre tract on the north side of Beaver Ridge Road, east of Wyndham Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| Current zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| The requested zoning was neighborhood commercial CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Currently undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| The proposed uses would be consistent with those that are in the neighborhood commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:58| MPC recommended approval of CN, the neighborhood commercial, with conditions that have been outlined in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:09| limiting access to Beaver Ridge Road, providing landscape buffer along the northern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| and western property lines, and completing the road improvements at Beaver Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| and Oak Ridge Highway at that intersection that were discussed at the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| Is that all you've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Applicant or the opposition, you only have five minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| Who wants to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:48| I always hate to yield my first opportunity, but I believe I'll let the opponents go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| The opposition, if you'll state your name and address of the record, however many is going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| Now you have up to five minutes, and then you have three minutes rebuttal after Mr. King gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| So you want to spread your time out if you have a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| I spoke first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Would I get five minutes and three minutes for rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| Of course you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| My name is Tim Humphreys, 6957 Wyndham Point Lane, Lawson, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| I'm one of the members of the Wyndham Point Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| and I'd like to request that this item be removed from the agenda today due to some violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| that we believe have occurred with the Open Meetings Act with my district commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| And we also want to point out that she has indicated to us that she has a personal friendship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| longstanding friendship with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| and we believe that places her in a serious conflict of interest on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Based on this information, I don't believe that my neighborhood's opposition to this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| will receive fair and unbiased consideration at this forum today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| If this item cannot be removed from discussion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| I would ask at least, Mr. Commissioner, that Ms. Kaye would be recused from discussing this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| before voting on this agenda due to these items that I have outlined, and I can go into detail if we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| She's got her line on, so Commissioner Kaye, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| I would like to make everyone aware that over the weekend I went to the property, and while I was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:33| I guess all of the commissioners here actually received a fax or an e-mail inviting us out to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| to view the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| While I was there, Commissioner Strickland came, and we had a map that was faxed to us that we were looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| and we were measuring the lot line from the curb and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| We were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| We were discussing where the building would be laid out, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| I believe that's what he is referring to as our sunshine violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| but I would like to point out in the definition of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| it says a meeting does not include any on-site inspection of any project or program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| and I believe that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Commissioner Kaye, well, that is only one of the instances that I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| There was a meeting that occurred on April the 12th between Carnes Business Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4821)|
| 1:20:28| Tennessee Department of Transportation, Knox County Engineering, and West Utah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| Would you speak a little closer, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| There was a meeting that occurred on April the 12th at the Carnes Business Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| that indicated the developer, the Carnes Business Association, Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:47| the Tennessee Department of Transportation, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| were at this meeting to discuss this particular road realignment and rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| and my neighborhood was not given an opportunity to be present at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| Since this particular road rework project has been adjoined to this rezoning request for this particular parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| which I will indicate here momentarily to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| that is another reason why we request that this item be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| because we believe that we have not had a fair opportunity to defend ourselves in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| before the items that were placed together with this rezoning request were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4881)|
| 1:21:28| Okay. I doubt the item is going to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| I believe that you're talking about the Carnes Business Association meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| which a notice about that meeting is posted on the Carnes Business Association sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| directly in front of the subdivision that you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| But it also indicates that this has to be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| And that meeting was also sunshine, so I believe everyone had the opportunity to be at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| But isn't it also my interpretation that that has to be posted in the Knox News Sentinel as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| That's not a complete notification to a community that a meeting of that nature is going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| But, again, you started at 6-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| At 6-14, you've got two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| I've got some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Commissioners, Vice Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| Whatever Mr. Humphrey is saying, I gave him the opportunity to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| and to correct something that he's sent out to the News Sentinel, all the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| TV stations about Commissioner Kaywood and myself breaking the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| The reason I was out at their property is because Mr. Humphrey invited me to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| Not Sharon Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Mr. Humphrey, Mr. Lizard, and Frank Shanklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| And I told them that I would come out and look at the property and see what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| So I gave him a chance to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| He said out in the hallway he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| He didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| So, yes, you lied on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| I'm not sure where John Owens is at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| but I think this is a matter that he needs to address as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| or not he feels like this is something that we should postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| or if we can continue until he's back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| I'm going to suggest we put this down in a meeting until his return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| Is that a motion for a five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| Well, no, just that we move on to another item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| and we'll revisit, we'll come back to this when the law director is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| I spoke with the law director's office this morning, and that's what they gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| And I would feel more comfortable if he were here to make sure that as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| that we do have our legal advice at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| If that's okay with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| Well, we could move on to the next item and come back to this upon his return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| If you all just have a seat, we'll get back to you in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| We've got one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| They've probably got two minutes because we talked a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5068)|

| 1:26:21| Request of Robert Werdeman for rezoning from I Industrial to A Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| The property is located on the southwest side of Gray Hendricks Road, southeast of Rutledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| Pike, in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5194)|

| 1:26:49| Seconded by Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5211)|

| 1:26:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| It's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| Let's go back to the one that we had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Clerk, if you'll go back to the bottom of page 21, land view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Gentlemen, the law director is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| If you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| I'll say we should give him his five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| If you want to, just start over and the law director can hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Mr. Law Director, what our previous discussion was about was this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| I had asked it to be removed due to what we believe were violations of the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| where governing bodies were put together to basically do a strategy session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| about how they could use this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| rezoning it for the purposes of a road realignment and traffic light in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| Commissioner Cawood has indicated that this meeting was posted on a bulletin board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| essentially on a highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| but that it was not published in the Knox News Sentinel as other public meetings are supposed to be indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Also, we believe that she has a conflict of interest in this particular applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| because she has indicated to us that she has a longstanding friendship with the applicant in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| And we believe that that can cause undue influence in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5297)|
| 1:28:24| So I would ask that at least if this item cannot be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| that at least Commissioner Cawood be recused from any discussion or voting on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| Is that a valid request that I can present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| You can make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| Are you the person that sent the e-mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| I got your e-mail and I read part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I didn't have a chance to read it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:56| If there's an allegation that the Sunshine Law has been violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| and certainly you're making that allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| then at the meeting itself the alleged violation can be cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| The law allows that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And in this instance, whoever it is that you have alleged violated the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| what I would recommend to the county commissioners that were involved in that is a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| and complete disclosure of what went on, a discussion of what occurred, who was involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| and put it on the table for the rest of the commission to consider, along with this zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:40| Mr. Laudry, I don't believe that would benefit the opposition's case if she is allowed to present that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| because I think that's going to be detrimental to our cause here because she's trying to conjoin a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| and realignment with a rezoning of a parcel inside of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| And I don't see what the benefit of that is, allowing her to discuss that and present that to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| I want that topic just not to be discussed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| I understand your statement and your view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| but what the law provides is that a legislative body such as this can cure any alleged violation at a meeting such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:21| by fully and completely discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| And, you know, the deliberation will occur here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| It will occur on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| And, you know, you're welcome to join in with that if you're in opposition, you know, to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| But what I would advise our legislative body is for openness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| and for them to reveal who was involved in the meeting, what discussions were had, and to put it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:54| So, you know, if that occurs, in my opinion, any alleged violation has been cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5454)|
| 1:31:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| If that's the best I'm going to get at this point, I will take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| That will not count against my time in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| I will be able to review any statements made to that effect where that item is disclosed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| It's going to be discussed tonight, I would hope, when your matter is taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| Mayor, are we taking up this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Yes, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| It will be discussed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Well, one thing I want to leave you with, and I'm going to turn my time over to some other individuals here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| but I just want to show you just so that everyone is clear what particular parcel that we are talking about at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:49| Sir, you're going to have to speak to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| 7503 Beaver Ridge Road is the particular parcel that is in question at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| It is not this parcel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| It has been indicated numerous times by Commissioner Cawood when she has brought individuals to show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5518)|
| 1:32:06| It's not this area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| It is actually this parcel right here, which abutes up to our neighborhood pool in our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| and is behind, as you will see in another picture, behind our neighborhood entrance sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| At this time, I want to go ahead and turn it over to Tim Lessard and let him speak additionally on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| Mr. Moore, I just ask that I'm sure you – oh, my name is Tim Lessard, 6949 Windham Point Lane, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| And, Commissioner, I know you're under the gun and this has gone very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| Our neighborhood is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| They've waited well over two hours to hear this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| and I think enforcing the five-minute rule here would be detrimental, I guess, to use Tim's word, for our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5575)|
| 1:33:04| I live in Windham Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| And let me give you a little history on this sector plan of this parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| In 2003, a developer applied to have our subdivision zone plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| At that same time, he submitted an application to have the sector plan of the parcel in question changed to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| The commercial portion of the application was rejected by county commission, but the plan residential went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:31| Houses started being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| And after the sector plan was changed, it was changed to PR slash C, plan residential commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| So it could be either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| And then houses began to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| We'll show you that this rezoning is a poor idea for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| Typically, let's just look at CN zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Typically, CN is commercial property allowed to be side-by-side with residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5633)|
| 1:34:00| And that commercial property would provide a benefit to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| The two zoning types would intermingle and coexist, and one would benefit the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| The applicant was clear at MPC that he intends to put a tile carpet cabinet showroom on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| This showroom does not really provide any added benefit to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| We've all picked our cabinets and tiles and things of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| We don't need that in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| We have great concern that because of this, once the developer has finished building homes in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| and people have picked their tiles and carpets and cabinets, this property will become vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| And if you've ever been down on Critch Highway, there is plenty of vacant commercial property within a half a mile of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:49| Second, let's dig into who benefits from this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| Winston Cox benefits from this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| He's the man that owns Land View Development, a developer of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| He benefits from this rezoning because he could sell this property at commercial rates versus agricultural rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| We all understand that commercial rates are much higher than agricultural rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| We feel Commissioner Cawood has intermingled this road realignment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| and this whole concept in with this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| So every time the rezoning request is mentioned, up comes the road, up comes the traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| And our neighborhood is not opposed to the road realignment nor to the traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| What we're opposed to is that it sounds, from what we see on the news and from what we hear in the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| or what we see in the news and hear in the news or read in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| that all the developer asks is that he can recoup his expenses for donating a nominal piece of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:45| and doing some road work. He wants to recoup his expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| And all he asks is that you rezone his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Well, I'll tell you what, Wyndham Point is all he asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| He's asking for the integrity of our neighborhood, and that is what we're fighting against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| One other thing, in the Knox News Sentinel last week, Commissioner Cawood was quoted saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| yes, there is a contract for the traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| TDOT has agreed that the intersection will meet their criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| We have all the paperwork completed and signed by all the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| So I dug in. I called TDOT. TDOT said they have seen an original map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| They reviewed it, and they sent back three parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| If TDOT sees these three things, submit a final map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| then we'll send it into state for approval and permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| And when I talked with TDOT, they said only the initial concept has been seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:34| They have not seen a final documentation of how they're going to do the road reworks and the storage lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| Let me interrupt you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| You're five minutes up, so you won't have three minutes rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| but it's going to be Mr. King's time to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I just want to ask you, sir, and I feel for your neighborhood, and I'm your county commissioner also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| but this red light is vital for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| We're going to discuss the red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Well, what I'm saying is, sir, how do you propose that we do the red light without the property that will be donated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:11| and the property won't be donated without this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| How do you propose that we do the red light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| No, that's not my bailiwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Well, no, I'm just asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| I'm not a transportation group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| I'm asking you, how do you propose that we get the property for the red light without doing this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| You're asking me not to do this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| I'm asking you for an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| First of all, to address the question about the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| is the property does not have to be rezoned commercial in order for there to be a road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| That is not a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| I've discussed that with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| The Department of Engineering has told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| The owner of the property will not donate the property to the county or the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| He will not donate the property to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| How do you propose we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| And who says we need to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| I've been by there many times, and somebody is going to get killed if we don't put a red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:07| And seeing as how your only fire protection in the area is dependent upon an intersection that desperately needs a red light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:18| if that red light is not there, sir, someone is going to die and probably several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| I have risked my life many times pulling out from that intersection, and I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| I feel for your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| But what I want to know is how do you propose that we do this without doing this rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| I want you to give me another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| How much time do I have to give you another option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| Because I don't feel like we have another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| If I can interrupt you for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| We've got to keep some civil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| One person talking at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| The rest of us are not going to understand anything anyone says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| So right now, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Mr. King's going to get to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| He'll get five minutes, and then you'll have three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Plus, we'll give some, you know, somebody can yield some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| They tell me the developer gets four years to work this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Commissioner Cady, we get six months to promote it, and we get five minutes to defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| That is really a sad statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Mr. Chairman, I'm not with the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| I'm just a citizen that lives about five streets up on Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| I came here tonight under my own volition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| I have not had an FBI background check to see if I know Ms. Kaywood or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| But could I just share 90 seconds, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| If you'll just have a seat, we'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| Mr. King, the time is 6.32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:54| Chairman, members of the commission, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| Mr. Bev Coffey is here with some of his neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| A lot of them have already left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| I have representatives from Ingalls who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I know Mr. Coffey has gone throughout this neighborhood collecting names on a petition in support of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| which I believe he probably supplied to Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| And I want to say a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| And I want to take the liberty at the end of my time to respond to the suggestions first made about the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6025)|
| 1:40:35| Yes, the two subjects are to a degree commingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| That is rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| and curing a very dangerous intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| and improving it for the interest of all of the people who travel that particular set of roadways on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:54| But I'm not going to necessarily start out intertwining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| I want to deal with it first as a rezoning matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| Is this a good zoning classification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| Is this a good proposed utilization of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Look at the map in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| I believe you'll find when you look at that that Wyndham Point subdivision adjoins CA zoning on seven or eight of its lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:20| The creation of neighborhood commercial that adjoins one such lot is no substantial change in what already exists there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:30| The other lot that it adjoins has a swimming pool on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| That's the neighborhood swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| We have, I have never, no application has ever misidentified which piece of property or which lot it is we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:46| It's the same lot that in 2003 we proposed to rezone at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| at the time we were proposing to rezone the planned residential portion that is now Wyndham Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| And at that time we asked for neighborhood commercial and staff recommended neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6118)|
| 1:42:06| Now, it's said here today that it was turned down at county commission in 2003 when that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:14| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| I recall, and I've just got here today and tried to check it out, and I can't get it confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| My recollection was that we ended up requesting that it be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:29| because Commissioner then Mark Kaywood had an interest in pursuing the subject that they're now complaining about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:38| and that is improving this intersection, seeing if we and Ingalls would get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| and the two of us come up with a way that we would contribute sufficient right away to improve that side of the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:53| with the corresponding agreement on the part of the county to improve the other side of the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| square up that intersection, and ultimately be in a position to get a traffic block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| We spent four years working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| There were times that I thought it never was going to come to fruition, and I just sort of threw up my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| Commissioner Mark Kaywood wouldn't let it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| He kept pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| He said, this is the best thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| We need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| This is the way it needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| Don't wait and see what you've got left before you start talking about rezoning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| In April is when there was a meeting at Carnes, and we've had no telling how many meetings with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:40| with the county highway department, with Bruce's office, and with other people who are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:48| The fire station out there wants to see this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| The county wants it done because of the baseball softball parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| They want it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| The county library up on Beaver Ridge is in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| It goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| We finally, in April, for the first time, after doing, I think, two traffic studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:06| and a number of other things for the state, finally had them to the point where they were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| okay, we've asked you to reengineer this twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| You've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| We've looked at what the county says they'll do on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| They've done the engineering on that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| We've gone back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| We've reviewed the traffic studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| You build it the way you got it designed, and we will permit a traffic light to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| And everybody said, thank goodness, we're finally there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| And at that meeting, there was no discussion of any rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| There was no discussion of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Commissioner Kaywood was the only commission member there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| There were a lot of other people there who were very interested in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| But she was the only commission member there, and there was no discussion of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| When we left that meeting, I believe I probably did make contact with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| and tell her now that we know where we are, now that we know what property we're going to be giving away, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| and where it's going to be located, we're going to be filing a rezoning petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| asking that it be rezoned neighborhood commercial, just like we did in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| Now, we used, and perhaps Mr. Cox used an example, as they so flippantly refer to it as tile, carpet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:25| and cabinets in an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| That's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| That's an example of why it's neighborhood commercial as opposed to just pure office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| I'll give you a better example of why the request is for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| Use, for an example, Clancy Optical Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| That's a perfectly good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| You can't use it in an office, but you can in neighborhood commercial because he's selling something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| And he's not doing a lot of selling, not a lot of retail, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| That is the kind of operation that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| What you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Mr. King, can I interrupt you for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| What you have up there is what it looks like, what the building looks like and where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| We would ask that you approve our rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| This is a suggestion to the people who live in the neighborhood there that in their rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:25| that they address the rezoning issue of why this property should not be rezoned for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:35| I would like to hear those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| I've heard from at least one of the citizens call me and outline that person's reasons, and I listened for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:47| We're hearing a lot of other arguments, and I would just really like to hear their arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| why this property should not be rezoned for the neighborhood because we've already heard the other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6412)|
| 1:47:00| So that's just a request to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Mr. King, I have a question of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| I was only in PC when we approved this, and I just assumed that it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| So when it came back to us again, I was very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| This came from you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| They talked about the integrity of the neighborhood and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| I see brick on two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Is this an all-brick structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| It is an all-brick structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| It has no doors opening from the rear, which will be the portion, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| adjoining the swimming pool and the one lot, which lot on that is lot number 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| which happens to be owned by my client and is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| And the houses in the subdivision pretty much have a brick front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| I think most of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| There may be some brick and trim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| But not brick all the way around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| I did not see the difference in the integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| I think that would, in my opinion, is keeping integrity up by you doing all brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| The opposition's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| Who wants to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| Well, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| Let's get this guy right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| Give him just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| Commissioner, my name is Jeff Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| I reside at 3324 Franklin Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| I don't have the benefit of your packet, but Franklin Creek Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| as you veer to the right going west off Oak Ridge Highway onto Beaver Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| would be five streets and then on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| And I've lived there for about four years with my wife and now four children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| And four years ago I came down here in opposition to the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| which led to the development to the homes of these honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| hardworking citizens who stand before you or sit before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| And the reason I was in opposition was because I wanted a traffic light there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| to protect my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| That wasn't forthcoming, so I assumed the best way to protect my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| my kids, was to reduce the number of people using that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| as selfish as that would have seemed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| And I'll apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Now they have beautiful homes and they are a definite asset to our entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| But my wife and four kids, and if you'll pardon the 1980s reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| play human frogger at that intersection, today six times in our van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| I've played it three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| And if she sends me to Ingalls for Milk tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| I'll play it a total of 11 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| And that's 11 times too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Now, to me, if you have a gentleman that has property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| and wants to donate it to the county, you can't get much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| I don't know if Commissioner Pinkston had good deals like that going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| selling cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| If you have somebody who wants to give something to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| in exchange for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Article 1.30 of the Zoning Ordinance of Knox County states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| in order to provide for the public health, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| morals and general welfare, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| there is hereby adopted and established an official zoning plan for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| So when the folks that sat down and wrote this, perhaps some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| perhaps others you know, sat down and wrote the Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| right in the preamble, I'll call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| the issues they were most concerned about and which I would hope would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| the filter through which you would filter the information you're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| tonight would be the public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| So that's why I'm here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| so that my kids and my wife would enjoy health and safety for years to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| We love that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| When I'm trying to get across that intersection at 6 to get them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| baseball or up to the Riverton Club to get their helmets to go play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| football or over to Grace to go to Scouts or up to the pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| I don't want to have to worry that I've made a wrong decision every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| I go through a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| I don't have to worry about that downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| I don't have to worry as I leave those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| looking at the nine counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| one vision as I spoke out of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| there's a four-lane road going to Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Forget the interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Asheville, Maynardville Highway, just go around the clock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| Clinton Highway down to, you skip Oak Ridge Highway and you get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| Middlebrook and Kingston Pike and then Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| All those main spokes have a four-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Ours doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| So in effect, you're putting a Band-Aid on a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| but I ask that you put it on sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| This issue of this preamble and the principles that our forefathers put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| for instance, in our U.S. Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| in order to form a perfect union, that was their concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| And you see that concern throughout the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| It's the same in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| The primary concern, as our founding fathers here or forefathers here laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| out, would be the public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| And I ask that you zealously guard the health and safety of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Mr. Chairman, I suggest that was about a four-minute speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| at least in favor of the proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| So I think the opposition is entitled to at least that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| And then at that point, we can probably wrap up and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| We were going to allow them some time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| So, sir, if you'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| I handed you a letter that was made available to us from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| And basically to kind of repeat what the applicant's lawyer said is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Mr. Kaywood indicated that this is totally inappropriate as it breaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| the residential barrier of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Can anyone on the commission name me another neighborhood that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| something like this inside of its front entry gates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| We're fixing to do it on Washington Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| I was going to say, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| plenty of them that are in your circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| And, again, I feel for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| And I feel like I'm doing what's in the best interest of you folks as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| well, because somebody's going to get killed pulling out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| But your neighborhood is mere tens of yards off of a major highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| Your neighborhood backs up against a shopping center that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| going to have, with the Ingalls Shopping Center there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| probably going to be stores coming along the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| When you bought there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| you knew that your neighborhood was niched in the middle of a heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| trafficked commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| And this rezoning is going to make your neighborhood safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| Now, if you lived on a small back road out in the middle of nowhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| your concerns may be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| But considering you've got CA right behind you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| and now I find out that the person who owns lot number 80 is not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| protesting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| the one that this backs up to is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| That house is not sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| It's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| Who owns number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| You own number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6825)|
| 1:53:46| Are you in favor of this or against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| Lot number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6831)|
| 1:53:59| One and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| Second house on the left, the one that will actually be across from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| I own the first house on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| That's lot number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| I mean, the folks that are butted right up against this aren't here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:16| This is Vermont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| I'm the only one that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Lot number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Who lives in the second house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| He just moved in Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| He is number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Well, for clarification, for clarification, if I may, lots one and two that show on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| I think have been combined to make his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| And it's actually numbered lot number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| Lots number one and two, this gentleman back here, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Lot number three sold and closed yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| And he doesn't have a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| He doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Hold it, hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| It is my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| I'm not going to listen to these people trying to shut me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| It's not your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| I know, but you'll have your time to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| But you'll get your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| But let me ask the audience just, you know, we understand your opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| But for us to be able to hear and to come up with a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| if you could just remain silent unless you're at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| and we can get through this a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| So I'm still going to get you three minutes, so continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| To rebut the lawyer's comment earlier about Ingalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| we all knew Ingalls was there when we bought our homes because we could see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| It was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| It was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| There wasn't anything on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| This building wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Had we all known it was there, we wouldn't have bought homes in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| and he would still be trying to sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| So that's my response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Lastly, to speak to Commissioner Lambert's, what should we propose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| Here's a proposition about what we could possibly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| We could put in a three-way intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| put in a flashing yellow light to allow the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| and anyone else to be able to utilize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| and have a safer, you know, adjunction to Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| so it would have a 90-degree turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| and close the north entrance of Beaver Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| so that no traffic can be allowed on Oak Ridge Highway from that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| and make everyone turn right back onto Beaver Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| to go down to a safer intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| Bruce, is that even possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| Well, I certainly don't want to redesign the intersection here at a commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| but I can tell you this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| In regards to the passive control devices, such as flashing lights and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| our experience has been and continues to be that they're totally ineffective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| for dealing with traffic situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| When you see those little flashing lights they put at intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| not talking about a signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| we find those to be totally ineffective controlling traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| Now, Bruce, since these issues are inevitably tied together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| in your opinion, do you believe that this red light is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| Let me answer your question this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| Without the partnership of the county, the Ingalls, and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| this intersection does not rise to the level that we would be looking at it for a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| And with the signal comes intersection improvements, with the alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| That's got to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| Because of that partnership, it does rise to the level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| I've got intersections that are far worse that I'm going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| When we get around to this intersection, I could not tell you, but without this partnership, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| It's going to be postponed for a significant amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| I'd say several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Several years that folks will be risking their lives at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| Several years that the volunteer fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| which is the only fire protection in the area, is going to be slowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| In those several years, several people could die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| Okay, sir, you've got two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| What about putting in a yellow red light that could be controlled by the volunteer fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| that they could turn on demand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| The only intersections that I'm familiar with that you have essentially a fire department that can preempt it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:32| is an actual signalized intersection with an actual light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| The Tennessee Department of Transportation has made it clear that without the appropriate road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| i.e. lining up this intersection, making it more of a cross-type intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| that they will not approve the installation of the signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| Well, since there is no written agreement or contract between Winston-Cox Landview Development and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| how can anybody, any Knox County citizen be assured that this would occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| How can he not get rezoning, turn around and sell the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| and leave Knox County and its residents hanging high and dry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| I think we've got a few witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| I've got a good answer if you want to hear an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| If they really want to hear an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Do you want the question answered or do you want to ask it rhetorically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:26| I'll just wait then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| Let's hear the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| You're going to get all the time you need, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| John, let's go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Let's be professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| One of the conditions at MPC and one of the conditions of their approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| and one of the conditions that is attached to their recommendation is this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| doesn't get built until such time as the road has been redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| We don't get a building permit until, in fact, the road improvements have been done and completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| Am I right, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| In the caption, the last condition is completing road improvements at Beaver Ridge-Oakridge Highway prior to issuance of building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:16| That doesn't guarantee that a building is going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| That's what our argument is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| If this property is going to be sold and it's tied to a building permit, then he has nothing to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| He can sell the property and off he goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| And also, what do we guarantee that will this be tied to the property deed so that it would transfer to a seller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| if indeed this does occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Can someone answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| Most members of this body that have been here for a while have heard me say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| and some of you have been on other bodies and heard me say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| I don't like deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| I don't recommend deed restrictions to my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| I'm not going to do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| Winston Cox says what he's going to build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| I believe him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| I believe they're protected by virtue of what I have just suggested to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| And I believe that's tying it down enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| If you look at the neighborhood commercial, in order for anything to be built there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| it's got to come back again to have that other bite of the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| I don't know what else is required, but I'm going to tell you now in answer to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| I will not recommend to the client that he deed restrict it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| Do you want the gentleman to go behind you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| My name is Dean McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| I live in the first house on the left in Windham Point, 6905 Windham Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| Aside from all the hypothetical scenarios and rezoning politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| and all the specifics, I'm not familiar with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| But one thing I am familiar with, Winston Cox came to my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| and wanted to go over this with me and see kind of what my viewpoint of this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7317)|
| 2:02:03| so I have a good idea as to what's going on as far as what he's proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:08| We went out there together and stepped it off and measured it off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| and he showed me exactly where this proposed building is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| And then I came back, got my tape, and took a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| This building is going to be 35 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| The front corner of this building is going to be 35 yards from my front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| And also at the corner of the building where it conjoins with the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| like I said, I stand on my front door and 35 yards ahead of me is this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:37| That's the bottom line concern with me and I think with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| I don't want to be redundant and point out all the obvious things that have been talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| as far as proximity behind our neighborhood gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| I never would have dreamed I'd be down here trying to have to feel like I have to fight for my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| One would think that you see a residential neighborhood gates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| you would just think that indicates this is the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| and, oh, by the way, here's a commercial building, too, because it fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| and because they wanted a red light and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| We want a red light, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| Everyone does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| I think there's got to be another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| What about building houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| You can put a couple of homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| And, I mean, was it donate the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Donate it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| I mean, you can still build a couple of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| You may not make as much money as maybe you would with commercial, but donate the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| It can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| The problems with Commissioner Lithold asked earlier, what are the reasons we don't want it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| The reasons are, first of all, it's a commercial building in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| and with that comes potential for loitering, potential for uninvited guests or people in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7420)|
| 2:03:49| You don't know who's in and out of your neighborhood when you get a vacant parking lot like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| surrounded with shrubs, as they say it's going to be, shrubs and trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| and it's going to be witches, fine and dandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| With that comes skateboarder kids, nothing against skateboarder kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| but people that just don't belong in the neighborhood, and who knows what they're up to all hours of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| I mean, there's no one guarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| That's our number one concern is that we've got a piece of commercial property inside our neighborhood gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| If it were somewhere, you know, Ingalls, that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| That's not even a fair comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| Ingalls, everyone knew Ingalls was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| Seven properties back up to Ingalls, yeah, they knew it was there when they moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| I asked LandView six months ago when I came here, my wife and I transferred down here from Iowa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| and we looked at this property and we were interested in the property, excited to finally get our house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| everything we always wanted, a swimming pool, a nice neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| and then we get in there and we're in the house and I asked the realtor directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| what's going to happen with that land over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| And I expected him to say, well, they're going to put a couple more houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| He said, well, they can't build on that for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| They're just going to landscape it or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| They're not going to do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Okay, I mean, I believe people, I want to believe people are good natured enough to tell me the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| and I don't have to second guess them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| He told me nothing's going to happen to it, so I believe nothing's going to happen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| They'll green space it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| And this is what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| And now he's denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| You've had five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| That suits me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| You know, this body has in the past and I hope continues in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| to encourage public-private participation in problem solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| And I don't back up from anybody, and I don't back up one bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| or offer any apologies for what my client and the public instrumentalities have done in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| We have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to address problems of an entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:19| a larger community, if you will, than just this single adjoining neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7579)|
| 2:06:26| And I think everybody exercised good stewardship in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| It took a long time to get there, but I think it turned out well given where we finally got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:40| I think it's a wrong message to say, Mr. Property Owner, you go out and you hold this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:51| and you don't do anything with it for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| Then you give part of it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| Then you agree that you'll actually build the road to county specifications and pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| and give it to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| And then you'll pay for the installation, the purchase and installation of a traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| and say to them, because they went through the process, now what they asked to do is what they asked to do four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| And MPC staff was saying it's a good idea then, just like they're saying it's a good idea now, to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| no, I don't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| I'm sorry that there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| I'd always appreciate it if I had matters where there wasn't any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| I don't get many of them, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| Owner of lots number one and two, you've heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| And I got shouted at and a bunch of loud comments from the audience about lot number three that sold and closed Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7662)|
| 2:07:53| He is well aware of this building going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| He has been shown what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| He has been shown where it's going to be located on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| And he says he's pleased as punch to have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| And he went ahead and bought and closed on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| Now, I've heard a lot of, and I hear the grumbling now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| and I've heard a lot of them say that it's going to somehow or other detract from their property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| There's no quantitative proof of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| And I'd suggest to you that the fact that they just sold and closed one within the last few days for the asking price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| indicates that it's not hurting their property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Mr. Cox has people who work for him who live in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| His daughter lives in this adjoining subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| He, when I get through, if you can get more time from him, you can have it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7719)|
| 2:08:49| And I suggest to you he's still got property in there for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| and it is not his object to destroy anybody's values or anything of the sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7732)|
| 2:08:58| He's building a quality building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| It is a neighborhood commercial with a, if you will, limited impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| It's been said two times by MPC, the staff, and they're looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| that this is what should be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| We'd ask that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| All yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| I think everybody's out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| So let's see if we've got some questions for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| Yes, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| How long have you all experienced opposition from the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:36| After this application for rezoning was filed is when it surfaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| So that was when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| We filed it in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| We filed it in June at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| In June, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| Have, in the process of entertaining the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| have you and Mr. Cox discussed alternatives to your development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7795)|
| 2:10:03| I understand Mr. Cox has had some discussions with some of the people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| My first awareness of opposition was when I saw some of the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:17| and stuff sent in to MPC staff when the rezoning request was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:23| But I have not myself asked them to go into any sort of a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7823)|
| 2:10:31| nor have I suggested that they meet with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| The things on the application, if they want to talk to me, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| The things that Mr. Cox is offering in terms of land and changes and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7838)|
| 2:10:45| have you calculated the cost to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7845)|
| 2:10:52| Is there any way to give a rough estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| It's hard to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Bruce Weitrick can probably tell you how much per linear foot the road construction would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7856)|
| 2:11:04| He's given up about a half acre or a little over a half acre, I think, of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| And across that frontage, I've got the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| They're all to scale, but I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| You know, I can say it's not inconsequential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| What do the lots sell for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| What does a normal, say, an average-sized lot sell for in the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:36| In the Wyndham Point subdivision, Ms. Linkhouse, who lives in there, is telling me $55,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:46| So that property would be equivalent to two lots that you're developing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| It would be equivalent to two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| If you wanted to put houses there, only two houses could go there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| But you would have a different issue or a different problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| And that being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| That being, number one, the, if you will, the proximity to the intersection, the proximity to the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7926)|
| 2:12:16| and, you know, the change, if you will, related to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| I don't know what to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| I would say probably two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:31| Okay. Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| John, would your client be open to zoning an office instead of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:46| that would limit the impact of the traffic coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| It's pretty much limited to about an eight to five, eight to six type of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| where you have very minimal traffic coming in to something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| I don't even know if the homeowners would even be considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| But I'm just trying to look at options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| I appreciate the suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| And we have had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| We really, really believe that for this location, CN is the better designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=7993)|
| 2:13:20| It gives a wider range of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| It, frankly, may wind up being an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| But we would really like the opportunity, if you will, to have that kind of person that I just mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| is somebody like a Clancy Optical or just an optometrist who has an attached dispensary, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8014)|
| 2:13:44| like an optical company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| If you go up on Gay Street and there's Clancy Optical and you walk right by it every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8026)|
| 2:13:52| you get an image of what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| The reason, as I said, that neighborhood commercial is necessary is because in an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| you can't have any sale of anything to retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:08| You know, you've got a situation there where that's just a perfect example of somebody who's got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:15| a great business and this would be a great location and he needs that additional feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8055)|
| 2:14:22| Now, what they were talking about is what Mr. Cox described to them as his personal office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| which looks very – I think it's probably the same plan, where he keeps his personal office as a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| and developer, and in that, he has to – he shows samples of carpet, cabinetry, cabinet tops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:44| certain styles of furnishings and this, that, and the other that he utilizes in his developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| so people can make a selection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| We couldn't do that in an office zone classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| That's the reason we asked for the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| Mr. Chairman, there's a gentleman back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| I think he would like to speak, and I'd like to give him two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| If you'll give your name and address to the record, it's 707.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| I'm Larry York of 7416 Wickham Road in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| I appreciate how the people of Wyndham Point feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| They don't feel very good about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| But in the Carnes community, we've got to look to the greater good, and the red light is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| And the reason I say that is Commissioner Lambert is sort of wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| He said we would be looking for somebody to be killed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| My friend, Kelly, was killed there several years ago, and we need that lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| And the only way I see that we're going to get it is with this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| Bruce, Commissioner Norman asked John how much is that worth, the donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8158)|
| 2:16:08| If we were to ask Winston Cox to purchase that and then how much money it would take, what he's talking about donating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:18| what kind of expense do you think that is if the county were to go in and buy that property and do what it takes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:26| I mean, what is the value of that in your best guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:32| I don't have a feel for the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| But we did do an estimate in regards to the actual grade work and paving and so forth that was going to be donated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8195)|
| 2:16:43| whether it was by Mr. Cox or Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| It made no difference to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| It might have been Ingalls that was making this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| I think at that time, this was about four years ago, was roughly $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| You need to add a signal in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| So a signal is going to start out of the box at $65,000 and, depending on the type of design, go up to $115,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8215)|
| 2:17:03| So we're talking upwards of $200,000 donation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:08| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| And that's what we calculated it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| Now, the county is participating in the sense that we're doing some paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| and we are doing the work on the fire station side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| We are handling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| We're doing that with in-house forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| The other savings to the county is because this is not a project that we will have to go out to bid because they're going to do the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8242)|
| 2:17:30| which saves us the cost of having to develop a set of detailed drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| Certainly, you need a set of drawings to do this, but not to the level of detail when you bid the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| So it's also saved us in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| And also, the developer to date has footed the bill for the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| Either the developer or Ingalls won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| I don't know which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Here again, it makes some difference to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| Well, Bruce, since I don't live in this district and I don't go through that intersection very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8270)|
| 2:17:59| you said earlier that this didn't have as high a priority as maybe some other intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:06| that you have to deal with throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| So I understand the need for a signal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| But I'm just trying to get a feel for how bad you think this intersection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8294)|
| 2:18:23| The geometry of the intersection makes it very difficult to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| You're at a skewed angle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| I'm sure the residents have become accustomed to dealing with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| but certainly for a driver that isn't familiar with it, I've been out there a few times, and it's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| Having said that, I want to point out that I have worse intersections than you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| One in your district, Westland Drive and North Shore, which I'm sure you're familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| It is competing with those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| I have no shortage of intersections that need improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| I do have a shortage of funds in which to improve those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| And this one, although it does need improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| it just doesn't make the cut when you compare it to all the other intersections that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| Mr. Law Director, you said that what's the conversation need to be since the gentleman brought up the third thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8352)|
| 2:19:23| There's been an allegation that the sunshine law was violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| So in order to cure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| the way you go about that is that a discussion is had among the persons who potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:40| it's been alleged, that violated the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| So look to the commissioners for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Vice Chairman, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| For discussion on myself, since I was lied on by Mr. Humphrey, I will be abstaining from voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| and I'll let you, my fellow commissioners, make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| Commissioner Kaywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| And just to let the law director know, the Corns Business Association meeting was sunshine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| so there was no sunshine violation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| And I believe all of the commissioners received an invitation to come out to the property and view the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| and that's where Commissioner Strickland and I happened to show up at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| We did not deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| We looked at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| We took measurements and we talked about the type of building and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| In the company of the man that lived in the first house on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| He can attest to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| We used his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Mr. Humphrey still won't admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| We used his tape measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| And I believe the only other instance that was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| I believe Mr. King said that the only commissioner there was Commissioner Kaywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| so there could be no sunshine violation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8464)|
| 2:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| Just for the sake of being sure that every card is turned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8467)|
| 2:21:13| back when I first went on to commission, back when Mark Kaywood was commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8473)|
| 2:21:20| he did show me the intersection and told me what the plans were for that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| And I think that's the only conversation I've had about this with any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| Working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Sixth district, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| I'd like to make a motion for approval per MPC recommendations with the following stipulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| The west wall of the building should be at least 60 feet from the curb of Wyndham Point Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| giving more room for landscaping and shielding the subdivision from the property on Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| The building north wall will be situated as far south on the property as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| and still comply with the MPC parking lot restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| The building will not be situated directly behind the east subdivision entrance sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| The building style will be similar to the homes in the Wyndham Point subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| The building will be all brick and will be the same brick used as the subdivision sign and the pool building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8531)|
| 2:22:18| Berms and landscaping will be installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| including fast-growing evergreen trees on the west and north side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:26| One question, if I may, commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| You started out with the west wall of the building being and I didn't get how far from the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8548)|
| 2:22:36| Sixty feet from the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8556)|
| 2:22:37| Sixty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| And I talked with Mr. Cox about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| I've talked to him late this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| I would ask for one small revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8565)|
| 2:22:49| I think we may be able to make that 60 feet, but he's gone back and looked at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| We would ask that you make that 50 feet rather than 60, and if we can get you 60 feet, we'll do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8574)|
| 2:23:02| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| The way we'll put it out of it will not be situated behind the entrance sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8583)|
| 2:23:10| We can deal with that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| Fifty feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| Second by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| Much better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| We're getting ready to vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| I'd like to ask one more thing to be put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8610)|
| 2:23:37| If this resolution gets passed, I would ask that the front entrance sign, which is not on Windham Point property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:44| be moved to a common area, which is located on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| That would be at their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| At your expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| No, at the developer's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| He paid to put it on his property, so he should pay to move it off his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| Would the developer be willing to just take that sign down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| How about I just take it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| Yes, just take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| I'll take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| It has to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| I'll make an amendment to the subdivision sign on the right side of the entrance to the Windham Point subdivision will be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8656)|
| 2:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| The second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| Is that okay with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| The traffic light, is that in the proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| Is that in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| The traffic light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| The traffic light is not in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| So how do we know that the traffic light is going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| That was part of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| So it's part of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| So it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| Well, I'd like to make an amendment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Have her strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Have her strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| If it's going to go this way, just have her strike it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| Strike what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Strike the sign move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| You want to leave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| We'll leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| If it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| I'll leave it where it is or I'll tear it down, whatever they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| Do you want the sign left where it is or do you want it torn down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| Can we proceed without and let them make that decision later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| I think it will work either way if it passes that you all can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| Do you think we want a roll call or voice vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| Let's try voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Do you want to strike that from the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Strike that from the motion, please, with the signage part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8737)|
| 2:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| Is that all right with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| That's all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| We'll try it with a voice vote and see if we can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8752)|

| 2:25:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| There's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| Not a hill or a puddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| 17 ayes, one no, and one abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8766)|
| 2:26:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8767)|
| 2:26:08| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| We've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| Some have been here longer than that because they were on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| But we've been in this session for five hours and over 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| and we've had one five-minute break, so I suggest we take another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| We'll take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8784)|
| 2:26:36| This is a resolution approving the amounts designated at fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| and at June 30, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8798)|

| 2:26:58| Seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Mr. Troyer, do you have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| Commissioner Leuthold's light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| I'd like to make one addition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| Bruce Weitrick has requested that he had a line item for his highway equipment of $650,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| and that be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:16| That's money that was in his budget in the 07 year was not spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| and he'd like the approval to carry that forward into the new year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| I'll make that part of my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Mr. Troyer, let me just make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| Are they some undesignated funds going back to somewhere out of this, or it's all being spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:36| There's a purpose for every single item on here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| So there's no cash going back into the general fund out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| That's not going to be already showing where it's going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| There's a purpose for each item, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| And, of course, the largest piece, I mean, it's split by fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| There's $2.5 million to the general fund, $4,000 for the library, $325,000 hotel-motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| $2 million for the highway, and $7 million for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| So it's specific to each fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| The $2.5 million going back to the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| What's that going to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| There's a list in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| It's split between the circuit court, civil sessions court, 4D child support, juvenile court clerk, juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| There's just no cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8904)|
| 2:28:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8907)|

| 2:28:38| So be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8918)|
| 2:28:39| Made by Commissioner Strickland, seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=8919)|

| 2:30:35| I think Tom is the guy that lives at my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| I'll just tell you what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| There was some discussion about her not wanting to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| She ended up deciding she wanted to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| So they were going to move Tom Pierce up from an alternate to a board member, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:54| But now everything has went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| She's going to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| So Tom said he's okay with staying as an alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| In fact, Mr. Pierce is the one that asked her to stay on for her second three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9059)|
| 2:31:05| She's the chair of the council right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| And Mr. Pierce was well aware of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| And he's the one that actually talked her into changing her mind to want to serve a second three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:17| We appreciate that just in case he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| The panel also indicated to me that she was willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| One time she decided that she didn't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| And then Mr. Pierce talked to her and said, you've been doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9085)|
| 2:31:32| Would you stay around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| So that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070827part2?start=9095)|
