| 1:54:41| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| that George Stokes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6888)|

| 1:55:04| and that is the people's choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| that's why we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=6906)|

| 1:57:05| Billy made some difficult decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| stand by him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| I respect him for making them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| and I enjoyed working for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| but when the time came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| during this last election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| for him to speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| George was not in that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| he did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| have anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| with him being fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| now whether they believe that or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| I was sitting right in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| he could have stood up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| he could have made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| that a personnel record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| didn't show very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| for this reason I'm saying this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| this is not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Billy Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| it's not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| George Dixbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| and it's not about any of the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| that are trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| get your support to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7108)|

| 1:58:33| that things change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| it affects the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| which then can affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| their concentration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| which causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| they worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| if they're going to have a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| if they're going to have insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| they worry about everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| and the talk starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| and then they're more interested in the talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Ms. Payler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| I'd like to ask you to please wrap it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| saying this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| I would like for the changing of the guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| to cease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| let Mr. Dixbury finish his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| he won't be here in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| just let him carry it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| I appreciate you listening to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7158)|

| 1:59:23| My name is Sharon Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7163)|

| 1:59:27| Homestead Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| I am the bookkeeper for the county clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| and I have known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| and worked with George Dixbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| for almost 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| since the term limits were enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| and Mr. Padgett was ousted from office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| replaced by Billy Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| who was then determined by the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| to be ineligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| and the office was left to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Chief Deputy Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| I have been through three audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| if you reappoint another person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| to replace George Dixbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| we will have another audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| during the time since Mr. Tindall left the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| we have been trying to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| a new general ledger, registration and title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| business tax, marriage and notary system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| the learning period has made us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| have to play catch up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| so the employees have to work extra hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| so another change is something they don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| with all these interruptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| the employees have had a tremendous amount of stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| we worry about being able to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| our jobs, our insurance and salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| to pay our bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| I'm not speaking against any of these candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| because Billy Tindall did a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| during his interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| and George Dixbury picked up where Mr. Tindall left off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| and has made sure that the BIS system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| has been installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| and has produced the results that the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| has required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| we have been able to turn over excess fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| to Knox County and continue to make the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| more accountable to the citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| therefore I'm asking you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| leave things as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| so the employees can concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| and get on with their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| of taking care of the residents of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| Ms. Ellis, is there any relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7268)|

| 2:01:12| Carol Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7272)|

| 2:01:16| that's why I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| I have Carol Ellis in our office too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| but I'm not related to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Carol and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| used to be sister-in-laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| I was married to her husband's brother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| but I am no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7289)|

| 2:03:23| that way the transition is very seamless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| whenever the new clerk comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| he said they have enough to tackle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| he'd like to make sure one project is finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| My name is Janice Weaver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| I live at 2807 Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| and I've come to speak on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Carol Ellis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| she did not ask me to speak for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| I asked her if I could speak for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| and I was most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| impressed that she wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| I've known Carol since she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| 16 years old and I've had a personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| relationship with her for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| I've watched her do these promotions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| for Halls High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| as a matter of fact she probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| has helped Halls High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| more than any citizen out there has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| and I've been very very impressed by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| what she did for Beaverdam on getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| their projects and their budget going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| building programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| and I know she is very instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| at Fairview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| also I'm very impressed with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| work ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| as I'm also a hard worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| and have retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| from one company and doing another job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| and I've watched Carol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| and her endeavor at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| and she has most impressed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| with how hard she works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| how dedicated she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| how her job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| is her importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| anything she's ever done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| whether it's church work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| family or job you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| 110% out of her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| now as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| why do I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| Carol would be the best candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| I think you need some continuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| I think all of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| standing up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| have good reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| are good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| I think we're well blessed that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| standing up here is a good person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| and I know most of them personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| but my viewpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| as a citizen is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| I think Mr. Stooksbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| is a fine man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| but your Democratic primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| spoke out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| so I think you've got to take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| what the public wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| that it needs to be someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| and I did from the get go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| think it needs to be someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| who was in the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| who worked the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| should have had the job to start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| now that's me as a citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| and me as someone who has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| out here in the public and worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| that you can have a lot of supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| but it would be nice to have somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| who really knows the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| who's worked the job day in and day out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| who's been there, who knows the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| who can interact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| the people and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| one good attribute with Carol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| is I was impressed today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| and this is the first time I've heard it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| that she thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| about incentives for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| when I worked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| Knox Utilities Board and I retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| from there for 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| there was a study they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| Tennessee did the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| that said you can hand people raises all day long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| and they like the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| but the way to get the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| out of them is praise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| and some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| recognition program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| I firmly believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| I think that Carol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| would be a great interim person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| for the next person who's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| take over, who the public elects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| because I think Carol's personality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| is that she would feed them with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| all the information that they remotely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| needed to make this smooth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| listening to me and thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| and I know y'all got a hard job ahead of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| Seeing none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| we're moving on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| the trustee. Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| can I make an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Since I work at the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| I'm not going to be recusing myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| from discussion and from the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| on that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| Duly noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| Francis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| before we move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| I see we have Foster Arnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| Republican nominee for the county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| and also the Democrat nominee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Amy Hensley Vandegriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| and I've heard publicly that Foster Arnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| Mr. Arnett did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| want to seek the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| and I don't know if we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| for Amy, Mr. Vandegriff or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7681)|
| 2:08:13| I like other candidates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| put their names out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| for the primary process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| was reluctant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| participate in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| I understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| hard work and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| that you put into getting to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| the people that come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| to introduce themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| so that's why you don't have my resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| I have a resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| The commitment I have made to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| to seek this office is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| it has no end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| I didn't sign up for the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| and try out to wear the jersey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| and sit on the bench for the next six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| I'm dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| and passionate about the job and the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7731)|

| 2:09:17| The Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7757)|

| 2:09:29| with state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7769)|

| 2:09:33| I will cross-train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7773)|

| 2:09:45| they will excel in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| I will eliminate positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| that don't require showing up to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| to get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Employees will be held accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7793)|

| 2:10:01| In addition to improving customer service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| I will change the face of job security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| by letting the employees know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| that they are only as useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| as the knowledge they can share with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Job security is not knowing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| that no one else knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| I will educate and teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| what you know to others effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| My experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| in the clerk's office and in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| has given me valuable insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| on what actions should be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| to ensure successful management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| of this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| Thank you for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| of this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| I'm confident that even in its short duration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| I will make a lasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| and positive impact on the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| its employees and the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Ms. Vandergriff, are you saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| that you now want the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| for 7 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| I want you to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| put my name on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| to sit out and let somebody else come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| or someone else stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| and do any further damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| to the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| I want you to know that I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| I already put my name up for the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| just by being on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| This is a different process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| You are putting your name up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| the appointment now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| I will, yes. I am, officially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| As of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| As of today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Are there any questions for Ms. Vandergriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| No, I just wondered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| if she was interested, so I guess I know now she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| Thank you, Commissioner Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| Yes, Ms. Vandergriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| you made a statement there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| that of course I am not aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| You eliminate the positions of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| that don't come to work and get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| Well, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| some employees getting emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| about the turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| and changing in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| I think the only reason to get emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| is if you have something to hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| showing up to work for 5 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| and getting paid for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| is something that I would want to hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Alright, you are saying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| and you do have proof of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| I think time records should be made public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| and if a personnel file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| is reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| it should show its positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| and negative content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| and make an educated decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| on what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| and that is what I plan to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| evaluating customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| not just on negative and hearsay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| and go from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| Well, I guess what you are telling me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| and I have been getting these time sheets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| on most everybody up here checking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| I need to get the time sheets out of the clerks office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| for 117 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| No, but I would start with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| changes that Billy Tindall made with parking cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| who had to pay for them, who didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| That is not what I am asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| I am asking you to make a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| that some people were getting paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| for staying at home, am I not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| Yes, that is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| and I believe the initial audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| found that to be correct as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| Okay, then what I need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| is find out the names of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| I guess then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| I think what you are referring to are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| ghost employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| Do any of those still exist that you know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| or have they all been removed with the audits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| No, some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| have been brought back to life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| and miraculously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| been a huge part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| of the success of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| but I think the true success of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| much like Elena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| pointed out in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| comments to you, lies in the hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| of the people that are on the front lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| the people that are actually hands on and doing the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| can't manage something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| that isn't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| I am really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| stability in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| I don't know if many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| have done the math but in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| when this election is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| this county, pretty much every office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| of this county and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| this commission has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| five times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| There was the first Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| that I was elected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| then there was the Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| with the appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| now there is the Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| without the appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| and now we are going to have a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| Knox County Government with temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| appointees and finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| in August, a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| before my second year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| anniversary, serving in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8089)|

| 2:14:53| government for a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| I think Iraq| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| and Afghanistan have more stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| governments than Knox County does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| at this point and while I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| certainly interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| tracking down any ghost employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| and keeping these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| folks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| basically stealing taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| money, I am also interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| stability. Would you be committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| to other than the ghost employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| would you be committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| to keeping the staff pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| stable? I know this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| really stressed me out a lot and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| that these employees who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Knox County is their only form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| employment, it has really stressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| them out as well. Would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| be committed to upholding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| stability with respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| to the people who are actually working for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| paychecks? Absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| I think it is important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| hold the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| accountable and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| the rewards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| program is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| accountability plays into that huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| that has been my platform all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| in my campaign is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| accountability throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Knox County Clerk's Office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| lead by example for other offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| and other offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| like Sherry Witt's office are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| leading us by example. I mean we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| don't have to just look within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| for answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| and sometimes the wisest person isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| who knows all the answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| but knows who to ask and will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| Commissioner Luto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| why here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| at the last minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| Public perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| has played a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| has played into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| Knox County politics for the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| hugely and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| the new Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| and other media sources have really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| kept us in the public's eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| and because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| before the primaries I said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| if I won that I wouldn't seek the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| because the appointment was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| basically a death sentence to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| the general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| then I thought about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| and I listened. I watched all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| forums on TV and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| listening to what people are saying and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| don't think that they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| they want to wait for change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| I think they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| you heard our voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| respond and I heard their voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| and I want them to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| especially the 17,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| that voted for me to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| that I am committed to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| and I'm not going to just take a break for six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| months and hope that nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| approved or disapproved on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| budget that's coming up that I'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| live with elected to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| goes awry. I'd like to be part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| to ensure stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| and accountability in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| I think we need to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| on that. Well Amy it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| concerns me that when we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| people and we ask for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| positions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| come forward. We asked them to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| here by last Friday to have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| resumes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| but the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| has been that we've allowed people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| get in but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| it just concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| knowing that you were running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| waiting until Commissioner Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| asked you. I mean it sounds like Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| Moore didn't even know that you were going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| you were interested in so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| it just comes as a complete surprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| and if you had not been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| to come down and say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| were you going to come on Wednesday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| and ask for the appointment or were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| just going to sit idly by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| passionate about this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| moved at the last minute to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| some of the comments that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| I agree with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| hopeful appointees on some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| issues but there are some points of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| contention. I agree that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| Billy Tindall made leaps and strides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| in improving the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| all of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| time consuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| and dedication task that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| to implement those kinds of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| and to have someone else to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| come in and take credit for it, it's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| you know in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| all of these decisions are going to be very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| we have some very fine people that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| applied for all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| this is going to be one of the more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| because there are so many good quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| candidates asking for this, a very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| and so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| glad now to know what your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| intentions are. I guess I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| to get back to Foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| and Foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| are your intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| have they changed at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| considering what you've just heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8399)|

| 2:20:05| that I will be elected by the people of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8405)|

| 2:20:09| No offense to anybody sitting in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| but I do agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| the people have spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| and I'm going to leave that decision up to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| of Knox County and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| to decide my fate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8421)|

| 2:20:31| You know Amy, I'm like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| Craig here. This surprises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| me. You said you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| just all of a sudden you're sitting out there thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| yet you come and you have prepared speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| so you've been in contact with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| about something. You talk about the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| that have spoken. Yeah, they've spoken. You've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| 17,000. Mr. Arnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| got over 27,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| but what concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| the most is this accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| believe I've read in the paper that several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| that you were coming in late for work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| quite a bit. Was that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| I held myself accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| for my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| and keeping my time and keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| My coming in to work late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| is not meaning that I'm coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| at 10 and leaving at 3. It means that I came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| at 8.05 and I wrote 8.05 on my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| card and I stayed until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| 5.45 and wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| 5.45. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| clerk's office has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| set up in their manual that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| they released in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8489)|

| 2:21:37| employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| you don't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| paid overtime. There's a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| misconception of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| clerk's office employees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| the really hands on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| people that are on the front lines making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| exorbitant amounts of money to do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| and be hateful which is just completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| You get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| from 8 to 5. You get paid 8 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| regardless of how many hours you work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| I don't know if you've ever been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| in a type of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| with your insurance company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| where you close maybe at 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| but you still got to get the bank deposit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| together. You still got to organize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| your paperwork and get everything in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| so that tomorrow you can start a fresh and new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| There's not one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| end of the month or beginning of the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| time that has passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| where employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| not just myself but other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| have worked until 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| 6.30, 6.45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| you stop getting paid at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| 5 o'clock. But you would continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| to do that because of our dedication to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| the job and do it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| So I stand by my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| records because I never falsified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| one time document. I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| have written 8.05 or 8.15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| but that 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| or 15 minutes was taken out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| my annual time that I accrued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| and that I earned by working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| Why did you leave? Did you leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| yourself? Were you fired? Tell me again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| I'm not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| with the reason that you left the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| I would compare what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| to me as a witch hunt within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| the last month and a half that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| Complaints or letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| of complaint were brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| my attention by John Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| Otherwise I wouldn't even have known about some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| them. Written all by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| George Tewksbury supporters and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| George Tewksbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| is the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| communicated these things to Billy Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| I think Mr. Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| was misguided in his choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| and he has conveyed that to me after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| the fact that he was wrong and that he would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| moved me away from George and not fired me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| had he known the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| That just sounds like a big patent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| place and to me if we put you back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| in that it's just going to stir up a hornet's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| nest. I am just so uncomfortable with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| and the way it was done here at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| I'm sorry ma'am but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| you would just stir that place all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| up. Commissioner Pinkston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| Yes I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| whether this would be appropriate or not but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| Mike Padgett's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| not here for me to ask him but would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| possible to bring Billy Tindall and George| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| Tewksbury back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| the podium? I would like to ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| what they know about this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| that's been working there for five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| and never shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| that's not what we're here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| today. That might be appropriate at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| regular commission meeting and I'd support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| that at a regular commission meeting. I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| but they've been accused of paying people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| and hiding records. Well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| They are in charge of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| clerk's office there. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| but that's not what. I think they should have a right to defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| themselves if someone sets up here and makes an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| accusation like that. I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| have a chance to defend themselves but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| not the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| I asked you Mr. Chairman if it was appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| and you've told me. Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| Commissioner Ballard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| Yes Amy. This is sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| a follow up and a tough question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| that by turning in your appointment late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| most of these other people that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| within the office and I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| the process here we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| more people from the fee office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| applying than any of the other offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| so there's probably a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| miscontent already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| and by stepping in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| at this time you've probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| not given a lot of notice or have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| a lot of people from that office to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| you and that is a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| concern of mine in that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| you're not supported within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| that office and this is supposed to be a period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| of stability. Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| address that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| are people's jobs on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| if you go in? I would love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| to address that because it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| to note that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| the East Town Mall office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| is open and the dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8751)|

| 2:25:55| extra hours and don't get paid overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| are there right now working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| so a lot of my support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| lies in that office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| There are people in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| office that support me. I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| in that office with a vendetta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| I'm going with a drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| and a clear vision on what needs to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| and I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| fire people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| left and right. I'm going to let them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| know accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| from the past is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| This is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| Get on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| or make your decision to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| I'm not planning on going in and firing a bunch of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| We have some very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| highly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| not trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| but by trade efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| clerks in that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| and they will stay in their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| might just not be in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| that they excel in and need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| to be cross trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| or trained to maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| their efficiency or their productivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| I'll just go back to Mr. Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| I know you said you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| don't want the appointment but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| maybe could you think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| and let us know next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| I understand your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| and you heard me talk at Fountain City when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| me and you both had an opportunity to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| and I said I'd do whatever the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| wanted me to do if I was the nominee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| which I'm not, you are, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| But there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| some important work that has to be done between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| 20th and August 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| I know the decision ends up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| but if you could just maybe consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| and that way both candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| would have an opportunity to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| Well, Mr. Moore, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| I appreciate your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| One of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| that I ran on was honor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| openness and standing by what I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| I was going to do in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| If I change my mind now, I've just told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| 28,000 people that I can't keep my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| promise and I'm just not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| do that. Mr. Moore, I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| I'm humbled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| by my support, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| that I need to stand by what I told the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| and that is you vote me in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| or you don't vote me in, but I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| to seek the appointment. But thank you, sir, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| Lambert. Amy, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| just have one more question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| In fact, I think Rebecca actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| witnessed this. I asked you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| out on the porch earlier if you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| decided whether to seek the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| and you said that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| had not decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| Did you come or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| do you just speak well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| quick on your feet or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| did you come with a prepared speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| just in case you decided to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| the appointment? And I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| what I want to say, at what moment did you make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| the decision to seek the appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| Honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| I've gone back and forth throughout this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| entire meeting hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| what people have to say, agreeing, thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| that there is hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| someone will take this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| and do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| justice in the next six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| and provide a good budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| a strong budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| one that's feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| that we can get by on with as little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| as possible overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| and payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| and salary and things like that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| too, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| not sure exactly what point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| I decided that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| if I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| But it was in this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| It was within this meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| Thank you, Ms. Vandegrift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8981)|
| 2:29:49| My name is Smitty Giles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| I live in 11426| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| Saga Lane in the Solway community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| in the northwest Knox County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| anybody else's head is spinning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| but mine is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| And I want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| each and every one of you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| service you provide for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| I want to thank all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| candidates that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| to seek appointment for their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| and their energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| As a voter and a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| that it would be best that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| if in your decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| of who you make for these appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| anyone that has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| stand in the general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| be held off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| until the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| your passion, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| I know that you're a very passionate person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| to seek this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| Foster, I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| to come forward right now, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| I'm just going to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| Though I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| not holding that against you, and I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| these commissioners don't hold that against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| I think that her passion has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| hit her deep in her heart, and she felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| the need to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| I've been sitting back here listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| to all the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| being made today, and as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| and a voter in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9076)|
| 2:31:18| I've been paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| attention to what's being said here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| especially in this particular race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| and appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| And before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| I came into this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| I had never heard of the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9090)|

| 2:31:36| and hearing her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| knowledge on the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| people getting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| and speaking in her behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| and judging on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| the people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9108)|
| 2:31:50| vote in the primaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| the voters have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| They spoke in the Democratic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| primary. They spoke over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| across the whole board that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| want change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| The best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| I see to handle this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| office without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9126)|
| 2:32:08| eroding the stability in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| is to put someone there that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| knowledgeable, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| from my observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| I think Carol Ellis is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| individual. And I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| to thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| This was just, I wasn't going to get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| here, but I was moved just as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| voter and a citizen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| voice this concern. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| that it would bring your commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| forward. Not only is Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| looking at your decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| but the state and the whole country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9156)|
| 2:32:38| is looking at Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| And we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| to move this county forward, and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| move it forward. So thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| very much, and good luck on your selections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| Mr. Tornett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| are you going to have a late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| change of heart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9176)|

| 2:33:04| I've recused myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| Just a reminder, but I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| Got a little sidetracked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9192)|
| 2:33:20| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| My name is Fred Fisk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9202)|

| 2:33:28| Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| to thank the commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| taking time out of their day to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| and for this important process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| I'd also like to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| the different people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| that was in my race| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| for the Republican nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| That was L.B. Steele, who was here earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| Steve Hill, Steve Rogers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| Roger Kane, and Hobart Lumpkin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| It was a great race, and it was a tight race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| and I was fortunate to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| the Republican nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| I'm running for the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| for several reasons, but the most important reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| is my experience within the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| I have over 18 and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| of experience in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9246)|

| 2:34:10| under then-trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9250)|

| 2:34:14| Thomas Schumpert was a trustee, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| Mike Lowe, and I've gained a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| world of knowledge from those men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| I've learned how the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| operates, the things to do, when to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| and why you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| I offer myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| qualifications as the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| that I should be trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| I'm going to make it short and sweet, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| if you have any questions, I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| Fred, this is more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| comment than a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| I just appreciate you being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9284)|

| 2:34:48| these are very unstable times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9290)|

| 2:34:54| we'll have had five different governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| in a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| but you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9298)|

| 2:35:08| even in unsure times, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| really appreciated working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| I know we worked with that church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| together that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| had some problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| their exemptions, and I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| to working with you in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| and I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| seeking this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| and I'm going to be supporting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| Mr. Pinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| Fred, I just want to say, looking at this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| boy, this trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| does more than I even thought about them doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| I thought all you did was collect the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| and put it in the bank, but man, you oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| so many things. I didn't even realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| that y'all monitored and audited the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| Knox County TIF and pilot programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9344)|

| 2:35:48| I can understand why y'all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| quite a few employees and everything, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| I want to commend you on the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9352)|

| 2:36:02| worked and trained over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9362)|

| 2:36:12| you can't afford to make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| We're very thorough in what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9374)|

| 2:37:16| of profound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| emotion or I'm about to cough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| So just please put it in context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| Initially, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| got into this thing because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| appeared as though the two candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| who were going to run for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| elected office had submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| resumes to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| I did not want the county commission to be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| unenviable position of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9460)|
| 2:37:42| casting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9462)|
| 2:37:44| vote for one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| And so I got in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| They got out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| And I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| at least you should have the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| to have as many options as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| just like voters, in order to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| the correct selection for who should sit with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| I thought perhaps that I could bring a sense of healing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| in this time of instability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| And yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| when I got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| a pang of doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| I felt as I saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Commissioner Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| give Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| a shirt, and I thought the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| healing has already begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| And he was good enough to hold it up and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| his picture taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| So perhaps my work here is already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| even before it began, just by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| I appreciate very much the work that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| I did not realize, I don't think, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| stamina that you have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| in order to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| I've been here almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| three hours now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| And speaking as a citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| thank you very much for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| You have my resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| so I'm happy to entertain any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| questions whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| Political, economical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| spiritual. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| Quick question for you, Kendall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| I think a commissioner needs to have a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| pulse on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| What have you done in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| How does the community know you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| Well, the community was introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| to me some years ago. I did run for state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| senate back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| 2002. I ran against Bill Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| and I lost. And then Bill Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| and Tim Burchett ran, and as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| Tim won. I have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| of respect for them. So at that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| time, I suppose that's the only time that my profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| has been raised in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| at least for public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| What have you done in the community, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| Oh, I understand what you're saying, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| I saw your biography, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9578)|
| 2:39:40| quite impressive about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| Only on my resume is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| what I have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9588)|
| 2:39:50| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| several other persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| who are seeking this office. Chuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| Williams, Mark Campin, Robert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| Have I left anybody out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| I think there's only the three others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| The three others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| What elevates you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| above them? Why should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| you be considered first and foremost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| among them? I did check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| their resumes, and I must say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| that Robert Wolfenbarger III's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| I know that Robert I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9622)|
| 2:40:24| and Robert II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| must be very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| And I want my daddy to be proud, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| What elevates me, I think, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| probably know that Robert Wolfenbarger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| the situation there may be contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| commission is fashionalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| at least from the outside looking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| And I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| that you need someone in here who may add to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| the volatility, as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| to someone who helped bring stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9652)|
| 2:40:54| come with no political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9654)|
| 2:40:56| axe to grind, no faction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9656)|
| 2:40:58| to join, no block to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9658)|
| 2:41:00| attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| What elevates me above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| or at least makes me qualified to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| with you during this contentious time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| is that I am committed to doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9668)|
| 2:41:10| what's right, but I also have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9670)|
| 2:41:12| open mind as to what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| I would rely on your experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| in these matters. I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| come with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9678)|
| 2:41:20| sort of agenda-changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9680)|
| 2:41:22| program, because I don't think that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| the appointees are here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| We need good, sound government. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| things to good government that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| That's sound policy, correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| procedure, and favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| perception. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| procedure went awry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| back in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| the perception has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| So we need to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| favorable perception back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| for the public to support county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| government. And I think you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| on that road. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| changes that have been made recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| are helping that situation out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| Well, first I wanted to say, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| the healing process between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| me and Mr. Harmon, while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| we often hold different viewpoints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| we both have an awful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| lot of respect for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| You know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| made some comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| I wasn't... It's Dr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| Dr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| You see, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| need for... No, I was the first one to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| you Dr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| Let me mediate if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| Just wanted to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| articulating a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| It was taken out of context. I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| not call him that. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| referring to some other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| that had...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| I just wanted to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| The healing process has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| sometimes in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| meeting, that was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| a seven or eight hour meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| when those comments were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| I had been at this courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| for 12 hours. I had arrived here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| morning with a trial of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| young man that attempted to kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| stressful times, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| do have a lot of respect for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| We represent different viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| A lot of times we'll go at it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| each other, but it's strictly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| representing viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| I may say, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| we see that you're passionate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| The reason that you're in elected office is because you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| passionate about what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| We both are, and we've actually both done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| television shows together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| and welcome any opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| With that said, I wanted to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| what is your political affiliation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Do you consider yourself more liberal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| more conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| more moderate? Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| I'm moderate, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| I would say. When I ran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| as I said, for State Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| it was on the Democratic ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| and generally speaking, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| agree with the Democrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| What I admire most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| and what I admire about Tim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| Burchett, for example, and getting to know him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| I did not know this before I got into the race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| but Tim and I had lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| We talked a lot. I got to know Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| Owen very well, and what I appreciate most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| of all in a politician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| is authenticity. I don't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| you disagreeing with me, as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| as you authentically believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9856)|
| 2:44:18| You're not playing politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| with it. You're not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| manipulate anything. You're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| telling me what you feel, and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9864)|
| 2:44:26| say honestly that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| I would have run against Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| had I beat Bill Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| but I really came away with a different opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9872)|
| 2:44:34| of Burchett. I think he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| just an authentic fellow, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| Well, you're absolutely right. I know him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| personally, and he is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9880)|
| 2:44:42| authentic person, and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9882)|
| 2:44:44| appreciate you submitting an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| I'll be strongly considering you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| Thank you very much. If I may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| Foster Ernest is not here, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| it was uplifting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| I think, to see that he stuck by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| his principles. I know how he's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| and that honesty inspires me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| Full disclosure, I just figured out I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9900)|
| 2:45:02| on two different pairs of socks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| I was thinking so hard about what I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| today that I think you need to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| honesty begins right here at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| and I want you to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| Thank you, too, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| Wells, for stepping forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| volunteering to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| issue of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| policies, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9926)|
| 2:45:28| had numerous things, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| that have come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| abbreviated with all the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| So of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| of some of those issues that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| aware of, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9942)|
| 2:45:44| or two or three that stand out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| to you and positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| that you've got on those, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| relative to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| things that have happened and been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| before us in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Well, I have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| reviewing what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| that you do, looking at the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| for example, of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| you've had, what it is you're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| and reading the blogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| who are angry, very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| Yes, it's quite exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9976)|
| 2:46:18| Of course, there's about ten of them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| pretty much keep the platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| people feel strongly about it, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| And I've had to familiarize myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| with what it is that you're facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| not only what has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| on, but what you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| to be facing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| with the Charter Amendment and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| I have tried not to dwell too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| on the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| the January 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| issues and so forth, because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| too much focus on the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| elevates it in importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| I've not made any determination on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| who's right and who's wrong, which power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| faction, if the sheriff had too much influence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| if the mayor had too much influence, that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| of thing. I've tried to concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| on, if I were appointed to the seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| what I would be facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| And those things are like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| the amendments that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| And I can give you an opinion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| that, if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10042)|
| 2:47:26| One of the things that bothers me a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10046)|
| 2:47:28| about it, just to give you an idea of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| I would go, and I'm open to, I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| to violate any law, but I would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| appreciate input on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| if I sat with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| But a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10058)|
| 2:47:40| not being able, for example, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| serve in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| I have difficulty with people right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| and now deciding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| for voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10070)|
| 2:47:52| who runs in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| I think that it takes out of the pool some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| qualified applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| who might otherwise not get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| because they have to choose between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| do I want to work for the county or do I want to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| the county. I think you should be able to do both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| Something might be able to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| And I would hope that there's some sort of program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| to educate the public on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| what it is they're doing. Because right now, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| a fervor for change, and somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| might just go in there and just start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| clicking the wheel and saying, I won't change, I won't change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| I won't change. But they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| to be educated and really think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| the impact of this in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| Not just this election in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| but from now on out, because it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| hard to change it back if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| Let me ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10118)|
| 2:48:40| some other specifics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| For many of the other Commissioner candidates, we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| about TIFs, tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| increment financing. What's your approach to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10128)|
| 2:48:54| It looks on the surface to be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| for development, for off-the-balance-sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| However, I think that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| grant a TIF, an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| because originally, as I understand it, it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| blighted areas, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| the but-for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| condition needs to be appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| Some communities I know have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| found an abandoned house, and all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| that's a blighted area. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| you're going in with huge development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| If it does not produce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| revenue, you're giving a tax break. If it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| not produce the revenue in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| who's going to be stuck with the bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| So that these things ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10174)|
| 2:49:36| granted judiciously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| and with careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| consideration about where they're going and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| they're going to produce what it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| the developer might be suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10184)|
| 2:49:46| To sell you something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| as some of you may know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| you always give the rosiest picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| possible in order to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| That's just part of the sales game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| The commissioner's job is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| to correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10198)|
| 2:50:00| and accurately assess as best as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| possible, as best you can, at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| time, if in fact these projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| will materialize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| and that the taxpayers will benefit in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| And what about your experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| with budgets? I mean, budgets are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| huge for the appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| I understand, sir. I have not bounced a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| in 30 years. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| the best I can give you on budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| I've never managed a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| a large budget, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| in matters such as, and I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| from the minute you dealt a lot with zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| you're handling some very difficult issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| Gentlemen, I must tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| that from the time I submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| my resume to save you from making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| difficult decision to the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| I'm here at the podium, I've been looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| at what you do. I have a different opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| of you, too. It's different on the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10244)|
| 2:50:46| looking in than it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| entertaining getting on the inside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| actually doing something about it. You do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| stuff. You're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10252)|
| 2:50:54| personal, the private. You're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| real property. You're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| people's lives and livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| And so careful consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| ought to be given. And I would give weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| to your experience. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| need to do that in those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| especially where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| zoning or tips or things like that is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| I would appreciate that if it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| violate any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| sunshine law or disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| My question is, would you be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| to wait for the appointment? If you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| the appointment, would you be willing to wait to be sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| Yes, sir. I would be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| to wait to be sworn in. Am I going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| to get it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| My voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| I hoped it would be in better shape because I know you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10302)|
| 2:51:44| Citadel, so I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| It would have been great to audition if I had a better mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| WNOX. I used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10308)|
| 2:51:50| to do that on John F. Kennedy. I was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| disc jockey. It's not on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| the resume, but there it is. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| Mr. Wills. Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| Is there anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| who would like to speak on behalf of Mr. Wills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| or about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| second district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| Seeing none, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10326)|

| 2:52:14| In a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10334)|
| 2:52:22| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| My name is Robert Boyd. I live at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| 3627 Riverview Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| my short resume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| in front of you, and I basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| will speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| First, I was born in Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| Tennessee. I grew up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| I left, of course, when I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| a young man, 17. I went in the Air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| Force. You can see I'm a veteran here of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| Korean War. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| written in the Appalachian Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| about my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| growing up here in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Tennessee. Basically, it's about some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| of the churches that I attended as a young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| man in Sevier County, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| Blount County, in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| I'm very proud of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| because it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| Appalachia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10394)|
| 2:53:16| about living and growing up in Appalachia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10396)|
| 2:53:18| and I am an Appalachian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| My family has been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| We have a graveyard up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| Sevierville where my grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| are buried, my mother, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| uncles. It's right across the street from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| the hospital up there, right off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| Donnelly Parton Road. There's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| cemetery up there, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| where my family is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| buried, and probably, I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| my sons will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| sure that I'm laying there beside them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| one day. Now, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| a young man, of course, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| came out of the service, I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| not stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| It was 1954,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| 55, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| I went to New York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| and that's where I was educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| That's where I got my education. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| I am a graduate from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10442)|
| 2:54:04| Boston High School. I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10444)|
| 2:54:06| proud of that. I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| extremely proud of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| the class of 52 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| Boston High School, and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| primary education was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| and I took that education, and I went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| north with it, and I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| very, very well with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| the education that I got here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| Tennessee, and as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10464)|
| 2:54:28| I'm also a college professor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| an English professor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| at Pellissippi. I'm very fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| to have that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| honored this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10482)|
| 2:54:46| they chose me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| to honor, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10488)|
| 2:54:50| because it was African American history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| I mean, Black History Month, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| so the college honored me with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| a nice, my biography and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| and they sent it out to the newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| I came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| after I graduated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| college, from Queens College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| in New York, I've always wanted to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| home. I longed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| come back home. On my whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| thing, I wanted to get back home to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| live. So in 1970,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| after finishing college, I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| back home. I came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| back home to teach. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| presented my credentials, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| I was assigned a teaching position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| at Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| School, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| from there, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| no, I want to teach in the school that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| attended. So I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Ms. Sarah Moore Green to transfer me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| to Vine Junior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| which was then in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| old Austin High Building, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| I taught there for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| and I could look out at my class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| I didn't have to take attendance. I just looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| at the faces. I said, oh, oh, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| and I knew them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| because I'd grown up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| with their parents, and even people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| came into the school. Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| of my friends, you mean Robert Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| is teaching? I can't believe it. So they came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| and yes, I was there because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| they knew that I came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| on the rough side of the mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| here in Tennessee as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| I was a street urchin, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| I am very, very, if you read my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| biography, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| I'm very, very proud of my accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| and what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| you have my resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| and you can see my credentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| there. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| a master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| in English from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| Columbia University. Now, I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| someone say, well, I'm not from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| Yale or Harvard, but I am from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| Columbia. I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| college education there in English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| Why did I come here? Why did I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| apply? And I applied late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| at the last moment. I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| mixed emotions. Eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| I really wanted to run for the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| but when I saw 19 applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| I said, well, for most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| 19, I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| someone will be involved that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| can support and I feel good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| about, and I didn't want to get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| in that. And then I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| to, after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| primaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| were over, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| I started to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| submit my request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| my interest, letter of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| early, that I was interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| in being appointed. But I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| no, somebody will be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10648)|
| 2:57:30| Then, when I saw the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10650)|
| 2:57:32| and I saw everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| you know, the people who had run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| for office, for the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| and that was the list. I said, wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| That's not, you know, they've run for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| office, some had won the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| and everything, and I was saying, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| is really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| the kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| if that's the choice that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10672)|
| 2:57:54| had to make, if that was the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| choices that you had to make, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10676)|
| 2:57:58| let me give them another choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10678)|
| 2:58:00| Let me put my name in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| At least they will have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| choice, someone who is not political,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| I'm not involved in politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| and I did not run. And I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| let me give them a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| You know, all of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| what's going on in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| The perception is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10700)|
| 2:58:22| It is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| Now, I bring to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| I offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10706)|

| 2:58:56| that Knoxville should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10736)|
| 2:58:58| have. You're going to make a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| statement with that. It's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10740)|

| 2:59:28| I didn't know her. I didn't even know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| But she knew me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| Herb Smith, standing right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| one of my students had recommended me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| He'll be calling me soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| to appear on his program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| So I am well-known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| I don't care where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| I don't care where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| Somebody in your area knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| Bob Boyd from, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| Mr. Boyd, he teaches at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| I am known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| and I can't walk into a store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| without seeing some of my students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| that I've had and taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| Mr. Barnes, you need to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| Okay. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| am here for you, and I've looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| at the duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| and I've said to myself, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| my credentials will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| I will be able, I'm going to leave it up to your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| I like what he said, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| experiences, if I'm pointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| I will yield to your experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| and your judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10824)|
| 3:00:26| as we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| for the decisions that have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10828)|
| 3:00:30| I'm a little nervous now because I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| sitting here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| But I do thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| for considering me and I ask for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10840)|
| 3:00:42| Mr. Boyd, I just want to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| really quickly, and I basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| want to give you an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| to I think maybe correct yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| When you said you'll look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| at us, what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10852)|
| 3:00:54| have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| if you get elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| if you get appointed to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| your vote will count just as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| as theirs will, and it will be your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| experiences that you'll be bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| to this. That's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| representative democracy works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| I'm not looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| for appointees that are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| go along and get along. I'm looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| appointees that are going to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| Well, you can rest assured I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| However, in the discussion, I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10884)|
| 3:01:26| you, now I've sat on boards before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10886)|
| 3:01:28| I've sat on school boards and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| we get a packet in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10890)|
| 3:01:32| Some of you asked for a package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| for the, I think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| something for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| budget. We'll get that in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| and I'll look at it and review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10900)|
| 3:01:42| But I'll also listen to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| because you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| have the experience in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| I don't have it. None of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| know whomever you appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| from the first district will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10912)|
| 3:01:54| be brand new. None of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10914)|
| 3:01:56| have sat on the board. None of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10916)|
| 3:01:58| will have sat on the board. Now I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| my credential, my education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| now if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| was, if I had a degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| in math, in some other area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| I might not be able to read, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| can read and write because I teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| the language. That's what I deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10932)|
| 3:02:14| So I can do it, but I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| also listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10936)|
| 3:02:22| Commissioner Ballard. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| I appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| being here, Robert. One thing that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10946)|
| 3:02:28| noticed here, you graduated in 1952.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10948)|
| 3:02:30| Were you in service long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10950)|
| 3:02:32| or what drove you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| It must have been some sort of passion or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10954)|
| 3:02:36| something that starts your education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| I guess 16 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10958)|
| 3:02:40| Oh, yes. I always wanted to be a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| And as I said, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| was homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10964)|
| 3:02:46| I was actually a homeless child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| I was 17 when I went in and had no place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| to stay. And I worked for a mosque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| and clothing store down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| So what happened was when I turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| 17, I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| only finished the 11th grade, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10978)|
| 3:03:00| And then I went in the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10980)|
| 3:03:02| the Air Force, and I was able to pass the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10982)|
| 3:03:04| And what I did, while I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| in the Air Force, I was a cryptographer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| So while I was in the Air Force, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| got a GED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| And I got a GED. And then when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| I got out of the Air Force, I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| to go to college. I always wanted to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| the scores, I scored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| high enough to get into Queens College, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| the City University of New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| But I couldn't do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11006)|
| 3:03:28| I didn't do well in college because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| I didn't have the study skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11010)|
| 3:03:32| I didn't have the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| I didn't have the... I had to brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| up on math, reading, writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| all the basics. So I went to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| I went to Jamaica High School at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| just because I've always wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| an education. My family were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| farmers over here. They couldn't read or write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| They couldn't read or write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| But they were smart. They were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| intelligent. My Uncle Ed, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| they could read the landscape and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| and they knew when it was lunchtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| And I worked in these fields with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| them. But they were not educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| And I always wanted an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| I wanted an education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| since I was a kid because I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| that was the way out of my situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| And that is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| I went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| back to school and then eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| went to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11058)|
| 3:04:20| It took me 10 years. I worked. I drove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11060)|
| 3:04:22| cab. I did everything. But I never stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11062)|
| 3:04:24| And that's what I tell my students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| Don't stop. Don't give up. Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| Finish the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| Finish the task. So that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| education. And that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11074)|
| 3:04:36| I'm such a passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| person about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| I hope I answered your question. I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| You did. I certainly admire you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11086)|
| 3:04:48| Thank you, Mr. Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| for your passion for the community. It's obvious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| that you've given back a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| and you're continuing to give back a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| And the fact that you're here shows that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| still want to continue giving. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| thank you very much for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| I said I would ask everyone that came up, so I'll ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| you, would you be willing to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| and be sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| after the appointment process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| Certainly. I would certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| be honored to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| You'll find me very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| cooperative. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| one to stare. You know, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| coming in. So whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| you ask, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11122)|
| 3:05:24| that will help your job, make your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| job easy, you can count on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11130)|
| 3:05:32| Thank you again, Mr. Boyd, for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| forward. I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| Especially I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| mention that you and I both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| are Appalachian Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| Could you speak to some issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| in the First District for us that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| important to you? One or two of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| that you'll try to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| forward in your time if you're appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| I think the issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| really concerns me most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| Public perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| It's so bad, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| right now. But you're moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| and you're doing a fine job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| You're going to change it. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11168)|
| 3:06:10| it's a lot of hassle right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| for all of you. You're looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| to stability. And this next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| six months, I don't know how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| people you will appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| that really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| have been, will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11182)|
| 3:06:24| also have run for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| office and will be elected. I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| You know, that's up to you to make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| that. But my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| major concern is public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| perception in the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| You know, really. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| all of us who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| are active in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11200)|
| 3:06:42| who live in that area. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| really, you know yourself, you can read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| the newspapers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| We don't want to continue to see negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| things, you know. And that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| concern. And I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| if, and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| I'm going to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| If you appoint me, and they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| say, wow, they've appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Bob Boyd. You can ask anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| And that will change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| perception that I, that's why I'm offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| my services to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| I want to help change that perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| And I know my reputation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| everything will do that. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| bringing you, here it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| in front of you. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| and I'm offering that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| you to help you change that perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| You'll be pleased. I don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| where you live. Ask them about Bob Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| And you'll see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| you know, they'll say, yeah, Bob Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11256)|
| 3:07:38| Chairman. We didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| ask a lot of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11260)|
| 3:07:42| that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11262)|
| 3:07:44| first, like Sherry Witt and Jimmy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11264)|
| 3:07:46| Jones, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| if they'd be supervising a relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| if they're appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| And I know they're all gone, but is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| way that we could get the people who are applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| for the county-wide to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| send something to the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| a response, if they have any family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| be in that office which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| they could be appointed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| I think that may help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| So what you're asking is that they would send something in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| Yeah, because I didn't know. Mr. O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| and wife worked in the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| and I didn't know that until Mr. Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| asked. And there's some of them we didn't ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| This is just the fee office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Yeah, I think that any of the four county-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| I have Jody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| Just a comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| I think this has been a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| We still have another meeting to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| Tuesday. I appreciate everyone who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| come forward, who has presented themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| for appointment. I would agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| my colleagues in that we do have a tough decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11328)|
| 3:08:50| and that we have a number of good people doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11330)|
| 3:08:52| I would say, though, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| commission bashing has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| been very prevalent over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| and my sense is that after Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| we're not going to be immune from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| because we're not going to please everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| And some of the appointments we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| people will agree with. Some that we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| they will not agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11348)|
| 3:09:10| But I know that each of us are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11350)|
| 3:09:12| look at it very carefully. We'll vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| our convictions, our consciences, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| these appointments done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| hopefully by that afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| on Wednesday. But I guess my point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11362)|
| 3:09:24| Mr. Chairman, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| we're not going to please everybody. This is not a perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| process and I hope that the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| realize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| we have gone through a process. I think it's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| process and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11374)|
| 3:09:36| we can turn another page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| in our commission chapter after Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11378)|
| 3:09:42| Commissioner Smith. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11382)|
| 3:09:44| what did you say about we're going to be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| after Tuesday's intergovernmental? What did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| you say we'd be doing? After intergovernmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| and finance, we'll have our wrap-up session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11390)|
| 3:09:52| for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| Okay. That would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11396)|
| 3:09:58| It's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| been documented and sent to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080216candidateforum?start=11400)|
