| 0:10:43| Okay. The original CIP was led in 2014. It was for a new impound office facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| The one we currently have is built on a landfill, so from time to time it does shift, it does move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| We have our facility services team out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| We jack it back up. We make it level again as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| The floors are cracking. The roof leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| For our team members to go to the restroom, they have to go outside and enter through an external restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| So there's just lots of opportunities to have a better building out there for our team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| as well as what we set forth for our public to come out there when they retrieve their vehicles to get their vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| and also the impound auctions that we hold out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| So I feel confident that our engineering team has fully vetted it to be sure that we are building on a good site now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| away from most of the landfill, where we have a plan to take out five feet of the soil, put good soil in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| and move it closer to the road will be, for the next 30, 40 years, it will be the building that we can live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=701)|
| 0:11:48| Okay. And then you got an increase in the contract by $10,000 right underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| That's for the inspection services from Mr. Caldwell and the architect to just close the loop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| and button it up as we move along with it to be sure that everything is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| Also, another thing they're going to do is have a ventilation system in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| so that any fumes that would come up out of the landfill will be removed from underneath in the crawl space and taken outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| So when do you all hope to break ground on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| I would hope as soon as possible. We've put it off, put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| We've said let's wait for the freeze-thaw cycle to go through again so we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| But certainly I'd like to see it this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| If we wait for one more freeze-thaw cycle to go through this spring to get it done and start moving from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| But certainly I wouldn't be opposed to starting tomorrow if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=766)|

| 0:12:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| 11C is the resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-17-0161| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| with Thomas Caldwell, architect for design services for the new city of Knoxville vehicle impoundment project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| increasing the contract amount by $10,000 for a new contract total of $52,400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| and extending the date of completion to May 31, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| 11D is the resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Messer Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| to provide professional construction manager at risk service for the redevelopment of the Tenova hospital site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| as the new public safety complex for an amount not to exceed $35,500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Is Jim York here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Jim, I'm not sure if you have this information readily available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| but what I'm wondering is this is $35 million and then the next item is almost $2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| Do you know what about the total is at this point that we spent on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| The total that we spent to date is probably maybe $200,000 to $300,000 to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| What we have is we have budgets that have been approved in the range of $46.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=860)|
| 0:14:30| That's $40 million for the public safety complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| and $6.5 million for the development of the north end of the Tenova site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| And I'm sure there will be other expenses that come up once we are furnishing the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| all of the equipment, or is that included in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Well, I think I handed out a breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Yeah, I set that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| If you'd like to look at this, Councilman Wallace had called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| and we had talked, or excuse me, I had called Councilman Wallace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| and also Councilwoman Welch had some questions about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and it is confusing because it's a large project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| So I went ahead and just did a summary budget, and we can run through the total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| So the total budget originally was $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| and in this current fiscal year Council may have recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Council approved an additional $6.5 million to take on the north campus of the Tenova property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| the St. Mary's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| So if you go down to the bottom, the total budget is $46.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| That's 100% of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| So we have hired and we have a contract in place for an owner's representative, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| I think you've all met Jonathan Grammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| He's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| He's with Volkert Engineering, and so they're experts in planning, design, bidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| and they're really a city employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| That's essentially what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| They represent the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| They have the skill set to manage a large, complicated project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| So that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| That's 3.5% of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| Let me say this, the $1627,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| that is assuming that Council would approve the amendment for the additional $6.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| which is next on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| The next part is the architectural design services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| and we have McCarty, Hulsapple McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| You've seen that contract, and they are on board for $2.6769,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=976)|
| 0:16:24| That's 5.6% of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| We also have QE2 on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| They're handling our environmental services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Right now they're wrapping up their due diligence on the environmental at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| and that is around a $245,000 contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| It's 0.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| And then what we're looking at right now with this resolution is hiring Messer Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| They would serve as our construction manager at risk, our CM at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| And they're responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| They're the contractor that's going to build the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| They're responsible for all demolition and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| And so the total amount allocated is $35,500,000, which is 76%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| You would expect most of that to go towards construction, demolition and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| And underneath that, under Messer, I've included how we've broken down their services and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1029)|
| 0:17:18| And then we've actually pulled out the F, F, and E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| so the furniture, fixtures, and equipment, the desks, tables, and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| We believe that the city purchasing department and Vulcan Engineering can acquire those F, F, and E items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| and we don't need to pay someone to be a third party for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| We can do that ourselves and save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| The same thing with our IT, our information technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| And then we have on the final line, the $3.7 million, we have an owner's contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| So we have an additional contingency on top of our construction contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Again, we've made a commitment that this would stay in budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| so we've done two cost analysis for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| and this is really the next step to move forward in design development with the contractor and move towards construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1078)|
| 0:18:07| And what are the plans with the North Tower part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| That will not be part of the public safety building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| No, the North Tower, you know, the site is an approved redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| so KCDC, actually I saw Mr. Bentley today from KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| they are in the process of negotiating a purchase and sales agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| So Lincoln Memorial University continues to have a strong interest in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| They would like to, they're going to have to move their nursing students and faculty out of the St. Mary's buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| but they want to renovate the first three floors and immediately get their nursing school back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| And then they want to add additional educational services to the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| And so we're working with KCDC on the agreements that would need to be approved by this body to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| And so that is still ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| David, let's go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| So, like on the impound project, we saw the contractors and they were listed and their pricing and so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1139)|
| 0:19:07| and we took the lowest bid and the most responsible bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| So how did that work with Messer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| We didn't get that kind of information, that kind of detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| And how did you select, how did you come about to select them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| And was it competitively bid and so forth and so on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| Yeah, so let me just talk about the differences in that procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| So it's my understanding that the fleet building was designed by our architect, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| and then that design was put out to bid to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| And it's a relatively small project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| It's still a significant amount of money, but it's a relatively small project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| so we can control and manage potential cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| With this project, we believe that the best approach is to do a construction manager at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| where we've got the designer and we have the contractor, and they come on and work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| So it's being designed while at the same time we're doing cost analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| And so that it's a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Instead of designing it and hoping that it's in budget, we will work towards what's called a guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| So the designer and the contractor work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| They come up and ultimately the contractor agrees to a GMP or a gross maximum price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| and we believe that's the best method for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| It's large and it's complicated and it's a redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| So the process, Mr. Evans is in the back, if you've got specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| I was not involved in the review, but it was a request for proposals, an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| There were four teams, and I would say, based on the summary I've been provided, all four teams were very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| They were all qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| I don't think any of them would have been appropriate for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Messer really distinguished themselves really for three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| They had the most competitive price, so they were the cheapest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| They had the most aggressive schedule, so they were very hungry to get moving on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| And they had a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| And so the evaluation committee looked at the proposals and believes that Messer is the most responsive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| The evaluation committee was comprised of purchasing, Mr. Grammer, Mr. Thurman, who works for McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| Hulsapple McCarty, a member of our engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I believe it was Sean Fitzpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Many of you know Mr. Fitzpatrick, who does construction management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| And so we had a broad group of people evaluate and select that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And so I think we feel comfortable that Messer is the top crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| So when you say price, would that be their fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| Because their fee is listed as a line item there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| So construction fee, profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| So a lot of their contract was based on what their fee was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| And I think the way that we structured this, their profit is up front, their construction fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| So let's look at those fees really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Pre-construction fee, that $98,000, that is the work that Messer will do in conjunction with the design team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| and design development to come up with that guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| And then the construction fee is their profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| That's what they're going to make on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| General conditions would be a site trailer, overhead for their staff to manage, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| The target cost of the work is what we believe the construction is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| And again, they're going to work through that as we get into design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| We've just done programming, moving into schematic design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| So that will continue to be refined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| And then there's a contingency in that number of $2.869.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| But their profit was the most competitive out of the other folks proposing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| So the $2.869, so that's to allow for unexpected overruns, but we've budgeted an amount to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| We've got overruns in the construction budget with Messer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| We also have an additional $3.7 in contingency, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| because we didn't want to go into this and have to come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| We believe that we've got the right budget, but we want to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| we've got an 8% contingency with the CM at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| and we have an additional 8% with just of our own dollars that could go into a lot of things if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| And so, Wendy, what's the time schedule out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| When do you expect to get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I'll have to call Jonathan to talk about the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Obviously, we want to execute this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| And I believe Representative from Messer is here in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| So, Jonathan, you'll come forward and just talk about the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| and when we hope to wrap up our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Jonathan Grammer, here working for the city on behalf of the city as the owner's rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| Jonathan, if you'll pull that mic down for me, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| The schedule that we have right now, we're in the schematic design phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| so what we'll do is in the next couple of weeks we'll bring in, if the council approves Messer tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| we'll bring them in, review the schematic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| and they'll have a time where they go back and do an estimate for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| to make sure that we're on budget with the current budget we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| And then SQE2 continues their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Right now we haven't found anything as far as hazardous material in the facility that would derail the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| Several things we've found have actually been favorable to us with our budget that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| So all that's going really well right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Later on in the fall we want to go ahead and start the abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| and demo of our three buildings that we're going to be reusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| So we're going to get Messer involved with that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| They'll need to bring in their subs to come in and do the abatement and demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| So we're going to start that early, and then that will allow us to get in the three buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| and see what the structure looks like to help McCarty to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| and finish the overall design for the tenant improvements and build out in those three buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| which right now we have that scheduled to start next spring in the April 2020 time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| So we'll work that from April 2020 up through the fall of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| But right now if we get Messer approved tonight, they'll get started right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| and then we'll have them on board to work with us from now until the fall of 2021 on the entire project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1511)|
| 0:25:22| I guess one last question for Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1522)|
| 0:25:32| Jim, we've already talked about before about issuing bonds to borrow the money to pay for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| but you're going to pay a good bit of it out of cash reserves until you get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| Yeah, last, I believe it was last July or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| council passed what we call a resolution of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| which allows us to use our existing cash to pay for costs up until we issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1555)|
| 0:26:06| And then we would take the bond proceeds and then repay ourselves to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| You know, you just heard kind of the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Obviously, major costs is not going to be happening for probably another year, year, year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1574)|
| 0:26:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| And so the plan will be to basically cash flow all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| At that point where we expect to see significant outlays of cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| that would be the best time to go to the bond market and borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| Do you watch at rates, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Are you trying to see where the market is and where it's going, rates, where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Is that a factor or not a factor at all in the next 18 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Obviously, you're going to weigh rates if they're appreciable exchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| I really don't think we're going to see very much there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| But if you did, you could move a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| You can move relatively quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| It probably takes two to three months to put a bond deal together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| What you've got to realize is that once you borrow, you start paying interest from that day forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| So you want to try and avoid borrowing up until the last moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| So you're just paying interest from that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| So, again, I still expect that it's probably going to be a year, maybe a year and a half before you'll actually go to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I just wanted to shift briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I know a project of this magnitude, there could be some hidden costs that we will see come about once the project starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| But I want to ask specifically about accessibility to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| Have we accounted for the projected increase in traffic, especially when school is in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Have we done any existing traffic studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| And do we potentially know how we would pay for where that money would come from if there were some additional infrastructure costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| that needed to happen to make it more accessible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Yeah, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| I think fortunately, Councilwoman McKenzie, that at the heyday of St. Mary's, there were about 2,500 employees that were on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1689)|
| 0:28:18| And so the infrastructure to support that actually really crept into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| You saw homes purchased and those lots consolidated in the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| And so I think the infrastructure, we believe, if you're confident based on the previous uses with the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| is more than adequate to meet the demands that will come into that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Again, if you look at the heyday of the hospital, 2,500 employees, doctors, others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| And so we feel confident that the road, Broadway, and the connections there are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| We're actually making some improvements along the Broadway corridor and along for our bicyclists along the road right there near the campus as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1729)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Oh, I felt like we, did we skip Andrew or do we care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I'm switching around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| It didn't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Sorry, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Just to clarify a couple of things, Mr. Brace or Mr. Gramer, I hope I got that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1755)|
| 0:29:21| So we picked Messer because it was the most competitive price, but they had the experience that made them stand out from the four applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1761)|
| 0:29:31| Four proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Four proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| There were four proposals as part of the procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| So going with that efficient price that they came with, we feel from the front end work of looking at things that we are going to stay within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1776)|
| 0:29:46| There's some confidence there that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| We feel confident that we are going to stay within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| And, you know, prior to this point, we had Benefield Rectors on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| They did a preliminary programming, did it work, and they determined it does from a programming perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| And are we in budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| And they confirmed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Volckert Engineering was then hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| They came in and analyzed Benefield Rectors numbers, and they confirmed that we were in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| And so we feel confident, especially with our contingencies, that we will be within budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| And then Messer proposed something that was within those budgets that meshed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| I mean, what Messer really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Messer will work towards the guaranteed maximum price, the GMP, with the designers throughout that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| And then my other question was, so these contingencies on the final line down here at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| as well as within the Messer construction line item here on our chart are both 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| Is that a lot of projects go with the 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| You have projects anywhere from 5% to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| So we went down, about down the middle, and did 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| So what we wanted to do in establishing the budget was make sure, with our estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| the contingency that you see with Messer is $35.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| That money is money that we estimate we will have to spend on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| So we have that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| We're going to be working toward the target cost through design, working the design and pricing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| And it's going to be a back-and-forth process over the next several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| to make sure that what we're designing is going to balance out with the funding that we're going for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| And so it's kind of going to be a give-and-take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| We're working with the police department, the fire department, pension, courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| to make sure that we're meeting their needs, but we're balancing the funds that we have available with the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| So we've kind of established in the RFP what the total cost would be, the $35.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| And so the lower we could get the pre-construction fee, the construction fee, and the general conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| obviously the more money we have to actually go toward the hard construction costs of the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| So when evaluating the four firms that submitted the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| obviously we graded them on their qualifications, their personnel, and the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| And like David said, all four firms were highly qualified firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| We would have been fine with any of the four that we selected, but the last selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| the last criteria came down to price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| And so because Messer had the lowest price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| they got all the points in that category that set them apart from the other three firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| And so what that did is that allows us to have more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| to go toward the actual construction costs of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| So we're going to be working that balancing act over the next several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| with design and pricing to make sure that we're getting everything that the end users need in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| And we anticipate, based on our estimates, the one that Benefield-Richter's did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| the one that we did, Volkert, when we came on board in the winter and early spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| is that we're going to spend the target costs and that contingency in there to get this project built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| The contingency that we have outside of Messer's contract will be up to you guys, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| to decide what you need to spend that on, whether it be furniture, fixtures and equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| whether it be IT or whether it be something else that the end users say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| hey, we really need this, it's not in this 35.5, do you want to take it out of this other 3.7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| So that money is up to the city officials and the administration to decide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| how you all want to spend that, if it's necessary to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| So that $3.7 million down there, bottom contingency, is not for labor materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| No, ma'am, that could be for anything that this council decides it needs to go for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| If the administration comes back with a recommendation that instead of spending the 1.9 on FF&E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| we need to spend 2.5, then you could take that additional $600,000 out of that 3.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| So currently that 3.7 million will be unallocated funds that can be used however the city sees fit as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2034)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| And we, like David said, we still have two additional items that we'll need to procure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| or purchase through the Voices Department, which is the FF&E and the IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| So those last three numbers down there right now are unallocated or unencumbered costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Mr. Brace, I wanted to continue the conversation a little bit about staying on budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| And I know last time we had this discussion we had a pretty thorough review of this due diligence period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| the 120 days, and we're still in that period of time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| Yeah, we are, and I think Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I committed to coming back to this council with a final update on the due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| especially the environmental assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| We are not fully complete on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And, again, we could still bump into what I would call a game-changing event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| If that happens, then we would pull back, and we still have the ability to do that legally with Messer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| At this point, though, we have not found anything that we did not expect to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| and actually some of the reports have been better than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| But we will come back with a full kind of a report on that due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| and the environmental assessment, as well as an update on the programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| and schematic work that has been done with fire and police and court and pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| I think that's gone very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Well, and that's the most, I think that's a critical piece to this because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| if we run into some environmental issue, then, you know, within the 120-day period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| we can adjust, I guess, to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| And the other protection that exists for that is what I already talked about with this, you know, CM at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| And so just to make sure we put it in terms that I think everyone can understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| the CM at risk is basically locking in a price for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| And the risk is on them that that fundamentally changes in some, you know, way that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| short of something very extraordinary happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Yeah, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| The contractor will work with the design team to come up with what they feel is a fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| guaranteed maximum price, and they'll lock that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Did you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| Boyce Evans, Deputy Director of the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| And this goes back to something Councilman Wallace, in fact, asked about a month ago, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2191)|
| 0:36:39| If you'll note, I think it's in the resolution or some of the paperwork you got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Messer is charged with coming back to the city with you're working right now with an estimated maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2203)|
| 0:36:53| But in the event there's unforeseen circumstances and that type thing, regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| they've got to come back with the GMP, guaranteed maximum price, sometime on or about October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| whatever time that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And if it doesn't exceed what we're going over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| then it does not need to come back to this legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| If it does, obviously we've got to come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| But I guess where I'm going is once we get that in, let's say it comes back and it's right in line with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| then, yeah, back to I think where you're going and what Councilman Wallace asked at one time is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| if we go over it at that point, it's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure we reviewed those two pieces, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| And that contingency down there is, I mean, Jonathan's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| but it's also you really don't want to tap into that until you really get down to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| because in case there's unforeseen circumstances and that type thing, and that's what those funds are earmarked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| And this may be for Mr. Grammar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| but one of the concerns I've heard is because we're rehabbing a building versus going from the ground up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| that it would be inferior to, you know, a building that was built new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| And so I guess my question is, what steps are we taking to making sure we have a state-of-the-art police facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| You know, because it is, they do have special, the police department does have special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| It's not just office space that can serve the city hopefully for 50 or 75 years or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Right now what we're doing is we have been in the building on numerous occasions with McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| looking at the facilities and the structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| and trying to work with the end users to figure out how best to fit their specific needs into the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| We are using the three newest buildings on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| The structure of those buildings are in decent shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| I mean, we're going to have a good structure, good bones, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| to build back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Our plan is to go in and completely remove everything inside the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| the flooring, the ceilings, the walls, all the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| So everything will be coming out, will basically be down to a shelf space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| So the shelf space of the building is in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| We'll be able to rehab and redo, and it will look just like a new building on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| That was one thing we looked at early on was what condition are the buildings in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| That's why we're using the three newest buildings that are on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| So obviously, you know, it's not a new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| So, you know, there are some things that we will have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I mean, the face of the buildings, they are what they are, the shapes, the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, all that, you know, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| And so we've got to work within those parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| But as far as the inside of the building, we'll be able to completely redo everything in those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| So you're going to have all new restrooms, all new offices, all new flooring, all new ceilings, lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| Everything will be just like a brand-new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| We're just basically using the structure itself to go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| and save the money on what it would cost to build a brand-new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| Are there any sort of experts in doing law enforcement-type office and buildings brought in to advise on that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2410)|
| 0:40:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| We have – McCarty has a subconsultant, ADG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| They do police and fire headquarters all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| And they are a subconsultant to McCarty, and they've been meeting with us in every meeting that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| to work with us on making sure that what we're doing here is in line with what they see happening all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Just one last question to clarify with voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| When you talk about unforeseen circumstances, expenses, talking about that contracted risk price with the GM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2448)|
| 0:40:59| do you also include in that materials increases, like a hurricane hits, you know, one of the coasts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| and that drives up the cost of materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Are you just talking like we get in there, open up something, and it's not as stable, and it needs something more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| All of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| I mean, truly an unforeseen – the most common thing in this area of the country is the proverbial rock clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| if you were building from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| That doesn't necessarily apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| But absolutely, if the price of materials were to go up, and there was a sound reason for a change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| I mean, it was proved all the way back to the base source and, you know, before the GMP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2498)|
| 0:41:46| Once the GMP is in place, then we know what materials we're going to go out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| But it's really unforeseen circumstances, and barring anything that QE2 funds or somebody else right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| I suspect the people that are most tempted to get into the 3.7 will be everybody in the city and spotty here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2518)|
| 0:42:09| You know, we want something better than what we contracted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| It truly is unforeseen circumstances, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| And market fluctuations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| That as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2540)|

| 0:44:47| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| So, Council, just a little background for those in the audience, just a little context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| So, back in May, after, what, 90 or so public meetings and stakeholder meetings and two-and-a-half-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| process, Draft 5 was released, and Draft 5 of the Zoning Ordinance of the text and Draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2705)|
| 0:45:15| 4 of the zoning map became available, and so Council began working off of Draft 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| There are no more drafts to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| On May 14th and May 30th, Council had a special called, we had two special called meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| in which the text part of the ordinance was amended, and we tracked every amendment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| was made on either our Council-initiated worksheets or a staff-initiated worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| So, all changes have been tracked on Draft 5 through those two meetings, and then at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| the July 16th meeting, which is a regular Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Meanwhile, on June 13th, the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission again amended and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| approved the proposed Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| So, during the month of June, I think most Council members met one-on-one with Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| Green to review and submit their comments and any proposed revisions to Draft 4 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| zoning map, and there's continued to be discussions with staff and Council members on both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| text and on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| So, at the July 16th Council meeting, after making more amendments and plenty of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| discussion, Council approved the text of Recode-Knoxville on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| So, we are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| What just was read into the record would be for the second reading, second and final reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| on the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| The document does not go into effect until there are two readings on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| So, tonight we have a couple of items to discuss that has gone out in the packet and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2823)|
| 0:47:14| some additional requests for amendments from Councilman Roberto, and we will start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| those, that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| But I do want to tell Council we have several people who have signed up to speak, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| guess I'll go down and see whether you want to speak in general at this point or whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| you want to, there's a particular item that's coming up that you want to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| So, when I call your name, if you can tell me if you want to speak in general, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| think if Council's ready, we'll go ahead and have them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Mayor, I think I want to address something that a lot of the speakers may be here about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| About the ADUs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| So, do we want to go ahead and deal with that issue then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| I just kind of want to clear the plate with that because it's settled and it's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| We just have to work on the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| It was voted and approved two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| So, if it's okay, I want to clarify what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| So, this has been heavy on my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Two weeks ago when we voted on a motion that was put forward for neighborhoods to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2898)|
| 0:48:26| to apply for EN status and during that procedure be able to choose not to have ADUs in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| In the past, or the established neighborhoods that are already in existence or will be with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| RECODE are about 22,000 square feet lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| So, to me, this felt very unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| What if I have a 5,000 square feet lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Why would I be exempt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| But EN moving forward, there will be no limit on the lot size at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| So, any neighborhood will be able to apply for EN status by going through the procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| and then if they choose to not allow ADUs in their neighborhood, they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Do you want to clarify that anymore, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Councilwoman Singh did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I looked back at the 2007 memo that was sent out when the EN neighborhoods were established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| that process was established, and it states the work is to create residential zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| that reflect the actual development pattern of established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| And then it goes on to say that those standards address dimensional standards, which are lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| size, setbacks, et cetera, design standards, and use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| So, that leaves it pretty open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| I think we're still working on the process, the threshold that a neighborhood would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| to achieve in order to be eligible for us to allocate the resources necessary for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| That's how large the neighborhood is, the amount of support among the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| We'll be working with Council to come up with standards for those procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I would assume that we'd use the same process that Council has used to initiate other zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| A Council member would propose a resolution to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Council would approve that resolution, directing planning staff to work with a certain neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| to go through the EN process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Then we would establish firm boundaries, ensure that there is support by a super majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| of the property owners in that neighborhood to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| We've learned from some recent examples that when we don't have neighborhood support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| some type of zoning study, it does not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| So, we'd work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| But again, all neighborhoods would be eligible to undertake that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| I think that there's criteria for support and the size of the neighborhood, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| So, my question is to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| So, we're on second reading, unlike we're on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| On first reading, we had opportunity to offer amendments on any wide range of things, vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Tonight, we're really limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Explain the difference between substantive changes and minor changes and what, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| make substantive changes, what that might, what that entails and may end up back on first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Kind of explain that and help me understand what the guidelines are, what we can offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| amendments on without or what we jeopardize if we make amendments that would be substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| And I would like to start off by distinguishing that from differences that would require it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| to go back to MPC again because it's a different standard with regard to those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| What we need to show with regard to something being studied at MPC is whether MPC has reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| the topic and had the opportunity to comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| And that has been presented before them and it's come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| And it doesn't matter then whether you change it after it comes to you so long as MPC has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| had the opportunity to weigh in on that particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| With regard to everything I think we'll talk about tonight, MPC will have seen and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| have had the opportunity to look at those items, those issues, and to weigh in on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3147)|
| 0:52:35| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| And they came up with whatever they came up with and sent it on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Now, at this point, it's a different thing because we passed it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| What we have to distinguish between is if you're offering amendment to what you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| on first reading, is it a substantive amendment so that it changes what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| Or is it just a clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| You're doing what you thought you were doing to start with, but you're clarifying it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| make sure that everybody can understand what it is that it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| You don't really change it substantively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| You just clarify what you did from the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| And so there are some amendments that I know that may come forward tonight that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| clarification amendments that will add some wording to make it more clear so it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| interpreted in the future in a way that people all understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| But you're not really changing the outcome of what you did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| But if you're changing the outcome of what you did before, if you're changing it in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| substantive fashion, that will have the impact of kicking it back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| So if you offer that amendment, pass that amendment, and it changes it substantively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| essentially what you'll be doing is kicking it back to first reading once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Kick back the whole thing back, not just that one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Kick the whole thing back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| The whole textual part, as you will recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| counsel separated the text part from the map part before we started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| Ultimately, before this is all over with, we've got to put them back together again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| But before we get to that, right now we're considering only the text part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| and so we would kick the text part back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| The map reading will be considered on first reading tonight if we get to that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| So we can't make, without jeopardizing going back to first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| we can't make substantive changes to the ADU, as Councilwoman Singh brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| We couldn't make substantive changes to that without jeopardizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| going back to first reading on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| If they are, in fact, substantive rather than clarification changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I just want to make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| I'm going to suggest that we go ahead to the council-initiated sheet, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| if you go to page 17, number 55, this is the only item in this worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| I just wanted to mention the handouts in the back with Fiona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| So Fiona has handouts for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Yeah, raise your hand and they will bring them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| You might have to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| I'm not sure how many copies, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| So on page 17, number 55, this is a correction to the language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| council voted to approve last meeting, July 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| Councilman Roberto's intended amendment was to allow ADUs as the default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| but to give neighborhoods the option of prohibiting them in a new EN application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| And that, in fact, is what all the discussion was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| After the meeting was over, when council, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| when our staff looked at what had actually been typed into the document and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| it indicated that they were prohibited unless they were voted to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| But that's not what the discussion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| So the amendment here is to revise 10.3.B.2 to read as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3369)|
| 0:56:18| However, in EN districts, ADUs shall be permitted unless the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| prohibits them in a new EN application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| And, Councilman Roberto, that was your intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| That was the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| And I think there were other council members that supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| That's what the discussion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| That was the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| And I agree with the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| So I can move to approve that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| And I do appreciate the clarification that was given by Director Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| that this would be allowed for all size lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| all neighborhoods are allowed to seek this EN status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| not only the neighborhoods that have half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| So every neighborhood has this choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Yes, if they meet the threshold criteria for coming in and undertaking a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| It's not an easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Not an easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| But it's not limited to only certain size lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Councilwoman Welch, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I just want to take a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| I'm muting myself to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| So the first sentence in green is staying in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| No, no, don't read the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Yeah, see, now that was the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And then look below to the revising, where it's blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| I added it as the ending sentence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| just so that you all could see it in the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| But what's highlighted there in the kind of gray shade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| that's what we're proposing it say instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| So, yeah, I'm sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| You're right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| So, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| So that first sentence, if we adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| that first green sentence will be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| And it will be substituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| I just want to make sure we get it right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| May I also make a comment about the EN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| I just want to acknowledge that that is a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| I mean, I was not around for the debate about EN process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| but that really was intended, I think, to be for large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| So I just want to note that that's a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| And I appreciate that it will be a high bar to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| and that it will require a great deal of staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| and community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| It's notable that we're going to open up the EN process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| for any neighborhood in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| So I'm not exactly sure what to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| But I appreciate the openness of MPC in looking at the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| We're not sure what we're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| Yeah, I can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Okay, so the motion, and do we have a second on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Do we have a second on this revision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| That ADU shall be permitted unless the neighborhood prohibits them in a new EN application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| Okay, now, is there anybody who came to discuss this that wants to be heard now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| based on what council is voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Anybody that signed up to speak that would like to be heard on this ADU as revised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Would anybody like to come down and speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| I can't see who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| So come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| Well, that's not in the EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Okay, so you're saying that's going to happen outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| We're talking about the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Is it going to happen at another meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| or MPC is going to bring back a recommendation at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| My understanding is, and Gerald, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| so my understanding, he's asking about are we changing EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| No, I think it's the way when Gerald, who most of us, some of us, some of us were around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| some of us weren't around when this happened, that in reading the EN requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| they themselves, we're not dealing with the EN requirements now in terms of size of lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3612)|
| 1:00:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| We're doing this because what got written down wasn't what was supposed to be written down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| and we needed to clarify that, that it wasn't what was actually proposed and what was debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| This is clarity on the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| Clarity on the language, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Clarifying the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| We're not talking about size of lots right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| No, we're not talking about size of lots now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Yes, ma'am, would you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| This is Debbie Phillips at 1307 Michaels Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Okay, we're a little bit confused as far as, okay, last two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| West Knoxville asked to be exempt from the additional dwellings on the properties due to their property size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3657)|
| 1:01:08| So I'm a resident of Norwood, and we have a lot bigger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| which I know you all are saying we're not talking lot size now, but we have established community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| I've lived at my same house since I was brought home from the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| My dad built my house in 1956.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| I've lived there all my life, and we have almost an acre of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| My neighbor next door has almost two acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| The lady lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| She was there when I came home from the hospital 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| When she died, her daughter took the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| Now the daughter died, the people that have the house now, they plan to stay there the rest of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| Everybody else on our street has been there since the 60s and 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| We have one person from the 90s, and we're an established neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| and all of Norwood community is established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And we would like to make the application to be exempt from the AUD or ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3729)|
| 1:02:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| And so, Mr. Green, you want to clarify that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| So first I want to say is that last week West Hills did not become exempt from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| What would happen is West Hills or any other neighborhood would have to apply for a new EN application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| and in that process get a super majority of their, with the process to be determined by the Planning Commission and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3757)|
| 1:02:47| But they would still have to go through a process in order to be able to prohibit ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| And what was said tonight, and correct me if I say this wrong, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| is that in reading the EN, the establishment of the EN district, that your neighborhood would be able to start that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3777)|
| 1:03:07| You would have to also meet all the steps that any other neighborhood would have to meet in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| if you get a super majority, whatever the council decides is that sweet spot of people to agree to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| then you could go through that process as well and prohibit ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| So what council is doing tonight is just saying that ADUs are permitted in West Hills and Norwood and every neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3803)|
| 1:03:33| unless you go through an EN process, meet the high bar that is set so that you're not taking away the rights of your neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3813)|
| 1:03:43| something they might want, and then get your EN passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| So that allows that either on special use or prohibited or whatever the neighborhood might decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| So this is really evening it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| That's what Councilwoman Singh, that's why she brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| She's been working on this hard since the last meeting to just make sure that there's an even playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3842)|
| 1:04:09| Every neighborhood who meets those EN standards can apply to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| That's how the language is going to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| The language is going to be changed to say that it's permitted in every neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| ADUs are permitted in every neighborhood unless you start a new EN application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| and in that application you get the majority of your property owners to agree that they want to restrict ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3873)|
| 1:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| But any neighborhood can start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| It doesn't mean that you'll complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| It doesn't mean that you'll get the right number of neighbors who agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| This will be, I'm sure, very divisive in neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| but it gives you the same opportunity as West Hills or Sequoia or any other neighborhood has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| You would have the same footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| That's what I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Did I answer that right, Mr. Law Director and Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Yes, you did, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Any other speakers who signed up who want to speak to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| I just wanted to clarify because I've gotten feedback on this motion that was passed last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| and I understand that it was controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| and I understand that some people don't feel an immense amount of comfort with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| but I feel that it's part of the continuing compromise process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| It is a tool in the toolbox that gives some people an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| If their neighborhood or a collective that meets the bars that will be set decide that this isn't the fit for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3942)|
| 1:05:53| which is what we've been hearing from small groups of people, then there's a tool in the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| No one got exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| I got e-mails from a few people about specific neighborhoods got exempted and they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| From my perspective, my neighborhood has always allowed these and has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| I know, obviously, we had a testimony from someone last time who needed that for their elderly parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| Many of us may have relatives or parents that this might be a good option for them to stay with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| but have their own privacy and have their own dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| I explained to my constituents that there are standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| You can't cover your entire lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| It would take a certain amount of money to be able to add this anyway, so I don't see it as being rampant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| but I feel like we've added multiple compromises that make folks feel like there's still choice in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| and that everybody's getting a little bit of something so that they have their property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| because there's two opposing viewpoints on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| We've been really working very hard to find balance with our constituents on both sides of this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| to try and find the sweet spot and get some fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| That was why I supported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Madam Mayor, before the vote, if I could suggest that in the last sentence that you're adding a word to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4035)|
| 1:07:24| however, an E-N district's ADU shall be permitted unless the neighborhood prohibits them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| in a new approved E-N application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| A new approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| I appreciate Councilwoman Ryder's comment because I'm beginning to feel like Neville Chamberlain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| No idea who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| Only those students of history know who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| I'm going to make a personal little thing since we had somebody give their personal testimony last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| so I'm going to be a little bit personal here about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Again, this is already allowed in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| As a funny note, one day my son was taking a very long time to get his shoes on to get to the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| and I kept yelling at him, get your shoes on, get to the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| And he said, Mom, I just can't stop thinking about, he's 10, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| I can't stop thinking about if I can't get a job someday and I can't make enough money to move out on my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| and take care of myself, where will I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| And I said, well, honey, good news for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Your mom's on city council and we're working on accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| which are already allowed in our neighborhood, but your dad and I will make sure that you have someplace to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| And I will preface it with saying my child has had a lot of health problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| so I don't know where he will end up someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| So I take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| I hear all the folks that say they don't feel comfort with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| but I also hear my child and I think about my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| And, you know, I've got to balance all of those concerns that I've been hit with from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| And so that's where my thinking and my vote came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| I put a tool in the toolbox for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| We'll see where this goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| It's in my neighborhood and it's been okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| And I have to say, that is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| This issue is one example, but there are so many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| This council has wrestled with different opinions and sometimes vehemently different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4158)|
| 1:09:27| But they have tried to reach that compromise on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| So thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Okay, any else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Jennifer, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Do we need a new motion since we've changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| With the approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| The second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Who had the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| That passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Okay, so that's the end of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Now, if we move, I'd like to move to the blue document, which is staff initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| If you look on page 10, there is only one new item that we're asking council to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4207)|
| 1:10:16| Page 10, number 19, last thing on the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| Christina or Gerald, do you want to explain this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| In the IRD district, the Industrial Research and Development District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| was a district that evolved from some of the districts that were identified in the earlier draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| We tried to ensure that all uses were appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| We allow healthcare facilities, which are hospitals, it was pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| as special use it was pointed out recently that we did not permit medical and dental offices and clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| which often cluster around healthcare facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| And that was unintentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| We propose that it also be identified as a special use in the IRD district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| to enable those smaller medical and dental offices to be located near larger healthcare facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| Again, it would be a special use, same as healthcare facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| Move to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Motion passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| So I actually, Mr. Green, I emailed him some changes just this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| so I'm not sure if those would be introduced now and they were just a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| or if that would be on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| Yes, so we'll get to that when we get to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| That would be on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Just wanted to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Okay, so now I'd like to move, again, let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| Is there anybody that wants to speak, that's signed up, that wants to speak in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| Marlene Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| You want to come on down and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| And watch the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| I'm Marlene Davis, and I live at 1935 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| And I'm here to just strongly support Recode Knoxville for two big major reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| First, the new category of mixed-use zoning along existing commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| will create new, amazing, walkable neighborhood districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| With residential units above commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| residents can park once and walk to restaurants, to the grocery, the drugstore, coffee shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| and even to nearby bus stops for transit downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| All of this pedestrian activity will energize small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| But also, all of this pedestrian activity will create less vehicular traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| as residents no longer need their car for every errand or every trip to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| The second big reason to support Recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| is that Recode Knoxville provides a wide range of affordable housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| The mixed-use residential commercial buildings might not appeal to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| but these will provide a range of condos, apartment choices for seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| for empty nesters, students, young couples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| Innovative housing ideas, such as micro-units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| can increase the type of units at the lower price range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| In existing single-use family residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Recode allows many diverse types of housing along a scale of affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| Single-family homes, smaller sites, smaller setbacks, smaller houses, duplexes, townhouses, and the ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| In addition to a general preference for single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| all of these housing choices provide smaller, more affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| as well as potential income streams for some homeowners with duplexes and possibly ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4445)|
| 1:14:12| ADUs have received a great deal of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Everyone knows that the tiny house trend for minimal living is appealing to some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| and it might be great for someone with a limited income, senior, student, young professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| So I support the ability for some areas of the city to make modifications, to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| This is smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| This keeps our different neighborhood identities unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| So as Knoxville grows and as housing demand increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| this range of more housing options within existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| will reduce the need for continued sprawl in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| So to summarize, we will see walkable neighborhoods in commercial districts of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| north, south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Secondly, Recode will significantly increase the range of housing choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| diversity of housing, and affordability of housing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| While letting existing neighborhoods retain their unique identity and sense of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| So finally, voting for Recode is important now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| and the new code will be flexible and continue to evolve in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| I've attended some of the 90 public meetings, along with many different workshops with different stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| I've also done some research into best practices and national trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| What works elsewhere isn't necessarily right for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| After two years of all this work, I think Recode Knoxville is the right thing for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| It's a great compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| I appreciate that MPC staff and city council welcomed comments from individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| and from all these different groups, such as residential associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| Knoxville Urban League, League of Women Voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| and professional organization of realtors, planners, developers, business owners, and architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| There are a lot of fingerprints on Recode Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| So thanks to all of you and your work in studying a very complex issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| and crafting a compromise approach for growth and for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| Recode will be good for Knoxville now and in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| So I hope to see city council pass this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Thank you very much, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Okay, is there anybody else who's got general comments? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| And if you keep an eye on the timer, we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4601)|
| 1:16:52| My name is Carl Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| I live at 328 Fallen Oak Circle, Seymour, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| And I wish to speak on the Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| First of all, I'd like to say that I think it's a great idea putting it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| But there's a few hiccups in it, there's a few hurdles in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| that I think they need to be worked out, and some of them are serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| But one of the things, and I can't seem to call it up here right now, I'm trying to find it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| just discovered within the past few days by reading some of the text in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| Recode is restricting the flying of the American flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| By restricting the size of a flagpole, you're restricting the American flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| You specifically state in Recode that you can fly the United States garrison-sized flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| That flag is 20 feet by 38 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| When you restrict a flagpole to 35 feet, you put 17 feet of the flag laying on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4667)|
| 1:17:56| Throughout this code, you have things on the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| In another section, you put the flag under signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| You don't specifically say American flag, but you do say flags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| And in that code, it's stated that if the flag flutters, either naturally or artificially, it's prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4688)|
| 1:18:19| I'm sorry, but the Tennessee Code, let me get it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| I apologize, but I had it on my computer and lost it, and I can't find it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| I'm looking for the Tennessee Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Anyway, I know the Tennessee Code put restrictions about three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| stopping municipalities from making any code or making any restrictions on flying the American flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| the MIPOW flag, or any branch of service flag on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| Recode specifically states no more than three flagpoles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| If you look behind me, behind you, there's four flags up there for the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| That is wrong according to recode under their new codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Military organizations represent all branches of service, some of them like the American Legion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| That's five branches of service that the state of Tennessee authorizes them to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| You add the Tennessee flag, the American flag, and the POW flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| That takes it up to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| Do you really want to be the first municipality in this state to put those restrictions on flying flags of the branches of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| the American flag, and the POW flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| These are serious things which is going to get national, and I'm sure it will be challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| Right now, I don't know of a garrison flag flying in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| but if you enact this restriction, I'm sure someone probably will challenge you on it and fly the flag, the American garrison flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4799)|
| 1:20:08| and I don't think they're going to let 17 feet of it lay on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4814)|
| 1:20:24| Gerald, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| We're trying to find where other than signs that may have fluttering flags are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| I've read this so many times I'd dream of it, and I don't recall any restrictions on flagpoles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| In my experience, flagpoles have typically been exempt from height standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| and I'll let Peter as a zoning administrator try to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| but I don't recall any where we limit the number or the height of flagpoles, especially those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Do you want to go ahead, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| On page 13-2 of recode, it's section 13.3, signs exempt from sign regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4859)|
| 1:21:11| Part T is in tango, official government flags is under exempt from sign regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| official government flags of which the following governmental entities are the only governmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| only official governmental flags recognized as such by the city, the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| any state, territory, or possession of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| any flag adopted as such by the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| any flag, any official flag adopted by any member state of the United Nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| So what does that say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| They're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| So they're exempt from the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| They're exempt from sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| But they're exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Oh, he's saying the height of the flagpole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| I just want to clarify, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| the part that he's referring to is in the sign ordinance that was passed in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| So what I would suggest is that staff go back in the law department and look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| and if any changes need to be made, it's certainly not the intent of recode to stop the flying of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4935)|
| 1:22:24| And so if this is something that's been in ordinance since 2015, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| Then let's take a look at it, and if it's something that needs to be changed, let's deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| And I would also point out that if there is anything in our code that's in conflict with state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| state law is going to prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| Good point there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you, Mr. Cook, for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| We'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| Anybody else with general comments about the text of recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| So, council, I think next we'd like to look at the revisions that Councilman Roberto sent everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| and staff has looked at this and have had we have extra copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4982)|
| 1:23:12| You have the copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| I have the copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Does council need these first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| Y'all got them in your e-mail, but we'll also share them with you here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| and then extras can go to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| So, basically, Councilman Roberto had 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| I think you had these maybe after the last meeting you sent these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Well, I think I sent them before the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Maybe before the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| They didn't have a chance to have comment by staff at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| So, staff has spent a lot of time looking at these proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| have had discussions with Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| and there are three at this time that we're comfortable with asking council to move ahead on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5032)|
| 1:24:02| And I have these are highlighted in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| The others, if we could tackle those three first, and then, Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| if you want the rest of them, mainly either staff is opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| or most of them they're recommending they go to stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| So, but if we could go ahead and deal with the three first, and then, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| whichever ones you want to make a comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| But most of these we're looking forward to dealing with them in stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Number one, you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Number one is in Article 2, Section 2.3 on page 219.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| And this deals with the definitions for parking lot and parking structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| And really what we're looking for is some clarification here with regard to the word operable in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5087)|
| 1:24:55| And I don't know if staff wants to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| I know that was something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| That's a good point that clarifies, and staff is comfortable with that revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| And it's shown up here in blue here that, again, staff does support that minor revision to the definition of parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| So we're adding operable in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| That would be the amendment to add the word operable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| That is approved 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| The next one is on the next page, number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| So this is in Article 10, Section 10.3, subsection V, outdoor storage accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| It's on page 10-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| And we're needing some revision here based on some of the items that are listed are actually outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5143)|
| 1:25:52| And staff has recommended those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| What staff is recommending to clarify the intent of the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| and it was always intended that certain uses could have outdoor sales and display, and not that they were that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5160)|
| 1:26:10| But staff recommends the following change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Under outdoor storage accessory 1V1, the following uses are permitted to have outdoor storage as an accessory use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5172)|
| 1:26:23| with the listing of those uses which could have outdoor storage as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| And they would be the amusement facilities, community market gardens, greenhouse nurseries, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| as set forth in the sentence in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| So I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Any discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| That is approved 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| And then number 7 on page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| This is one where we had spent a lot of time on trying to make sure that the ADU section didn't have a way of bypassing the language that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5218)|
| 1:27:10| And I know council spent a lot of time analyzing this language, and I appreciate staff's work on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5230)|
| 1:27:20| Basically the fix here is to clarify it and say that cooking facilities are prohibited in an accessory structure unless the structure also complies with Article 10.3B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5240)|
| 1:27:33| which is the ADU section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| So it closes a potential loophole, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| That's correct, and we appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| And staff does support that change, as stated by Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Those are the three that staff and Councilmember Roberto agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| And do you want to say anything else about these others at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| And I think there was at least one or two you wanted to make specific reference to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| Yes, Mayor, but I don't know if Councilperson Ryder wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| There are a few that I thought we should review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| Now, I really do appreciate the time that staff spent with me reviewing each of these and then responding to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| There are, I think most of these are appropriate for sending back to stakeholders, but there are some that I think we should at least talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5307)|
| 1:28:37| So the first one I would want to talk about is number three, which involves the matrix under storage yard, outdoor, secondary use, and storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5317)|
| 1:28:48| Now, in the last meeting, we made changes to these definitions, which I think was a positive move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| But what I'm concerned with is the S under storage yard, outdoor, in the CG zone, because that's supposed to be pedestrian-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5335)|
| 1:29:06| And I know when Marlene Davis came up and talked to us, it was about having access to pedestrian-friendly walkable areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5346)|
| 1:29:15| And so the question here was just about whether that's appropriate in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| And I don't know if that's kind of my narration on it, just asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| I don't know if staff wants to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| I'll respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| I think the special use provision provides adequate protection for those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| The special use provision requires a review by the Planning Commission with public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| Currently, that public notice involves a legal ad, which is the only thing required by the state legislation public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| But we also send a postcard to owners of property within 300 feet of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| We require a sign to be placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| We post that on our preliminary agenda, which comes out about a month before the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| We are working with the Office of Neighborhoods to set up a system whereby we can notify the representative of designated neighborhoods when something happens in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5401)|
| 1:30:13| so there's an adequate process and procedure for getting public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| And as a side note, I would think of Architectural Antics on Broadway, which is a proposed CG walkable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| That certainly piques my interest when I walk or drive by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| It's secondary outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| It works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| It fits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| I think we have to keep in mind that with that special use review, the Planning Commission and planning staff can recommend denial, approval with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5433)|
| 1:30:45| Those conditions can include the location of that outdoor storage as a secondary use, the size of it, screening of it, even the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5445)|
| 1:30:54| Maybe they have to take things in on every third Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| If that condition were placed, that would offend the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| So I think we have plenty of protection while providing the opportunity for uses like Architectural Antics to display their wares and create some interest along the street and in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5461)|
| 1:31:11| Again, we're trying to balance that compromise of providing opportunities but ensuring protection and adequate voice for the surrounding neighbors to have a voice in the approval of these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5471)|
| 1:31:25| Is there an opportunity for an appeal to City Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| If the Planning Commission makes a decision, the neighborhood could appeal to the City Council under the special use provision or the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5489)|
| 1:31:39| If the applicant is not pleased with the outcome or the decision of the Planning Commission, the applicant could provide an appeal to the City Council, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5499)|
| 1:31:53| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| First of all, outdoor storage secondary or storage outdoor secondary, storage yard outdoor secondary can be larger than the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5520)|
| 1:32:10| It is not accessory storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| Second, it requires B buffering, opaque fence or wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5534)|
| 1:32:24| So it's not going to entice anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| It's a big blank space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| A B buffer is a 20-foot landscape strip with landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| It's not a wall or fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| It does include a wall or fence, though, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| No, it doesn't have to include a wall or fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| I'll look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| And as far as use on review, I look back at MPC minutes 2015, 16, 17, 18, and 19, 2014, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5563)|
| 1:33:02| and could not find any use on review that had been denied within the city limits by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5582)|
| 1:33:12| So, yes, they can be denied, but it appears they aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| Now, I could find some outside the city limits, and even those were very limited, had to do with state violations of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5595)|
| 1:33:27| Here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| This showed up in draft five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| There hasn't been a million months or 90 meetings to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| Draft five, May of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| It may be appropriate to have in a C3 zone where it would become CG, where we want mixed use, we want residents, we want all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5621)|
| 1:33:56| I would suggest, however, that we be a little bit humble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| Before we put it in the matrix and allow it as a special use, that we leave it out, since it is not what C3 allows at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5642)|
| 1:34:18| We leave it out and let the stakeholders committee and council and so on discuss putting it in to the matrix rather than putting it in and seeing what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5658)|
| 1:34:33| Again, I think this is a really important issue, and I appreciate it being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| Gerald, your example of architectural antics, I would consider that display, not storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5688)|
| 1:34:56| I guess that's a parsing of it, but if I'm going there to shop for a clawfoot tub, there's ten of them on display, and I can pick which color I want and which one has matching feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5696)|
| 1:35:08| It's not storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| I guess that's why I'm glad Mr. Ahrens makes those decisions, because I've seen the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| Yeah, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| For four years, I'm torn between whether it's display or storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| I think the storage example is like United Rentals and also what used to be Knoxton Rentals, where they're storing all the equipment that you're going to load up on the truck and take off in a storage yard, and those are quite large storage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5719)|
| 1:35:37| In special use, this has the review process and careful review, and as our staff suggests that the stakeholder committee review this and consider it more thoroughly so that if there are potential issues, we can address those through amendments that would be brought to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5737)|
| 1:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| So, can we just ask why it got added in draft five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| Was the example Mayo's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| There was a request from a couple of developers and property owners who thought that there may be a need for some limited storage in the CG zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5760)|
| 1:36:10| And again, trying to balance, as we've said many times, trying to balance the different sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| Those requests were to make it a permitted use in the CG, and that did not seem appropriate, so the compromise was to make it a special use and allow for public input and review during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5776)|
| 1:36:28| So, an additional review by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| I guess the issue at hand is they were never allowed in the current zoning, and so we're making a fundamental shift, and I'm curious as if the requested folks are confusing display with storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5792)|
| 1:36:45| That's something we can consider as we move forward, and occasionally we have to change the way we've been doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| I know it's difficult, but sometimes we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| Well, we have a definition for both going forward, so I guess we just decide everything's storage and nothing's display, or I think we're confusing the old and the new on display and storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5815)|
| 1:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Ms. English, did you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| This will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| As a member of the Stakeholder Committee, and as somebody who's observed this process, the process has been amazing, and we're at the 11th hour with the 59th minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5837)|
| 1:37:33| I think it's time to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Time to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| There can be corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| We all know that nothing is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| But where this is right now, you all have done a great job of reaching consensus on difficult issues, so this is not going to be immutable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5864)|
| 1:37:56| There will be plenty of opportunity for change, and particularly as the suggestion of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| So my applause to you all for all that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Thanks for what you and the rest of the Stakeholder Committee have done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| So we're moving on to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| What other topic did you want to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| I can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| The next one that I had I wanted to talk about was number six, which dealt with temporary outdoor sales, again, in the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5904)|
| 1:38:35| The CG keeps coming back because this is that pedestrian-oriented zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| And I know I spoke with Ms. English and Beardenville's council about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| But this is allowing for temporary auto sales and flea markets in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| The one point that I know staff made to me when we had this discussion, which I thought was important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| was that we did make changes to the temporary sales and outdoor uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5940)|
| 1:39:08| that in non-residential districts it's limited to no more than five days per event with a maximum of four events per calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5948)|
| 1:39:16| and they have to submit a management plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| Is that right, Mr. Ahrens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| So I did think this was important to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| Without those limitations, which weren't in there before, if I remember correctly, this one really becomes a difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5968)|
| 1:39:37| But I think with those limitations, unless I hear from any of my colleagues, I think that's probably okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Did somebody else say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| Number eight was the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| This has to do with recreational vehicles, and I really appreciate Peter getting back to me on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=5993)|
| 1:40:00| I've got your chart here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| So this really has to do with the number of recreational vehicles, hauling trailers, boat trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| as well as commercial vehicles that somebody could have at their residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| Right, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| And you had indicated to me that there were actually some more protections under RECO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| than there were under the current ordinance, and maybe you could go into what that looks like for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6021)|
| 1:40:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| In the current ordinance, we separate out RVs from commercial vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| Well, we do it in both, but under the current code, you're allowed to have one commercial vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| which would be considered a school bus or any vehicle with less than a 26,000 gross vehicle weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| Under RECO, we don't allow any commercial vehicles to be located in residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| so that's more restrictive than the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| When we talk about RVs, the current code allows a total of two out of these three choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6056)|
| 1:41:04| The current code separates out RVs from hauling trailers and boat trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| So you're allowed to have a boat trailer and an RV or any two of those combinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| Current code prohibits them from being located in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| And under RECO, there's not a maximum number of RVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| The definition of RV is all-inclusive, so we don't separate out all those different recreational-type vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| But there is no maximum, but they must be located in the interior or rear side yard or rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6088)|
| 1:41:37| They need to be 10 foot from the property line, so you cannot place them directly up against your neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| And they need to be screened from the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| So we're basically going from a limitation on number to, I guess there's still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| I guess technically there would be some limitation on number based on the size of the driveway and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| which we don't need to get into, but the screening is the additional element that we're gaining here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| You're losing the restriction on number of RVs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| but you're adding the protection of location on your property and the protection of screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Okay, so let me make sure I understood what you just said, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| You are not allowed a commercial vehicle including a school bus or excluding a school bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| No commercial vehicles under RECO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| So if you are a Knox County school bus driver, you cannot park that in your driveway, one singular bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| But if you are a KPD or a Knox County officer, deputy, and you drive your vehicle home, which is the common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6159)|
| 1:42:48| they could because those are government vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| They can because they're not a large commercial vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| They fit the standard passenger vehicle size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6177)|
| 1:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| I'm just not sure how I feel at this very second about banning school buses entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| I know I've had that complaint in one of my neighborhoods where it was multiples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| but I'm not sure that, I mean, does not everyone here have someone in their district that parks a school bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6198)|
| 1:43:28| Or do they all park in yards like at Fort Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| What kind of complaints do you get on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| And if any of my constituents want to step up, but, I mean, Mr. Lee, isn't there a residence in Holston Hills that the issue at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6215)|
| 1:43:47| I know this was a recent complaint was that they had multiple buses and multiple commercial vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| but they're limited under the current code to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| And they still have the one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Mr. Elder is not here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Oh, so he would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| I think not this summer, but the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| Anybody else have feelings about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Well, I think this is why this one needed to get brought up and probably needs to get sent back to the stakeholders to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| But it's an important one to discuss, because we're making a change on the number of vehicles, but we're adding screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6261)|
| 1:44:30| And then your point about commercial vehicles, I think that was a good point to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| And I think some of the point of having these discussions is so that we're giving some guidance to the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| on what they need to be looking at as they meet going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| And the staff recommendation on this is that the stakeholder committee review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| and this type of conversation does help us identify what issues need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| I appreciate it as a future staff to the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Well, I mean, I would want to hear back from the neighborhoods and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Nobody's brought that to my attention, but I'm very familiar with people parking a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| And it's funny that we opened up and made changes to home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| and had all this discussion about freedom of occupations and people being able to work from home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| but not if you drive a school bus, which is how my kids get to and from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| So I'm just, I mean, I think that deserves some further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| But I also know that it's limitation on numbers of vehicles is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Councilwoman Ryder, I just wanted to say that, yes, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| You're asking if people agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| I don't, it's not going to interfere with, I think this is a much larger commercial vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| but with trades vans that people use when they're working in the trades and bring their truck home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| If we want to talk practically speaking, if you've got your standard F-150 pickup truck, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| But if you've got your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| Semi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| Obviously your semi tractor is not going to be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Medium duty trucks, something that you see that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6374)|
| 1:46:22| Chevy van kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| If you get bigger than your Chevy van, that's when it becomes a nontraditional passenger type vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6384)|
| 1:46:31| And I think that's what the intent behind this section of recode was, trying to prohibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| was having those larger type vehicles parked in somebody's driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6397)|
| 1:46:46| I just don't want to prohibit people from being able to work out of their house now that we're okay with home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| So I'm hoping that's kept in consideration with the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Yeah, I was just thinking about another instance where that would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| What about if you operate a food truck and you park it at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| Is that illegal or would be illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| We'll leave that to the stakeholder committee to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| Under recode, it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| It depends on the size of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| It's another good example of something to discuss going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| That's why we needed to have this discussion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| The next one is number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| And this one, I think, is one that we need to have a discussion about because it involves signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6452)|
| 1:47:39| And I know that in our previous discussions about the sign ordinance, we were going to leave the sign ordinance alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6459)|
| 1:47:48| And I supported that during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| The issue is that the institutional zone didn't exist when we did the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| So there's an opportunity here for in a residential zone to have a commercial sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6477)|
| 1:48:05| In my discussions with staff, you all had said that this is, I think, an important point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6485)|
| 1:48:14| and one that really needs to get addressed before recode would go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| And we've heard from a council member that we may be directed to review certain aspects of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6501)|
| 1:48:27| We're already starting that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Our goal will be to have those revisions to the sign ordinance to the council in December prior to the planned implementation date for the new zoning code of January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6510)|
| 1:48:42| So this would be one of those items we would address would be the sign standards for uses in the institutional district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6522)|
| 1:48:49| when those uses are located abutting or surrounded by residential zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| Is there anyone from scenic Knoxville who wants to address these points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| Thank you, Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| Very briefly, this is something that kind of is slipping through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| We're really glad to see staff take this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| I think an excellent example of where this would need some attention would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| if you take Knoxville College, that's an institutional zone, but it's surrounded by residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| So, you know, you wouldn't want to necessarily, you know, but if you also have some other things that might be institutional that you might want smaller signs on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| I was thinking like Knoxville College, you wouldn't want to restrict them to maybe residential sized, you know, like 12 square foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6576)|
| 1:49:44| So, yeah, this one definitely we fully support working with the staff and everything to come up with a good balance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6584)|
| 1:49:51| Kevin, are you comfortable with a commitment by council and staff to address this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6591)|
| 1:49:59| Because RICO doesn't go into effect until January 1, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| But I just wanted to make sure that scenic Knoxville is comfortable with making sure we address this prior to implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6603)|
| 1:50:10| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| We're really comfortable working with staff and council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Jane Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| I'm not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| I've just never...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| When you're talking about approving an ordinance that you admit is flawed and is, in this case, missing important regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6625)|
| 1:50:40| and approving on second reading this ordinance with the promise that no one here can keep, that you'll fix it before it goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6640)|
| 1:50:52| I think you're doing something strange and usually that means either postpone it or fix it first in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| In other words, you're saying somebody somewhere through some mechanism before it goes into effect is going to do something very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6659)|
| 1:51:07| which we recognize is essential to be done, but no one can promise who's going to do it when, so trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| That's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| What you have before you regarding institutional zone is, first of all, in draft four, the signed ordinance was incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6677)|
| 1:51:27| But nobody noticed except the community forum that you forgot to put in institutional zone regulations for signs because it was a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6687)|
| 1:51:37| I guess the word search didn't pick up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6697)|
| 1:51:44| We asked in January that attention be paid for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| Four months later, draft five came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| The only thing that had been done was the word institutional zone was put in the bar for commercial and industrial signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6714)|
| 1:52:04| What you're looking at for institutional zone are properties such as schools, both public and private, that are sitting in residential zones and hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6724)|
| 1:52:19| Many of these things are in residential zones or they're in office zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| They're not in industrial commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| The signs that presently are permitted in draft five for institutional zone, and the institutional zone is not listed as an industrial or commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6746)|
| 1:52:37| It's listed as a special zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| These sign regulations would be for commercial and industrial properties, which are twice the size of what's allowed in office and much larger than what's allowed in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6762)|
| 1:52:55| None of you can promise this will get fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| None of you can promise this will get fixed by January 1 in implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6779)|
| 1:53:07| Again, passing an ordinance that you recognize is terribly flawed and that it be essential that this be fixed, or we're going to be doing something that's not going to be beneficial to our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6787)|
| 1:53:21| is certainly new and different and not something I would feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6807)|
| 1:53:36| Am I allowed to back up for a second, or am I only allowed to talk about institutional signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| Can we finish this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Sure, we can finish that, but I have to agree with Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| When I look at the commercial vehicle thing, there's a lot of things that I just feel a lot of discomfort with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| on passing something that people right now, it's legal for them, and then we suddenly make it illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6832)|
| 1:54:00| I'm not sure how these couple of things slipped through to this point in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| I'm not denigrating the Stakeholders Committee perspective, but anyway, I won't backtrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6845)|
| 1:54:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| The next item was number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| This, again, involves the sign ordinance, and in Article 13, Section 13.9, subsection F5E, this is on page 1317,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6860)|
| 1:54:32| allows additional signs to be approved by planning in CG, CH, CR, IRD, and IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6872)|
| 1:54:40| Currently, additional signs in these and all other districts have to go through the variance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| and I know staff and I talked about this, and if you want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| And that provision is in the current sign code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| allowing the Planning Commission to approve additional signage in the planned commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| planned industrial, all the planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| The Planning Commission has the authority to approve additional signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| There are no planned districts in the proposed new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| and rather than deleting this provision that's in the current sign code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| the decision was to allow the Planning Commission, this authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| similar districts, similar to the planned districts, which would be the CG, CH, CR, IRD, and IG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6924)|
| 1:55:34| In the four years since the adoption of the sign code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| the Planning Commission has had one request for additional signage in the planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| It's not a well-used provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| It is a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Notification is provided to surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| A sign is placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| The request is reviewed by planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| The Planning Commission must make a decision based on the information presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| There are standards set forth in this provision for the additional signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| topography, buildings that interfere with the line of sight of signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| and other standards that must be met in order for additional signage to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| Again, that is a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| If there are issues or impact on surrounding property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| they have the opportunity to review the request, to speak at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| There is also the avenue of appeal of the Planning Commission decision to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| So staff feels that that process is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| It has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| In one instance in four years where the request was made, there was no public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| It was in a shopping center and there were no public comments on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7000)|
| 1:56:51| Carly Malone, I'll try to be very, very quick on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| There's a big difference between planned zones, which we were getting rid of the planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| the I-1, the planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| where development plans are part of the required review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| In a shopping center zone, for instance, like the planned commercial and the shopping SC1, 2, and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| a use on review is required for the development plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| The sign is considered in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| The additional sign is considered in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| That was part of the discussion, context of the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| The physical layout, the size of the buildings, the colors, the setbacks, that was part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| During the several-year debate on signs from the sign committee, I guess it was, task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7059)|
| 1:57:50| This is applying that to regular zones, CH, CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| These are not planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Now, I guess in some, if you're a CG1 or 2 or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| then there may be some design standards, but the plain CG zone isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| This will be considered out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Why should extra signs go around the variance process to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| The variance process has standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| It's also a public meeting, also has public notice, and also comes to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| Why just signs get to be extra and not something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| It made more sense when it was part of a required development plan that had to go before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| but that's not what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Again, if you get rid of the planned zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| I think you might want to get rid of the provision that was put in specifically for those planned zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7131)|
| 1:58:59| If you want to extend that provision to non-planned zones, I think, again, some humility is worth something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7139)|
| 1:59:09| Let's take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Let the stakeholders committee consider putting it back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| and let there be a clear reason why this alone, signs alone, extra signs alone, are worthy of MPC review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7153)|
| 1:59:24| when everything else would have to go for a similar variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| would have to go before the Board of Zoning Appeals and their requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| Is there more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| That concludes the list that I had from my discussion with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| The other ones, they had all given me really adequate explanation for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7187)|
| 1:59:54| and I felt comfortable with sending it back to the stakeholders committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| Do you want to speak, Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| Am I allowed to go backwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| Give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| Can I stop you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| You can stop me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Oh, with my second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| So, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| I mean, we can sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| We are council, and we can decide that we want to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| and you guys can second it, and we can not, and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| we've been advised by staff that they'd rather certain things go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| stakeholders committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| but I have constituents that have food trucks that they make their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| livelihood off of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| and if I vote yes tonight on some of these changes in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| I'm fine with them having screening, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| changing that or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| but I'm not fine with making a vote that says to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| I just changed things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| because one of those particular people sent me an email and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| Lauren, if you believe this is the right thing, I trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| So I have to do the right thing by my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| and I can't support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Which one are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| On number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| So in our current ordinance, based on the feedback from staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| in the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| residential districts are limited to one commercial vehicle or school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| And when I read what's here on page 13-9 in the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| now I'm going by my printed one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| so it's always, I don't know if, Christina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| you want to bring up page 13-9 of the current revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7296)|
| 2:01:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| I'm on the wrong page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Good Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| 11-16 maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Yeah, 11-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| It's 11-16 and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| Page is 11-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| Page 11-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7322)|
| 2:02:11| Section 11-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| Section 11-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7334)|
| 2:02:15| So we have no commercial vehicle may be parked outdoors on a lot in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| residential district with the exception of loading and unloading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| standard size vehicles, sport utility vehicles, vans, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| Permitted commercial vehicles may include the commercial business painted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| on or applied vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| All other commercial vehicles, including but not limited to semi-truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| tractor units with or without, hold on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| are not permitted to be stored or parked outdoors overnight on a lot in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| Whereas the current text allows one school bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7369)|
| 2:02:56| and specifies that commercial vehicles, hauling trailers, boat trailers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| recreational vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| and school buses shall not be parked or stored on any lot improved with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| dwelling or on any lot zone residential except in accordance with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| following provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| One to each lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| only one of the following vehicles may be parked or stored per household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| living on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| A commercial vehicle which does not exceed 26,000 pounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| gross vehicle weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| I think from looking it up, the food trucks are usually under 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| A school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Because I have gotten confirmation that there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| the way school buses work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| you have the big companies like Gentry that have a yard with multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| but then you also have some individuals that own a bus and operate one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| singular bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7418)|
| 2:03:40| And I'm just not comfortable with changing that on them when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| complaints I've had from constituents are where it's multiples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| not singular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| So unless someone wants to tell me they have problems with going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| with the existing language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| and then if it wants to go to the stakeholders committee and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| stakeholders committee comes up with a reason to take it back out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| then that would come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| Well, the question is, is that a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| So it was sent it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| To first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7456)|
| 2:04:17| The whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| But not from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| It's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| It would be first reading before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| I wouldn't have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| Just would be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| If you pass it tonight with that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| then you would pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| This would be the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| Well, then my other option would be a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| I'm not opposed to recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| I'm just opposed to, I agree with what Ms. Malone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| We can sit here and have full intention of saying we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| hand off things to the stakeholders committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| but then there's no way that we can assure that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| For my constituents that I've suddenly made their livelihood not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| I've now required them to go find a storage place and pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| and I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7512)|
| 2:05:13| And the map's on first reading, so I don't see the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| It puts us in sync to do second reading of map and text at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| So, Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7523)|
| 2:05:30| I don't know if this is the right time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| I don't want to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Are you going to speak on to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| I'm speaking to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| And I didn't know Ms. Ryder was going to say what she just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| but that's really what I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| If we push this back to say that tonight is the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| it's not going to delay anything because you still have to have a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| reading on maps if you do first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| You're still going to be doing second reading of maps in two weeks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| So, if we end up calling this first reading again to make some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7568)|
| 2:06:14| changes, that is not going to cause any major problems for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| And I believe that Councilman Roberto's topics that he brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| that you have heard extensive discussion already from Ms. Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| representing Community Forum, which I'm the chairperson of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| I think you should take those up and vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| I mean, you've had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| If you want more discussion because you're going to be voting on it, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| So be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| But let's not act like if we have to go backwards a little bit and call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| this the first reading again that that's going to cause a major problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| Now, one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| Two weeks ago, we battled that out for a good five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| And at 11 o'clock, it was quite clear that everybody had had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| Nobody wanted to deal with the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| And, you know, it was pretty clear everybody had had plenty, including me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| And so that is what has necessitated doing this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| And Councilman Roberto said at the last meeting, at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| that he did have other amendments that he wished to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| And if it hadn't been for 11 o'clock at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| he would have brought them up at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| So I just urge us to let's not lose sight of what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7656)|
| 2:07:43| And if you all agree on what we've just gone over a little while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| in the last few minutes, that these things are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| and should be done now, then you should do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| You should discuss it fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| If you need more discussion on it before you vote, take more time and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| But don't be afraid on taking a vote tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| because that might then require this to be called first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7690)|
| 2:08:16| Jennifer Roach, 609 Weissgarber Road, Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| I have a couple of procedural questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| The effective date would be January 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| but if recoded text is voted in on second reading today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7706)|
| 2:08:35| there could still be amendments made to the text between now and the effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| Just as normal amendments are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| Specifically on the school bus issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| I know the school system is really lacking in bus drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| and this would make it a lot harder on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| but this wouldn't go into effect until January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| So even if it is passed today and it's a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| it's not going to make any constituents do anything differently until it goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| We're still taking a big chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| If you pass it with all of these known errors today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| we'd have to come back and make those changes basically immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7766)|
| 2:09:33| so it would be changed to correct those mistakes before January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| So we're not making anybody do anything today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| The effective date could be postponed or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| I'm not really comfortable with – I'm not sure which one I'm comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7783)|
| 2:09:48| I'm not advocating for either one here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| but I just want to be clear on what we're saying because I think Councilman Ryder was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| I'm going to make my constituents do something today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| Well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| I'm not advocating for pushing it through with mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| You're just reminding me it doesn't go into effect until January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| It doesn't go into effect until you decide the effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| But to the point of the school bus issues and the skilled tradespeople,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| when I worked for the Knoxville Symphony, their box truck was at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| I mean, a lot of local nonprofits have – we have a lot of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| we need skilled tradespeople and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I think this is a very integral change that needs to be made with emphasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7827)|
| 2:10:34| I mean, we have to make these changes, whether it's today on first reading again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| or whether it's after second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| We're going to hold you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| It's going to have to happen now or the next time, not in a few Council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| I think this is an issue that could be addressed before January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| and I think Council can do that without it going back to the Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| I don't think that it needs to slow down this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| I'm just looking through at the archives of our currently adopted zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| and since 1962 it's been amended at least 54 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| I mean, I think that there are like 54 different archives of changes that have happened to our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| We have a history of being able to make amendments to our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| So I would suggest that we move forward tonight and commit to looking at this issue before January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7894)|
| 2:11:44| But to be clear, the Stakeholder Committee will not meet before January 1, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| It doesn't have to go back to the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| I just want to make a clarification as to what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| Mr. Swanson can direct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| but the only requirement for an ordinance amendment is that it be reviewed by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| or recommendation by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| That recommendation brought forth through the City Council for review and hopefully adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| And the planning staff makes a commitment to work with plans review and inspections in the City Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7933)|
| 2:12:21| and have this amendment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| We can't get it on next week's Planning Commission agenda, but we can get it on the September agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7944)|
| 2:12:33| and have it to you by October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| I don't disagree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| To be honest, as we sit here and listen to the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| we understand the concerns and not wanting to make it hard for people to make their living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| This is one of those where the consultants put this in because of issues in other communities, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7973)|
| 2:13:00| And we looked at it and saw that there were some good provisions in it with regard to screening of commercial vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| or recreational vehicles parked in the yard, better standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| And quite frankly, didn't think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| We never heard the discussion before it was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| So we understand the issue and can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=7994)|
| 2:13:22| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| I'd like to make a motion that we replace section 11-11 and 11-12, which are found on page 11-17 of the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8005)|
| 2:13:36| In my draft, they're 11-17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| So are they 11-16 in yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| 11-16 in my draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| 11-16 in yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| So what is found in Article V, Section 8 of our current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| which starts with commercial vehicles, hauling trailers, boat trailers, recreational vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| and school buses shall not be parked or stored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| And then it goes Part A, Part B, and then Part C and Part D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8035)|
| 2:14:02| Recreational vehicles shall not be occupied either temporarily or permanently while it is parked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| or stored in any area except in a travel, trailer, court, or other location authorized under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| That's my motion, to replace the proposed text here with what's in our current code that we've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8053)|
| 2:14:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Yeah, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| Is that a substantial change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| So here's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| If this motion passes, it will push the whole thing back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8071)|
| 2:14:37| If it doesn't pass, then staff will work on the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8077)|
| 2:14:45| and we'll have it to council before the January implementation date, January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8085)|
| 2:14:51| So it's up to council which way you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I mean, to me, I'm fine with it pushing back to first reading because the map is first reading anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| So we're going to be, I mean, it's not going to pass anyway tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| So, I mean, to me, I think it makes sense to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| It seems like the majority of council, I haven't heard anybody oppose the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| If the majority of council is in favor of it and it makes sense, then we should go ahead and make the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8116)|
| 2:15:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Something I hadn't thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| I don't, you know, the school bus, there's probably a reason why we took it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8132)|
| 2:15:38| I can't, I can only think of one place that I've seen that had school bus, you know, and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8138)|
| 2:15:46| Food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Not food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| I think it's the school bus that I probably had the biggest hang-up about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| That's something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| I need to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| I don't know that, you know, without giving it any thought, asking that and putting that in there on the fly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8163)|
| 2:16:10| And if I may, Madam Mayor, we've identified issues with the antiquated language in the current code, the 26,000 pounds, other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8170)|
| 2:16:22| Putting that back in in its current wording puts a poorly manufactured Band-Aid, an old Band-Aid on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8182)|
| 2:16:30| The staff can work to bring forth an amendment that actually addresses current situations, addresses food trucks, allows those, allows the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8190)|
| 2:16:41| It sets modern-day standards for an issue that's a current issue as opposed to trying to put an old worn-out Band-Aid on the subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8201)|
| 2:16:51| Again, we have that, make that commitment to bring that amendment to the Planning Commission in September and then on to the City Council well before the implementation date of the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8211)|
| 2:17:04| I agree with Councilman Wallace that taking an old standard and trying to address a modern issue is not the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8224)|
| 2:17:12| Doing it on the fly is not the best approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| This does need some more thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| We can do that and bring forth an amendment that addresses the issue and does it in a good manner that will serve the city in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8236)|
| 2:17:25| Well, I think if you get down to January and you haven't done it, you postpone the effective date of the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| I mean, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| I mean, just push it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| I think doing that big a change on the fly, I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8253)|
| 2:17:43| So the issue, as you stated, is not about first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| It's about being able to make sure that the standard is correct for today rather than just replacing the former one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8266)|
| 2:17:55| That's your statement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| I'm James Waldrop, 1710 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| I just realized this may impact the churches in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| Most of them are remaining in R.N. zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| Most of them didn't make the institutional or other zonings that some of the other churches in different parts of town did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8290)|
| 2:18:17| So this would not allow most of them to have their buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| And a lot of the churches, especially in my side of town, run their little buses around to pick up elderly people and mostly children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8301)|
| 2:18:30| So this might cause them a pretty big grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| I know my personal church would struggle to meet the rezone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8313)|
| 2:18:41| and it may even cause them to just have to end the bus service altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| Okay, so there is more to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| Well, I had a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Well, I don't have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Okay, so we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| Are you speaking to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| I wanted to ask Director Swanson, is there a way, I mean, obviously the motion is substantive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8343)|
| 2:19:11| because it's replacing the current language in RECODE with the current language in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8351)|
| 2:19:18| but is there a way to address Councilperson Ryder's concern about school buses without making it a substantive change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8358)|
| 2:19:28| I can't conceive of how that could happen because you're going to be changing what is permitted or what is not permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8368)|
| 2:19:36| and so that's pretty substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| And then the other procedural question I have for you is we vote on first reading and second reading on the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8380)|
| 2:19:51| We vote on first reading and second reading on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| Do we then have to vote on any other amending, putting those two things together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| At some point in the process, and I would probably recommend on your second vote on the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| if that's the last thing you do that you include in that motion, recombining the maps and the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8408)|
| 2:20:16| or that could be done by separate motion, whichever Council prefers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| But probably the easiest way to do it is I move to combine the maps and the text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8420)|
| 2:20:29| and to adopt the maps on second reading is probably the motion that you would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| If we ended up going back to first reading today, because they would be happening at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8435)|
| 2:20:42| presuming that the maps pass tonight, they would both be at first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| Do we eliminate that procedural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8446)|
| 2:20:49| No, you're still going to have to include in your motion a recombining of the text and the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| You just wouldn't say you would approve them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| You move to approve both of them on second reading and to combine the text and the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| That would be the differentiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| Thank you. I just wanted to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| I am in agreement with Councilwoman Ryder that this particular section needs to be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8474)|
| 2:21:22| It needs to have some additional wording and consideration done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| I'm not comfortable that we know exactly what that is tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| I think we are in agreement that this needs to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| It needs to be more robust and really even more specific because it does not necessarily state the food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8495)|
| 2:21:41| That may be something that needs to be taken into consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| We as a council, and also the gentleman who brought up the issue of churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8504)|
| 2:21:50| something I had not considered, that there are actually church buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8510)|
| 2:21:53| and some people take a church bus home sometimes and also box vans for churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| So I think that there's a lot more work that needs to be done on this particular section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| We as a council, we drive what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| I would be comfortable moving forward knowing that we are expecting some language to come back to us to amend RECODE if it passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8527)|
| 2:22:21| and that we are committed to making that happen prior to November or December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| And it's not to say that even once it passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| there may be one or two other things that come to our attention that we'll need some additional guidance on that we may amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| But I think someone made it very clear that even if we were to pass RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| it does not go into effect until January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8561)|
| 2:22:45| We have until January 1st to make any amendments that we so choose or that we feel is necessary to enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| or if there are some things that come to our attention that we, just like this particular section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| we didn't realize some of these, I guess, regulations regarding the school buses and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8579)|
| 2:23:08| I don't hear complaints about school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| I'm sure that there probably are some out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| I just haven't heard them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| But I do think that we need to take some time and do a little bit more due diligence on this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| So we have a motion to basically revert to the current language in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8604)|
| 2:23:32| Do you want to go ahead with that based on the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8612)|
| 2:23:35| Well, I mean, my motion, and I've got a second, I don't know if they've reconsidered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| is to use language that the staff feels is outdated but on the other side of the coin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| We can go with what we, with the tried and true outdated language and fix that at the stakeholders committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8626)|
| 2:23:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| So I stick with my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| You all know what you're voting on, to revert, basically to revert to the current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8645)|
| 2:24:09| Is that the best way of saying it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| We'll need to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8662)|

| 2:24:24| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8664)|

| 2:24:26| Councilman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8666)|
| 2:24:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8667)|
| 2:24:28| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| Councilman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8672)|

| 2:24:34| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| Oh, excuse me, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8676)|
| 2:24:42| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| The motion passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| Still looking for staff to bring better language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| So you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| Well, Mayor, since we're back at first reading, I think we can go back and look at some motions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| on some of these we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| The first one we discussed was the S for storage outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| And what I had proposed was that we remove the S. This is in the matrix on 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8721)|
| 2:25:27| And I know we had a discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| So I would move that we remove the S on page 9-5 in the matrix under storage yard outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8731)|
| 2:25:37| secondary use in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| Councilmember Roberto, is this number three on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| Number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| It is three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8749)|
| 2:25:50| It's number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| Under storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| It's number three under the storage yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Remove S under the storage yard outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| And this is another one very similar to what Councilmember Ryder had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| You know, if we can look at this and put this back in at another date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| But if there's some updates here, it just doesn't seem consistent with what the orientation of the CG as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8769)|
| 2:26:19| to promote pedestrian oriented environment and emphasis on indoor activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| It doesn't seem to, you know, work well in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| So that's why I suggest we remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| Any discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8802)|
| 2:26:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| I guess I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| I would like to hear from, I mean, I know we were going to send this back to the stakeholder advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| but I really do sort of rely on our professional planning staff to provide a recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| At this point, our staff accepts council's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8816)|
| 2:27:03| Well, you just said a little while ago you all were recommending leaving it as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| At this point, staff will accept council's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| I mean, it's still their recommendation, but it's up to council to decide, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| So there is a motion and a second to remove S under storage yard, outdoor secondary use, and the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Number three on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8848)|
| 2:27:29| You ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| Amy Nolan, 17 Market Square with the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| I would say in a commercial district, this is a relatively significant change where we have told our members for the last six months to a year to evaluate the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8857)|
| 2:27:49| evaluate the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| They've worked with Gerald on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| And for many folks, this probably would have made a significant difference on how they evaluated the map and evaluated the ordinance on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8873)|
| 2:28:03| And I think it's kind of – I would agree that we should have a broad-based community discussion and stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| There's no – you know, we don't know of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| And this really could affect commerce and people's use of their building and how they have evaluated and engaged in this process so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8893)|
| 2:28:23| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| Thank you, Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| Again, this came in draft five as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| That's May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| It was not on the matrix before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| Draft five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| We're certainly interested in additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| Also keep in mind that accessory storage, which is smaller than the building – this is simply about whether in CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8923)|
| 2:28:55| which we say we want to be a walkable, mixed-use residential, mixed-use commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8935)|
| 2:29:04| whether or not in CG you want a storage yard larger than the building footprint as opposed to accessory storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8944)|
| 2:29:16| which simply means it's smaller than the building footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| CG is supposed to be a zone that mimics existing or old downtown districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8960)|
| 2:29:30| It's supposed to be primarily indoor, not outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| It is the existing mainly C3 zones, which do not allow large storage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8974)|
| 2:29:42| Certainly that's what differentiates C3 from C4, CG from CH in the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8982)|
| 2:29:50| Again, I would suggest caution and humility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=8990)|
| 2:30:00| You had a big discussion not too many months ago about outdoor storage in an area around the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9000)|
| 2:30:12| and what that zoning should be and whether or not that should be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9012)|
| 2:30:19| and whether or not it was good for residential and mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| This is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| You're looking at opening areas in Bearden, areas in Fountain City, areas in Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9027)|
| 2:30:38| that are having outdoor storage larger than a building, not outdoor display and sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| and not in the commercial, heavy commercial zone, the CH zone or the C4 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9044)|
| 2:30:52| where outdoor storage is required because it's big machinery and big outdoor things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9052)|
| 2:30:58| This is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| I would ask that you approve the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| Do you want to speak to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| Would you consider, if we pass this motion at this reading, which is now first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| because we've made a substantive change, and this changed at another reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| is that a substantive change, moving the S from the matrix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| If you make this change at another reading, that will be a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| That preempts another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| To the point that was made, if we make this change, this can go back to the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| and folks can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| This wouldn't currently be allowed in those same zones, as I'm aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| So it just seems inconsistent, and that's why it's being brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| It doesn't prevent the stakeholders from bringing this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| and bringing an amendment in January or February or whenever, just procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9120)|
| 2:32:12| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| It's basically number three here on this sheet, to remove S under storage yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| outdoor secondary use in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| You ready to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9149)|
| 2:32:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| Councilman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9160)|
| 2:32:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| Councilman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9162)|
| 2:32:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| Okay, that motion fails four to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9170)|
| 2:32:58| But that doesn't preclude the stakeholder committee in the future dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| Is everyone comfortable with the number six, the T for temporary outdoor sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9186)|
| 2:33:12| The deciding factor for me on that was really the discussion with staff that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9192)|
| 2:33:19| since we made the changes to temporary, which in non-residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| this limits it to no more than five days per event, with a maximum four events per calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9205)|
| 2:33:31| and a management plan had to be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| I feel like that had been addressed, but since we talked about it, I didn't want to just skip over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9214)|
| 2:33:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| Seems like everyone's okay with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| The signs is a more complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| You've got to take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| You've got to make a motion to take a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| I was saying that I felt like since we made the changes to the temporary already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| that was something we made a long time ago, and I think that really addresses that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| The sign issues, which we talked about in number nine and then number ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| I know we heard from Scenic Knoxville, and they were okay with having that go to stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9251)|
| 2:34:17| but since we discussed it, we might as well talk about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9257)|
| 2:34:24| This one, I think, is an important one, because if we don't address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| and recode goes into effect in January, then you can have something that's grandfathered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| where you're going to have it permanently there and there's nothing you can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| Well, he just said, and Gerald and I have talked about this in the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9282)|
| 2:34:49| looking at a few specific things in the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| and we've got to bring an ordinance to city council for MPC to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| and MPC to make those recommendations and bring it back to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| and get that done by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| We talked about this very specifically about the institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| along with a couple other minor changes that we hope to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| mainly items that Peter has seen the most issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| So, it's in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| We hope to get it on MPC's agenda in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| We hope to bring it to council in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| So, I mean, it's in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Now, whether we vote on it or not, whether we can get it passed or not, I mean, that is a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9325)|
| 2:35:31| But you do have the ability to extend recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| If you don't have this sign, it's not the way you want it, you can extend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| and say, well, we'll extend it until February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| I mean, you've got that ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| So, it's not like you're hemmed in if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| But it's certainly the intention, and we've seen this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| and we made a pledge, FNBAR and Marshall and Mark and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| and particularly me as co-chair of the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| the sign task force that we would bring back changes before the end of our term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9357)|
| 2:36:02| and that's when we intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| So, this is on the radar, and that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| I think that's, it's, but I can't, I don't think you can solve it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9366)|
| 2:36:12| I mean, it's way too complicated to sit here and try to solve it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| There's no way, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| Other, you know, but, I mean, Gerald has his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| Based on conversations with Councilmember Wallace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| Peter and I have started discussions about what needs to be addressed in the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| and a simple solution for the institutional district signage does not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| because we've got everything from a small, from a school, a private school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| because public schools would be exempt from the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| and the zoning code, to a large hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| And we can't put one blanket sign standard on those very different uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9406)|
| 2:36:53| and serve the community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| So, we'll look at this and come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| and our commitment is to have this to you for adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| before the implementation date of the new zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9421)|
| 2:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9435)|
| 2:37:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| I wanted to look at a different article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| I believe it's page 8 through 10, Article 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9440)|
| 2:37:23| Eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9443)|
| 2:37:24| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9444)|
| 2:37:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| Article 8.9C, the last sentence which was added at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9447)|
| 2:37:32| the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9452)|
| 2:37:34| followed by the procedure in Article 16.2.D and applying the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| in the Knoxville-Hillside Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| may issue a certificate of appropriateness for any application for any deviation from Article 8.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9462)|
| 2:37:49| And I just wanted to get Gerald's clarification here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9469)|
| 2:37:52| If the intent was to allow deviation from all provisions of 8.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| would that include allowing deviations from one acre or less B.2 provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9477)|
| 2:38:02| or lots that have not been issued a grading permit prior to the effective date of the code, B.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| Should Article 8.9 be changed to Article 8.9C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9488)|
| 2:38:12| which includes Table 8-6, Density and Land Disturbance Limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9492)|
| 2:38:17| but does not include Section 8.9B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9497)|
| 2:38:27| That would clarify that only the Density and Land Disturbance Standards could be deviated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9507)|
| 2:38:34| if that provision were inserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9517)|
| 2:38:38| As long as that's clear, I don't know if anybody wants to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| Is there anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| What's the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| Well, I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| Ms. Malone, anybody want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9531)|
| 2:38:59| I said if you put C in there, 8.9C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| it would clarify that the only deviations would be to the Density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9543)|
| 2:39:09| and the Land Disturbance Limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| Karlene Malone, I agree with Councilman Campin and Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9558)|
| 2:39:24| I think a motion should be made clarifying it to add the C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| so it's limited to the disturbance area, the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| So it's limited to C, not B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190730?start=9577)|
