| 2:37:07| It's law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| I'm just clarifying the question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9429)|
| 2:37:15| If you put the roadway right here where these trees are at on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| 25 feet is going to be on their doorstep almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| I don't necessarily think that we have to have 25 feet of right‑of‑way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| as long as the improvements were contained within the right‑of‑way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9448)|
| 2:37:36| Now, anything he dedicates and wants to create as a new county road would have to have 50 foot right‑of‑way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9456)|
| 2:37:43| 25 on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| So if he paves a new county road and we take access to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| 25 feet on each side of that road from the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| the road would be 10, 15 feet off their sidewalk and their front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9474)|
| 2:37:59| Looking at the map, that's a very difficult task when that's a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9484)|
| 2:38:11| My name is Valerie Brolls, 11906 East Herpin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| I want to speak a little bit to this, what Mr. Anders just brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| The property that they have offered to buy and have an agreement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| with the people on 12002 Couch Mill, what we're trying to stress is there is a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| if you look on KGIS, it appears that the owners of 12002 Couch Mill own that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9509)|
| 2:38:36| But what Mr. Burnett is trying to stress is he actually owns that section of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9516)|
| 2:38:42| up to the curve of Couch Mill where the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| I think the gentleman said he went out there on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| and saw the trees on the corner of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| That's actually Mr. Burnett's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| So what they're proposing to buy is going to shift their road over even further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9532)|
| 2:38:57| towards the home of the 12002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9537)|
| 2:39:03| We're going by what they gave us the day that we had the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9543)|
| 2:39:06| what their proposed site plan was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| their proposed entrance for their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| My other issue that we have is living on Turpin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| You're now going to have us that live on Turpin Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| which is the Knox County Road, cross their subdivision road just to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9559)|
| 2:39:25| We're worried about that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| not only about who actually owns this corner of land to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| There's just a lot of issues with this proposed development besides the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9571)|
| 2:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9579)|
| 2:39:40| I guess another question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| Is the owner of the proposed land here, 11915 Turpin that's being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| is the owner here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9589)|
| 2:39:50| I know Scott's probably got power of attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9590)|
| 2:39:54| My question is, I guess it's Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9594)|
| 2:40:01| So there's a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9601)|
| 2:40:02| We could either send it back or another look at the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9602)|
| 2:40:08| Same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9608)|
| 2:40:09| Same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| And I'd like to speak to that, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9612)|
| 2:40:13| And so if we deny this appeal, this property is locked in at what it is for 12 months, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9613)|
| 2:40:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| Go ahead, Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| Respectfully, I'd just like to state that all parties have had ample time to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| They knew what they were requesting when the applicant made their request for rezoning only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9629)|
| 2:40:37| They've been in this game for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| They knew there needed to be a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| and they just chose not to appeal that part of the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| I think it's greatly unfair to keep the community waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| I think you need to just go ahead and vote on what the applicant has requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| It's been explained that we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| Well, he can't appeal the sector plan to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| It has to be done through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| To see if this is a fair and reasonable compromise, there's obviously a lot of unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9668)|
| 2:41:15| If this body is agreeable to do so, I respectfully request to initiate the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9675)|
| 2:41:23| It would become incumbent upon us to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| and show how we can bring the road end to East Turpin and Couch Mill like we say we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| but we need to show you exactly how we can do it with engineer drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| and how we can widen Couch Mill all the way down to San Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| If we cannot prove that to you and we come back before this body, I would request that you deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9697)|
| 2:41:44| because then we cannot prove we can do what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| So this at least gives us to get the process moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9707)|
| 2:41:53| because to go from MPC to county commission, back on the sector plan, back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| that whole process is about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| So if this body is willing to do so, I respectfully request to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9722)|
| 2:42:08| vote to approve the initiation of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| and between now and the time it goes to MPC and back to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| it is my responsibility to come back to you to answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| And if I'm not able to do so, I will stand up here before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| and say I respectfully request you deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9742)|
| 2:42:34| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9754)|
| 2:42:37| Again, I just want to restate to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9757)|
| 2:42:40| there has been ample time to do everything that the applicant is now stating that they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9760)|
| 2:42:46| This community has taken every step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| We have looked at all compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| MPC heard every resident's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| They made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| They are the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| They are the professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| I'm fully aware that the developer has served on MPC and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| and is fully aware of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| And I feel like we're just trying to postpone and to buy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| I feel like we're playing politics here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| There are now two new MPC commissioners that they want to take it back to in front of to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9802)|
| 2:43:30| So we're trying to buy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| They are fully aware of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| They know what should have been done, what has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| And here we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| What compromises did the community offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9825)|
| 2:43:49| I want to also state every one of you have received several e-mails with background information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9829)|
| 2:43:56| and documentation, maps, deeds, everything we could possibly get our hands on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9836)|
| 2:44:04| You have copies of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9844)|
| 2:44:05| And I was thinking coming tonight that you would have reviewed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9845)|
| 2:44:10| and been aware of a lot of the questions that are already at play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9850)|
| 2:44:18| But as far as compromises, that was specifically laid out to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| the discussions that were so willingly had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| It was cooperative meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| But at the end of the day, the community came back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| we cannot compromise on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| So the compromises were, yes, discussed, they were offered, and they were refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9879)|
| 2:44:47| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9887)|
| 2:44:56| Commissioner Day had a question, and it was answered as the conversation progressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| Taking into consideration what was just asked for is not a part of what county commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9902)|
| 2:45:10| We do not look at disagreement with the implementation of a plan that's been worked on since the mid-1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9910)|
| 2:45:23| That's really one of the reasons we have zoning rules is so that the MPC can look at the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9923)|
| 2:45:32| and determine if what's being requested fits within what we have said has been allowed in a going forward basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9932)|
| 2:45:49| The main reason that's the way the system works is so that we do not have politics enter into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9949)|
| 2:45:58| and the heat of the moment be what determines the outcome of any one particular night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9958)|
| 2:46:05| In other words, we have a lot of rules, and as stated, the MPC should be the experts on what the rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9965)|
| 2:46:14| They make a decision, and they bring that decision to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| Now last week, excuse me, last month, we didn't have just one extremely controversial issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9981)|
| 2:46:31| We had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9991)|
| 2:46:34| In one of those issues, the question of spot zoning was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=9994)|
| 2:46:44| There's a certain rule of thumb in there that allows us to say because of the size of a request that it's not spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10004)|
| 2:46:58| This particular case, the size of the request, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10018)|
| 2:47:04| probably does conform with the fact or the issue that what we have here could be pretty close to being a spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10024)|
| 2:47:17| And no matter what we do tonight, if we do not make a decision, if we send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10037)|
| 2:47:25| I believe MPC has already looked at that particular circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10045)|
| 2:47:30| If I read the notes of their proceedings and what's occurred before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10050)|
| 2:47:38| that if this is a spot zoning, then their result will be no different next month or six months from now than it is tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10058)|
| 2:47:49| that this is a spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| So if this is a spot zoning, then there is no sector plan change, and the question before us is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10072)|
| 2:48:01| And we probably do not then need to send this back for a sector plan change because MPC would tell us it's spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10081)|
| 2:48:11| Now, the thing about roads, deeds, right of way, who's going to buy what and all that sort of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10091)|
| 2:48:19| that can still be a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| But if 12 or 13 acres a mile or more away from this kind of zoning would declare this to be a spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10102)|
| 2:48:37| then there's no need for us to send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| And then the second part of my story is when MPC sends us something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10120)|
| 2:48:50| we should be fairly confident that we should be following what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10130)|
| 2:49:00| what they're saying because they've reviewed everything that should be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| I'll just hang my one decision, though, on this one hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| I'll just hang my one hat on this one nail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| It's spot zoning and we probably would not see a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10151)|
| 2:49:17| Now then, are there other considerations just for my one point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10157)|
| 2:49:29| Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| If my memory serves me, I think at last month's meeting Mr. Sanders gave us a general definition of spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10171)|
| 2:49:43| Spot zoning is generally known as the change in land use for a small parcel of property to the benefit of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10183)|
| 2:49:54| and to the detriment of the surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10194)|
| 2:49:58| That's always a facts and circumstances analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| Last month we had a piece of property, a question I believe that was larger than 50 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10203)|
| 2:50:09| and I said that I'm not aware of a case in Tennessee or anywhere else where it's been considered spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10209)|
| 2:50:17| to rezone a parcel that large, that many acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| Obviously we're dealing with a smaller piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| I'm not aware of a case where there's been a 13 acre or 14 acre piece of property considered spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10226)|
| 2:50:33| but it very well could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| Like I said, it's always a facts and circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10235)|
| 2:50:39| The size of the parcel is not as important as the benefit that you confer on the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10239)|
| 2:50:47| and the alleged detriment that you impose on the surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10247)|
| 2:50:54| It's always a balancing of those factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10254)|
| 2:50:59| I hesitate to make a call on specific facts because it's our office's position to defend whatever the body does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10259)|
| 2:51:09| I can't say yes this is or no this isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| I can advise the county commission about the law, about the elements of that sort of cause of action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10272)|
| 2:51:19| and let the county commission make the decision for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| In all due respect, through the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| almost every piece of planned residential zoning from Steel Road west then would be considered spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10287)|
| 2:51:37| because almost every one of those pieces of properties, when they were rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10297)|
| 2:51:42| were completely surrounded by agricultural, some of which were bigger than this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| and some of which were smaller than that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10305)|
| 2:51:48| So does precedent not take some consideration when you're considering, quote, spot zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10308)|
| 2:51:55| Is precedent not factored into that to some degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| I'm going to decline to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10321)|
| 2:52:04| If the county commission wants to engage in that sort of question asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| I'm happy to answer one of the county commission's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| Yes, sir. No, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| Yes, Mr. Burroughs here, Jeff Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10332)|
| 2:52:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10338)|
| 2:52:19| You sent us a document that has three attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| One is the Burnett deed line document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10343)|
| 2:52:28| Where is that stored and what's the date on it and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| I mean, is it registered with the registered deeds office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| And I would like to also call my wife up here because she also did some of the research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| but based on our community, meaning that deed picture did come up and then we did go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10360)|
| 2:52:47| That actually comes from a lawsuit that dates back to 1992 between Mr. Burnett's father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10367)|
| 2:52:54| and the original landowner of the property in question of zoning, Mr. Strader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10374)|
| 2:52:59| There was a question of where the property line lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10379)|
| 2:53:02| That deed in question was part of that lawsuit that was filed in Knox County Chancellory Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10382)|
| 2:53:09| And it shows the property line coming all the way up in the piece of land that Mr. Burnett says he owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10389)|
| 2:53:16| and that was certified as the property, the division between the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10396)|
| 2:53:23| I'm going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10403)|
| 2:53:24| I'm going to look at registered deeds real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| I'll be right back with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10406)|
| 2:53:30| She gave it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| Did you not, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10413)|
| 2:53:34| You gave your name and address earlier, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| Yes, Valerie Broyles, 11906 East Herpin Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| I thought you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10418)|
| 2:53:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10419)|
| 2:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10420)|
| 2:53:41| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| Mr. Davis, do you have exact mileage to the school area there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| What I calculated today is right at one mile to the school property, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10428)|
| 2:53:54| Okay, driving, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| I did it two different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| I did it from the corner of the property down and I think it was 1.2 miles via drive and one mile as the crow flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10438)|
| 2:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| If my membership is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| I did it both ways, but yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| So then it made it one mile or 1.2 miles to the food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10450)|
| 2:54:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| All right, I guess for me the only additional consideration I've given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| I recall we had a similar appeal at last month's meeting since we've already mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10458)|
| 2:54:23| I think that appeal was granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| I recall I voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| For me, one additional consideration on this one is really just the proximity to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10467)|
| 2:54:34| I kind of like density closer to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| but I guess it's just something for all of my fellow commissioners to consider too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10477)|
| 2:54:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10483)|
| 2:54:54| Can I share some insight to your comments, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| The plan, the one we did 30 days ago that was inside the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10497)|
| 2:55:02| this is actually outside the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| I think that's worth some confusion and we're not apples and apples on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10504)|
| 2:55:17| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| Mr. Green, is this, when they say the growth plan, that's not that urban growth plan, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10520)|
| 2:55:26| That's the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| That's the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| Can I ask a question about that, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10534)|
| 2:55:37| If the growth plan exists, in the growth plan, if utility services are brought to an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10537)|
| 2:55:48| the density can rise to three, can it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| And this body voted, I think, in January or February to abolish the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10552)|
| 2:55:56| because of these confusing matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| And also, just for clarification purposes, it was an eight-to-five vote at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10560)|
| 2:56:05| Two of the county appointees were not present that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| And when Rebecca Lawnmower came around, when it came around to her after she saw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10568)|
| 2:56:12| well, I don't want to make it even, but it was eight-to-five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10572)|
| 2:56:17| and there was two county appointees that weren't present that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| Commissioner Andrews, you found what you were looking for yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| No, I was wanting to see what was registered, but I can't find it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10583)|
| 2:56:30| Commissioner Bussel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10592)|
| 2:56:33| With this being a growth plan that hasn't been revisited that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| and we've had discussions about that, we're not going to reopen that can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10597)|
| 2:56:45| The arguments that are saying that this is the way it's supposed to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10605)|
| 2:56:52| and if they agree to that now, the individuals out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| does that set a precedence before the MPC for future sales of that property out there in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10616)|
| 2:57:05| Every property, every rezoning is looked at on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| And so I'm not aware that this would set a precedent of any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| Again, every case is considered on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| What I'm saying is if Mr. Davis is denied and you want to keep that as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10636)|
| 2:57:25| and then down the road if you decide another parcel that's close to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10645)|
| 2:57:30| that is basically the same size decides to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| and they want to do it by subdividing to make as their retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10654)|
| 2:57:40| in their property that they have out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| would that, when it came before you all as MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10663)|
| 2:57:49| well, we had this piece of property and we denied because of the growth plan to Mr. Davis here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10669)|
| 2:57:58| then would we not have to deny because it's the same character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| it looks like it's the same character all through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| I can't answer that because every property is looked at on its own merits, its own characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10685)|
| 2:58:10| the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| And in the years, in the future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| the community may decide that they want a different type of growth pattern out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| and that would be weighed as we review those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| And you also may recall that multiple properties just in the last four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| have come before you appealed because MPC denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| So there's a pattern there of which MPC is denying a lot of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| and unfortunately the burden then becomes on to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10713)|
| 2:58:37| because MPC is now consistently denying a lot of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10717)|
| 2:58:42| that you all now have to relook at on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| And I would like to point out that looking at this evening's agenda from MPC as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10726)|
| 2:58:52| every case except this one was recommended for approval by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| typically by a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| This is the only appeal from the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10740)|
| 2:59:04| The appeal last month, that was MPC staff approved, but MPC commission denied, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10744)|
| 2:59:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| And that was dealing with density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10752)|
| 2:59:20| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| Sorry about that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| Clarification, did we vote to do away with the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10765)|
| 2:59:31| Because I sure don't remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| I don't think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| We talked about it, but as the State, we have to go to the State to do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10775)|
| 2:59:41| We were, but we were given an opinion by the law director's office, if you would restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10781)|
| 2:59:49| Our offices opined that the growth plan is no longer effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10789)|
| 2:59:55| And we did not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Mr. Daly, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| I may have misstated that incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| I think the vote was to recommend to the State that they amend or do away with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10800)|
| 3:00:06| We did vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| And you all voted to send that to the State to recommend that they amend or do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10807)|
| 3:00:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| Ms. Pham, did you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10819)|
| 3:00:20| I just wanted to speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| Actually, there's an opinion number 00022 from the Attorney General's office at the State level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10822)|
| 3:00:29| about the effect and enforcement of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| And it highlights two Tennessee codes expressly providing all land use decisions by a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10832)|
| 3:00:37| and its planning commission must be consistent with the countywide growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10837)|
| 3:00:42| It goes on to say inconsistency of a decision with a county growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| might be a ground for a court to overturn the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10845)|
| 3:00:49| The purpose of the growth plan is to direct the coordinated, efficient, and orderly development of the local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10849)|
| 3:00:54| that will, based on the analysis of present and future needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10854)|
| 3:00:57| after a growth plan is approved, all land use decisions made by the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10857)|
| 3:01:01| and the municipality or county commission must be consistent with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10861)|
| 3:01:07| And that comes from the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| And what's the date on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| The date is 2007, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| That's 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10875)|
| 3:01:16| I actually just spoke to several state legislators who are anxious for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10876)|
| 3:01:23| to actually review and revise the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10883)|
| 3:01:27| That's one of the reasons why I asked about the utility expansion, if it allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| even if the growth plan is in place, it allows up to three units to the acre when utilities have been brought to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10891)|
| 3:01:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10896)|
| 3:01:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10897)|
| 3:01:38| What was that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10900)|
| 3:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| As you all know, there's a $40 million to $50 million sewer expansion being done by West Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| We would tie into that sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10914)|
| 3:01:55| Going back to that issue about 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| there was a rule in there that said the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| or the commission body was to revisit that plan growth every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| And it hasn't been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| That kind of is a moot point right there on that other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10930)|
| 3:02:22| You need to come to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| That growth plan, the state mandates that you all are to review it every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10946)|
| 3:02:30| No, it's three committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10950)|
| 3:02:31| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| It's a committee from the town of Farragut, the city of Knoxville, and Knox County, appointed by the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10952)|
| 3:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| But you're a part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| We're not the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| We can't appoint these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10963)|
| 3:02:44| So you're going to put that on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10967)|
| 3:02:48| The mayor has to appoint that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| Still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| The problem that we have with it was since it was never reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10972)|
| 3:02:56| and those mayors were supposed to have initiated that, it has not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| The mayors didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10982)|
| 3:03:04| So, therefore, it's just where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| And we're discussing what we're discussing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| But we're totally off the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| We're off the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| We are off the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| If we could just get back to actually voting, that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10992)|
| 3:03:17| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| Mr. Davis, where is the sewer line at now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| The sewer line is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11004)|
| 3:03:25| If you come up Still Road, there's a division that Saddlebrook did on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| And then Mr. Lowness owns the property up from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| And so sewer can be brought down and tie into the property there where the sewer manhole is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11012)|
| 3:03:37| on the northwest side of the Saddlebrook property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11017)|
| 3:03:41| So it stops now at the top of Sam Lee and Couch Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| It doesn't quite go to Sam Lee and Couch Mill, but it's very, very close, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11025)|
| 3:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11029)|
| 3:03:53| The only holdup is that the property owner, if we deny this tonight, which I have a hesitancy about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11033)|
| 3:04:06| because there's more questions than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| But if we deny this tonight, the landowner, who's not here, is locked in for 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| And that really bothers me that we do that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11053)|
| 3:04:21| The property owner that we're purchasing the property for, they're out of town, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11061)|
| 3:04:27| And I know there's going to be opposition to this, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11067)|
| 3:04:30| But by initiating the sector plan, that's not approving the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| That's not approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11076)|
| 3:04:37| And the sector plan is going to come back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| It will go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| It can come back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| And the second time, if I don't provide all the information, Mr. Sanders can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| But you can deny it once it comes back from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11092)|
| 3:04:53| So all this does is allows the process to move forward, allows us to get all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11093)|
| 3:04:58| And the gentleman that spoke here this evening, that was the first time that I've heard that he owns property all the way down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11098)|
| 3:05:05| Our title company said that that was county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11105)|
| 3:05:10| So there's conflict there, and I'm not by any means stating that what he's saying is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11110)|
| 3:05:16| But there's information there that is conflicting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| So all this would do is allow us to begin the process, send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| It's going to come back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| If we cannot get all that information proven to you between now and the next county commission meeting when this is heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| which will be, what, three months from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| What is the cost of bringing sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| Because if you're three to an acre, you've got to put sewer in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| What's your cost of putting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| You know, until we get approval for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| But, I mean, it's reasonably substantial, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| To bring sewer up through there is pretty expensive, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| Because you'd have to bring it up Couch Mill, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| We can either bring it up through Mr. Lonis' property around that way or up through the right-of-way on Couch Mill, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11154)|
| 3:06:03| This doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| You're willing to expand the road almost half a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11165)|
| 3:06:12| It's 1,200 feet, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| Bring it up to County Code and then run sewer from essentially Hardin Valley Middle School over to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11173)|
| 3:06:20| Well, if you look at the subdivision that's north of Hardin Valley Middle School, the sewer runs almost to Samley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11180)|
| 3:06:27| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| So, I mean, you're still looking at two miles of sewer run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| All tonight I'm requesting is that, again, respect the request to initiate the Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11190)|
| 3:06:37| And by the time this comes back to you all, I don't have all these answers for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11197)|
| 3:06:42| I will stand up before you and request a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| And at least it allows us to initiate the process and move the process forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11206)|
| 3:06:49| Then it becomes incumbent upon us to provide all the unanswered questions for you between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11209)|
| 3:06:56| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| Mr. Davis, clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| You agreed to 2.9 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| 2.95, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11223)|
| 3:07:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11224)|
| 3:07:05| If you bring the sewer to your property according to the growth plan, you won't even need a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11225)|
| 3:07:12| You can put three there already, which is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11234)|
| 3:07:15| We still have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11235)|
| 3:07:16| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| I'll let Mr. Green answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11237)|
| 3:07:18| But as I understand it, we would still, even though you have sewer there, you still have to have it rezoned from ag to PR at whatever units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11238)|
| 3:07:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| With sewer and infrastructure improvements and change of government policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11247)|
| 3:07:32| and all those factors into your justification to be able to amend the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11252)|
| 3:07:38| And so without sewer, without the improvements, we wouldn't be here talking about amending the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11258)|
| 3:07:44| But one of the requirements is utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11267)|
| 3:07:48| To change the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11268)|
| 3:07:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11269)|
| 3:07:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| I just kind of wanted to respond to Commissioner Anders' thoughts about trying to protect the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11275)|
| 3:08:02| from one year of not being able to sell their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11282)|
| 3:08:07| The thing is, if this property owner went into a contract to sell their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11287)|
| 3:08:13| they're going to have to abide by all those terms and conditions of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| one of which is, is if their zoning is not approved, then, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| they're going to lose the right to sell their property, have it rezoned for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11303)|
| 3:08:27| But that's the responsibility of the landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11307)|
| 3:08:30| It should not be the responsibility of the commission that we have to protect somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| from entering into a contract on a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11315)|
| 3:08:40| So to me, it's their fault that they didn't do their due diligence up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11320)|
| 3:08:46| It shouldn't be our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| Well, that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| But also, if somebody that's not read a contract before signs a paper thinking they're going to sell their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| and don't know the implications of that, that's, I mean, that's almost taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11337)|
| 3:09:04| That's a tough deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| Can I add something to Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| You were asking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| From our knowledge, she has two other offers on the table currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| and those other offers would keep the zoning and agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| and allow it to be developed as it is with one house per acre in the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11355)|
| 3:09:21| So if this falls through, she has other offers and other abilities to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| So she's not going to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| So we just wanted to let you guys know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11369)|
| 3:09:38| We don't know if it's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11378)|
| 3:09:43| Ladies and gentlemen, where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11383)|
| 3:09:50| I'll make a motion that we deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11390)|
| 3:09:55| Okay, I'll make a motion that we affirm the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11395)|
| 3:10:00| We affirm the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11400)|
| 3:10:03| Positive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11403)|
| 3:10:04| Don't go down that trail again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11404)|
| 3:10:24| Please restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| You want me to restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11428)|
| 3:10:30| I'll make a motion that we affirm the denial of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| So if you agree that the motion should be denied, you would be voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11433)|
| 3:10:41| Does everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| I apologize, I'm a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11444)|
| 3:10:48| We're voting on the denial, not to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| Okay, so a yes vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| Denies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| Denies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11454)|
| 3:10:55| Denies the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11455)|
| 3:10:56| Denies going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11456)|
| 3:10:57| A no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11457)|
| 3:10:58| Goes to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11458)|
| 3:10:59| No vote because it starts right over, right back where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11459)|
| 3:11:15| You have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| Either you initiate a sector plan amendment and it goes back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11477)|
| 3:11:22| or you deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11482)|
| 3:11:27| If there's six no's, then we're back to where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| Let's not get caught up on whether it's an affirmative or negative motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11490)|
| 3:11:36| The motion, right, and I'll try to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11496)|
| 3:11:43| The motion, it doesn't matter whether the motion is quote unquote affirmative or negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11503)|
| 3:11:49| Where I have tried to advise you, you have to have a motion, a second, and an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11509)|
| 3:11:57| An affirmative vote is a yes vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| That's in favor of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| A motion can be for whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| The opposite of an affirmative vote is a negative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| That means you have more no's than you do yes's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| So the way I understand Mr. Anders' motion is he wants to deny the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11532)|
| 3:12:18| and that would end the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11538)|
| 3:12:20| It wouldn't go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11540)|
| 3:12:22| That's a motion and it can be seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| And if you vote in favor of that, more people vote in favor of it than against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11545)|
| 3:12:30| then that motion carries and the rezoning is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| That's an affirmative vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| Let's not get caught up on whether the motion is affirmative or negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11555)|
| 3:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11559)|
| 3:12:46| State the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| He just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11569)|
| 3:12:50| He said it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| Please clarify again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| A yes vote denies the rezoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11574)|
| 3:13:01| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11581)|
| 3:13:06| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11586)|
| 3:13:08| Do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11588)|
| 3:13:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11594)|

| 3:13:23| How many no's are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11603)|
| 3:13:24| I think it's just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180723?start=11604)|
