| 0:05:27| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Daniel Hsu, 230 East Oklahoma Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration and zoning certificate from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Do you have any planned opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Are you open to a postponement for another month or longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| Well, I went in and got my fingerprinting and all my background check done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| We don't want to put the car before the horse on getting all the inspections done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| We want to make sure that we can get the beer permit before we build out the space completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| So, I mean, it's kind of a situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| There was the two inspections, which are ours, three inspections, which will all, you know, Mr. Hsu has no control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| Sales tax registration, which he does have control over, and then the zoning certificate, which he doesn't have control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| Well, he just has to go to MPC and request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| I mean, it seems pretty minor to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| So, I mean, these are both clearly you've either got them or you don't, and it doesn't get issued until you do, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| Councilman Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Well, I just wanted to ask a question, Ms. Martin, in regard to the distances measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| There's a question mark there, down at the bottom, and a little star, and I was a little confused by the message from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=404)|
| 0:06:53| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| That was resolved last month, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| I thought we talked about that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| We did talk about that, and that's resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I thought last month we thought that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| Well, there were still the question marks, and nothing had been marked through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| So, I just wanted to be sure that that was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| I think they just recopied the same documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| That issue is resolved because if, in fact, there was a church operating there, it was not legally operating there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| and so we have to have a legal operation in order for it to impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| I understand, and thank you very much for answering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Councilman Filo, do you have something further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Sorry, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=461)|

| 0:11:02| and noticed your board is supposed to have two members of city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| it looks like, appointed as ex-officio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| I'm sorry, I don't know who are they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=673)|

| 0:12:12| We're open and task is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Wanda can tell you what our managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| We just got the information that they are still looking for the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| We went through this last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Was it that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| I can't remember the officer's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| I got stage one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| I can't remember the officer's name, but he had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Last time you were at task was February 1st, 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| It wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| The manager's Robert Resmondo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| We took care of that paperwork this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| He's not been to the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| I don't want to disagree with you, but he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| We just need to get us the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| He was the GM of Carrabba's, and his task expires in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| and the other officer verified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| He needs to bring a certificate and give it to Wanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| I'm sorry I disagreed with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Counselor Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Well, it was the old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| I don't know if anyone else would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| I'll leave my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Anyone else want to comment on what we just heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| Ms. Day, could I hear a repeat of what all is missing on this file, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| We're waiting on the sales tax registration, fire inspector approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| and task program certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| And I guess my question would be, you're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Sales tax number is done by my accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I delegate that to the accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| They tell me that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| I would be receiving something in the mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| and I've been waiting patiently from the state on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Well, it looks like we are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| And then the other interesting aspect of this is that you don't have your fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| We've got our certificate occupancy and all that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| I forgot the gentleman's name who did our inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Well, you know, until that reaches the inspections office, that just isn't official with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| And that disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| I had him literally call the what is called beer permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| He was in front of me when he called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| He said, you need to call the beer board to let them know that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| And I said, give me the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| He goes, don't worry about it, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| And he did it right there in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| And Heather with the billing codes, she called the beer board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| Well, I think they expect to see the certification papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Am I correct, Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| We do get phone calls occasionally, but we do need to have something on paper in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| It just concerns me that you're open and yet this information hasn't reached our files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| It concerns me, too, because it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| When did you open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Mr. Swanson, do you want to help me with this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Well, there are two significant issues outstanding, one of which is the fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| And we have many fire inspections where you just have to have the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| If they can procure the document and bring it to them, I don't see any problem at all with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| The other is the task force issue, which you know, and in many cases, in most cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| when task force is not done in that circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| they can postpone to the following meeting and ask them to get the task force done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Here we have an issue about whether it's been done or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| And it sounds to me as though there's just a little misunderstanding with regard to the fact that they need to get the certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| showing that it was completed in September of last year to somebody because it's good for a year, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| So if they get that documentation, then I don't see that that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| I would not want you to adopt a motion authorizing the permit without having the final documentation produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| But I'm not concerned about the fact that the documentation can be produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| And if it's not, then they don't get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Can we set a date certain on which that documentation has to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| under the circumstances of the disagreement about whether or not these are in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| Well, if they don't produce it, they're never going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| So let's see what you accomplish with a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Well, I see you're extremely amused, but you have a very difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| And that's in my district, and I feel, you know, very responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| Consequently, I'd like for you to take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| So I think where I was going, I was hoping that we could possibly do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| is to say that that needs to be produced by this Friday or he will have to come before us again in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1019)|
| 0:17:08| Can that amendment be added to a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| If I can get support for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| I see no impediment to making a motion of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| I move approval of this application with the condition that this certification, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| is complete and in the Bureau of Permitting office prior to Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| If it is not, then it is my motion that you will have to close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| until you have been able to produce that a month from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I don't think you can make them close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| They can't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| I'm sorry, can't sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| We're selling a lot of Fuse now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| You're selling what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Fuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| It's a banana drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| It's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| We're not selling any beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Well, I should have asked you that question before I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| What are you selling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Coca-Cola and tea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| And something bananas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Yes, Fuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| It's a banana drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Well, you know, I won't be in to check on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| but I'm really troubled by, you know, you not realizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| you were here last month and not realizing how important this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| My account told me the sales tax number is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| What's the other, so I can call him in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| That's you in the state attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| The officer said that I'm good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Remember that last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| He was a Kingsport officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| He was from Kingsport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| He was an officer that did your records or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| He does the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| He did mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Officer McNutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| McNutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| McNutt said I'm good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| And he had Robert Resmondo's records in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And that's where I left the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| I guess I need to see if there's a second to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Yes, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Mike, is that your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| What do you think about what you just heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Well, I thought I was going to give about a 30-second presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| To be blunt, I thought I was going to give about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| No, I mean about the proposal that if you have it in there by Friday, you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Oh, it just sounds to me like I need to make a few phone calls to support the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| And it should be a very simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| I think Mr. Swanson said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| And there's a misunderstanding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| And you're not going to get your permit until the final documentation is all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I'm not asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Let me just finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| But if you want to go along with what Councilman Pelo just proposed, then I'll go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| I don't want to close me down, but I'm not about to sell beer without all the good things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| I misstated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| But I understand your situation, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Do you understand what I'm asking you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| I mean, it sounds like I just need to make some phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Well, listen, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| If you get your documentation, I mean, if you get all the fire inspection, the task certification, if you turn that in by this Friday, you get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| That's all I can ask you for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| That's fine? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I don't want any special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| The papers need to be up here in the City-County Building Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| And I'll communicate with Wanda, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| We have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Sorry, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| No, Barbara, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| I'm not wanting special privileges or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| You're getting special privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I don't think you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| I just want to make sure that I understand the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| The motion is that it be approved subject to final documentation as long as the documentation is produced to our office by Friday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1232)|
| 0:20:44| And if it is not, then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| It goes to the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And he does not receive a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| So it's denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| And I said it would be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| He would have to come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Denied so that then he would have to start the process again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| I just want to make sure I understand what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Well, if the State of Tennessee hasn't processed the mail for my tax number, I don't even know what I'm supposed to do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1266)|
| 0:21:16| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I think Councilman Becker was ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| I guess I share some of Joe's concerns and Councilman Bailey's, sorry, about, I mean, it feels like on the tax certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| there's a piece of paper out there that he needs to get in, and that feels like that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| The inspections seem like they can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| I'm actually worried about the sales tax, that he's waiting on a bureaucrat in Nashville to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| and I would hate to deny his application because a Nashville bureaucrat took a day off today because it was nice and didn't get something in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| So I'd be inclined to say let's do the motion the way we usually do, approval pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| and if it takes him, you know, a week to get it in, you know, we do that many a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| I understand that, and normally people are very serious about this and very involved personally in getting it taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| My concern is I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Trust me, I'm very serious about my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Well, I withdraw that phrase from the motion I made in regard to everything being there by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1337)|
| 0:22:28| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| If I were you, I would be there before Friday with everything that you can produce, and we know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1349)|
| 0:22:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| So it's my second move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| So the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| I presume the person who seconded it would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1381)|
| 0:23:11| Roya Albar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Roya Albar, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| Could you give us your name and address, please, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Tina Salazar, 3101 Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Wait just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1408)|

| 0:23:50| Oh, you want me to go ahead and wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| I was with you, Steve, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1435)|

| 0:24:04| Ms. Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| We're waiting on the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| approval from the building inspector, fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| Councilman Pelo, is that in your lap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| No, but this is my district, so I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| When are you planning to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| It's currently open under another individual's beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| so we're looking to transfer the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Are you serving beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| It's under his beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| It's a currently operating business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| It's been there for 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Little Ricky's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| To close out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Why are these so difficult tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| When is the closeout to occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Well, it was pending, of course, on the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Pending the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Right, so nothing's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| But you don't have all of your certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Everything has been done, and I have the documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| except I've met with the three inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| and there is a few maintenance items to be tidied up before those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| can be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| So I do not have those approvals today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| I've met with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| and there needs to be just a couple of small items that need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| done still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Well, I would move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1523)|

| 0:25:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1530)|

| 0:26:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Just one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| You understand you can't start selling beer until you get that final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| documentation in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1586)|

| 0:26:51| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| The manager has not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Waiting on a building inspector's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| We have someone signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Reverend Bolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| You can come to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| I'm the Reverend Michelle Warner Bolt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| chaplain of Tyson House Episcopal Lutheran Campus Ministry at 824 Melrose Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| I'm here today to state one thing only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| and that is that Tyson House Episcopal Lutheran Campus Ministry is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And you will have before you the documentation that I have produced on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| including the definition of a church and how we meet said definition as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| body of Christians that meets there to worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Council Member Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| We, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| postponed this issue at our last fair word meeting because there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| discussion as to whether or not the Tyson House was functioning as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| So I contacted Reverend Bolt and asked her to provide some substantiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| for the beer board so that that would be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| And I believe under the measurement of distances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Officer Husky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| this business is too close for an on-premise permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| I'm not sure what the distance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Our packet says it's 131 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| So I don't know whether the Councilman for this district wants to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| this as a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| As you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| we have a couple of options here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Council Member Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| In response to Council Member Roddy's question as to whether or not I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| to address it as a postponement or take another option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| it seems to me like it's fairly clear cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| If this is indeed a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| and it appears it is by the definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| at least the dictionary definition that's been provided to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| and it's probably an acceptable definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| then I don't know what further debate would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1743)|
| 0:29:10| Mr. Swanson, do you want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Well, there is an alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| and the alternative would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| as in the last time when this particular area had a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| an alternative is that the applicant could ask you to postpone it for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| period of time and determine whether or not they could seek an ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| If they get an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| our distance requirements are not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Okay, good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| We can't postpone it until such point or we can deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| I guess the applicant wishes for you to postpone and whether you wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| accede to that wish or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Actually, we would, because that's what we're going after right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1788)|
| 0:29:58| Councilman Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Are you finished, Councilman Huntquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| For the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| I don't know whether Councilman Bailey or Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| I spoke with Reverend Bolt this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| and I don't know whether she wants to address this further from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I think, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| the location of the Tyson House is within striking distance of many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| neighbors that serve alcoholic beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| and I think the congregation there is realistic of their placement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| perhaps even sees that as an opportunity for outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| So I don't think anybody is here to set up enemies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| However, we do have rules that we have to operate under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and Reverend Bolt, do you want to say anything further about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Our primary concern is that we are acknowledged as a church body by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| laws of this state and under this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| And so that is our number one concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| is to register that we indeed are a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| And other than that, we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Historically, as permits have come before this body in years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| and I think they predate any of us here on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| decisions have been made that were not reflective of the Tyson House being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| recognized as a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| And so I think Reverend Bolt and I, personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| certainly are comfortable with going ahead with a postponement scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| as long as this board recognizes on the record that this establishment is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| church and does function as a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| In terms of other permits, for example, off-premise permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| there is not, if that business is only asking to serve beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| there's not kind of the end-run scenario with the 50-foot distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| I would defer to my esteemed colleague, because he had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| Is there an esteemed colleague around here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Sitting right next to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| On either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Well, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| I mean, it sounds like everybody else is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| so I'll make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| The question is how long will that postponement need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| We just now started the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| so I don't know how long that's going to take, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| I'll postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I'll make a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| meeting, and then we'll see what's transpired in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Councilman Bailey, I didn't mean to neglect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| That was my question, is how long did you want to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| That won't be long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=1959)|

| 0:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Is anyone here from the university?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Who are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Just, you know, we received late this afternoon an email from the head of the UT Faculty Senate, you know, concerned about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2060)|
| 0:34:34| I mean, I'm certainly, you know, concerned about it, too, and understand that I've talked to Mr. Swanson that a postponement might be viable to find out some more about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2074)|
| 0:34:46| So the Faculty Senate could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| And what they've asked, have you all given any thought to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| To postponing our permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| I think that in talking with some of the administrators, that we don't feel that the Sodexo should be penalized for, if their application is complete, that that's an internal situation that the Chancellor will address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2102)|
| 0:35:18| The Chancellor's come out in support of the application, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| In thinking about this situation, because it is a, you know, it's a unique situation where a university contract body is trying, a body that contracts with the university is trying to get a beer permit for a campus that's supposed to be dry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2125)|
| 0:35:40| and it's in an athletic facility that you can't serve for games, and you have a lot of, you know, I'd say the bulk of the university's students are underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2140)|
| 0:35:52| And, you know, I've had a great conversation with Mr. Boyd about this situation, about half an hour conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| You know, we can't do anything with the force of law or make a beer permit contingent, but I would suggest that you all consider, because the story, you know, this is about the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2159)|
| 0:36:17| It's not, you know, the bottom line for the university, but there's more to be concerned about than just the bottom line, that a portion of these proceeds, you know, I have a couple of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2177)|
| 0:36:29| First, a portion of the proceeds go to the student population for alcohol abuse awareness classes, considering that this is at a university facility, and also since this is going to be a significant piece of revenue, you know, $450,000, $500,000 to the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2189)|
| 0:36:50| that maybe you all consider dedicating a portion of it, 10%, 15%, 20%, to need-based scholarships for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2210)|
| 0:36:59| It's just a thought of a couple of things that, you know, the university could do besides enhancing the bottom line to also help out the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2219)|
| 0:37:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I didn't get the email today, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Could you tell me a little bit about it, what the rationale for the faculty senate, what their reason for postponement is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2234)|
| 0:37:23| Well, I believe they were just flat out asking for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| It was, if you'd seen today's News Sentinel, it likewise was discussed there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| I guess, you know, I don't have the article nor their resolution in front of me, but it came in around 3.30, 4 o'clock this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2254)|
| 0:37:43| What was the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| I guess they were talking about the money, you know, with an underage, predominantly underage student population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2266)|
| 0:37:55| and they might take some exceptions to the athletic department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| Let me ask you guys a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| What percentage of venues would you say are predominantly for students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2284)|
| 0:38:13| Could you give us the nature of the venues and who the attendees are for the events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| For our events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| For most of the events that Sodexo is applying license for, I mean, you're talking about concerts that probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2301)|
| 0:38:31| and don't hold me to this number, but I'm saying probably maybe 10 percent are students and the rest of them are probably general population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2311)|
| 0:38:41| That alcohol would be sold, beer would be sold at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Well, at special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| It might be a 10 percent student population, maybe less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Mr. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Sodexo, do you operate any other venues wherein you provide a beer for functions and activities like you're asking to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2339)|
| 0:39:09| Some other venues that Sodexo operates under similar size arenas and would serve beer at similar events would be Ohio State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2349)|
| 0:39:18| the Schottenstein Center on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin, the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| and UConn University or the University of Connecticut and Arizona State University in Arizona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| Let me ask you, and I see this document here, and I don't have time to go through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| and I think we got a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Can you tell me in a nutshell what your serving policy and procedures are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| In that packet of information that I gave you, we have the Sodexo corporate alcohol policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| I have put together an alcohol service policy for Thompson Bowling Arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| and we are going to only sell alcohol or beer at designated locations within the arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| and they're going to be the two concession stands that are located directly behind the stage where we normally don't open for concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| So it's going to be limited locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| We're going to set up ID stations where everybody who wants to purchase alcohol in Thompson Bowling Arena is going to be required to be ID'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2413)|
| 0:40:22| Regardless of how their appearance, everybody's going to be required to show a valid driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| That's the only form ID that we're going to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| We're going to purchase ID scanners that will actually scan the barcode on the back of the driver's licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| You can fake the information on the front of the IDs, but it's next to impossible to fake the barcodes on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Once they have had their identification scanned, the scanners will say over 21, under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2444)|
| 0:40:52| We will actually put a colored wristband on one of their wrists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| If you do not have a wristband, you do not get served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| We are going to line them up kind of like a teller window at a bank, one person at a time going up to the counter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| and we'll have somebody there monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| Once somebody gets their beer, which is one beer per customer per visit, they'll leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| and then we'll see next, and the next person can walk up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| So it's just not a mass hit to the concession stand, and we can control it a little bit better that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| We're going to instruct the individuals in our concession stands who are selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| if a person is walking up and actually has a wristband and they question the person's age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| they will be ID'd again for a second time just for verification to make sure we're not selling underage individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| We're going to work closely with Tim Reese and the campus police department to establish cutoff times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| and they're normally, say, 15 minutes after the main act starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| we will cut off the beer sales in the arena and won't offer it for sale anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| We're going to have a designated driver program for the people who might need that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2518)|
| 0:42:07| We've contacted the local cab companies in the area and worked out predetermined fares at discounted rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2527)|
| 0:42:15| for somebody who we feel might need a ride home that's not safe to get behind the wheel of a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| We've also set up alternative lodging at Holiday Inn here at the World's Fairgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| They've agreed to give us a discounted rate for a patron who might be traveling to Nashville that won't be able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2548)|
| 0:42:38| We can put them up in a hotel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| We have a designated driver program for people who come up in a group of individuals that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| one's going to be a designated driver for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| We're going to issue them a different colored wristband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| and that will enable them to get free non-alcoholic beverages at our concession stands throughout the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2570)|
| 0:43:00| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I can keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Actually, you started answering a lot of my questions that I had, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| Mr. Swanson, we've got a complete packet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Let me go back to you before I go to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| Councilman Frost asked a question earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| While I don't think we may have the jurisdiction to require you to do some of the things he suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| in any of the other college venues that you're operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| do you have any types of programs where you donate part of your proceeds back to a scholarship fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| or to a program that would assist in education and outreach for issues of consuming alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| and if so, have those been implemented, and would you consider implementing the same here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| I'm not aware of that in any of the universities, but then again, that's a contractual with each university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| so I'd have to check with each location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Is that something you guys would be amenable to talking with the university about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Pursuing, provided that everybody's in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I think it's a good suggestion from Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| I don't think that we can require it as part of a beer permit if we ultimately grant one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| but I do think that if you guys say and give us your word that you're willing to explore that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| and Mr. Rees is here also, that that would be a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| You may even work with Ms. Brunson down at the Metropolitan Drug and Alcohol Commission about some of the things that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| and how they could maybe have a part in what you're doing in helping with education and outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| I just think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Are you guys willing to engage in a meeting with her if she'll set that up at the Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Mr. Swanson, with a complete packet like this, and I hate to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| but I think we all know the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Some of the concerns that have been brought up thus far, are they a basis for denying a beer permit at this juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2690)|
| 0:45:01| I really have heard nothing presented so far that would serve as a basis for denial of a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| A beer permit is an administrative quasi-judicial proceeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| and you have certain standards that you have to determine whether they meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| or whether they don't meet the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And if the standards are met, then there is an entitlement to that procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| The thing that I heard mentioned was a postponement rather than a denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| and certainly it is within your jurisdiction to determine whether or not you need a postponement for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| In view of the sort of uniqueness of this particular permit application, you might want further review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| but that's entirely within the discretion and jurisdiction of this Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Have you guys been contacted at all by anyone from the Senate there at the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| or anyone who has concerns, or the Faculty Senate there with regards to sitting down and meeting with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| I have not been contacted directly, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| How about indirectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| No, just what I've read in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| I've had, you know, through this whole process, we've been working closely with the Athletic Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| Jeff Maples of the Chancellor of the University, you know, we're here because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| they asked us to, you know, move forward with this, the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| So, you know, we've had, you know, all along, you know, we're in this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| and, you know, if, you know, there's an event come to the arena, they say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| we don't want to, you know, we probably shouldn't sell alcohol or beer at the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| We're not going to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| You know, if there's a, you know, a family-friendly show, you know, we'll use Hannah Montana as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| We would not have sold beer at the Hannah Montana concert because of the age demographic in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Councilman Woodhall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| You were contacted by the Athletic Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| So I have no quarrel with the fact that the process was initiated through the Athletic Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and you have done a good job of putting together a packet and describing very thorough procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| and I have no question that you're going to do things in a responsible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| But in my mind, the issue is the fact that the university seems to be having an internal dialogue that is persisting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| and having a faculty president of the UT Senate request a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| I didn't hear or read the article about them wanting a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| But if they're wanting a postponement so they can continue to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| it seems very legitimate to postpone this until the next meeting to allow them to continue to have their internal dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2851)|
| 0:47:42| Would a postponement interfere with your process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| I think that the Chancellor has, again, I reflect back to the Chancellor has kind of said grace over this entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2868)|
| 0:47:59| and he has in turn contacted his folks administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| For example, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs was contacted in terms of the impact on the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| and I think that within the university, those are things that can be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| but I'm not sure that a postponement is a situation that we need to put Sodexo in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2897)|
| 0:48:28| I mean, they have their stuff in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| And I think that the Chancellor, he's not in town right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| He's on vacation, or he would have addressed this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| I still favor a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| The part of the packet that I gave you, there is a letter from the Chancellor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| giving us or authorizing us to move forward with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Actually, at least two of us have not gotten the packet at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| You don't have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| It was on our desks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| It was on our desks when we sat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| We didn't get it ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| Charles took it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I just want to clarify something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Have they asked for a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Or asked for a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| A denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| They asked for a denial, not a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Who asked for a denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Well, that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Dr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Who asked for the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| We're throwing that around pretty freely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| As I was walking out the door, if I can comment, I went to turn off my e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| and when I did, I noticed that there was there an e-mail from Dr. Patterson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| who I believe is the President of the Faculty Senate, if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| And in that e-mail, he asked for a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I also had another e-mail today from another individual, and I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| but I didn't bring it with me so I don't recall, and that was also a request for a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| I had several other e-mails from individuals who asked for strong consideration of the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| and I expressed some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| So that was my personal experience today with hearing from either university personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| or people who had strong feelings about the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| When I get a chance, I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| Councilman Pelow, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| I've had my light on, but I don't know if Councilman Holquist was in front of me or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you for yielding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| I do want the mic back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| I promise I won't take your microphone away from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| Well, this is in my district also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| and I tend to agree with some of the concerns that I've heard from my fellow council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| I'm very concerned about what the Faculty Senate, the issues that they're raising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| It does not appear that we have the authority, as Mr. Swanson said, to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| certainly not based on the information we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Given the circumstances and given the unique nature of the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| and having heard what my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| I'm going to make a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Any discussion on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Yes, I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Well, I'd like to make my comments, and we haven't had an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Ms. Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Do you have an event in the next 30 days that this permit would affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| We have Hank Williams, Jr. and Leonard Skinner on May 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| And you would anticipate that you might want to serve beer at those events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| I'm not comfortable approving this permit tonight because one of the stipulations that I asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| when you and I spoke on the phone was the one beer per person rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and Councilman Frost and I were not provided with these booklets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| I did borrow one from Councilman Woodhall a moment ago and flipped through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| and saw that you had included that, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| However, not having had this provided before tonight, I need adequate time to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| I also would be more comfortable with this permit if you would take the opportunity during a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| to meet with Ms. Brunson from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| She is here tonight, and we could check with her if that's acceptable to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| She could go through this booklet with you and assure us that if this permit is approved by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| that every possible step has been taken not only to address the issue of underage drinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| but also the issue of over-serving, which I think is equally important in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| So I support the postponement and would like to postpone with a caveat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| that a meeting take place between now and the next meeting of the Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| with Ms. Brunson from the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| Councilwoman Poulok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| I had planned to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| Most of those have been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| We had a very long conversation by phone, and I appreciated that because I had a number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| Some of those I see are well answered here, and Vice Mayor Brown inquired and got the answers to some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3188)|
| 0:53:17| One thing we discussed, and I don't know if it is included in your procedures and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| but I was concerned about this is going to be an on-premise permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| My concern was what is to ‚Äì I don't believe I asked for the one-drink policy, but we did discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3210)|
| 0:53:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| And you indicated to me that would not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| I didn't argue that point, but I had a concern about those who had drinks that they might be taking from the arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3226)|
| 0:53:55| and I was very concerned about that because this is an on-premise policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| and I did not see any way that you had definitely planned to prevent that from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| Well, after ‚Äì it was our intention that after, you know, appearing before you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| we were going to have a meeting set up with Mr. Maples, myself, and members of the University Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| to go over the policies and procedures if we catch somebody in the arena drinking under the age of 21 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3259)|
| 0:54:27| What's the policy going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| There's going to be a written policy in place, and we'll add that to the Thompson Bowling Arena alcohol service policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| You know, if you're caught under the age of 21, this is what's going to happen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| The person who gave it to you, this is going to be the consequences for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| and we are also going to have people stationed or posted at the exit to the arena to make sure people are not leaving the arena with open containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| Is that incorporated into the verbiage here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| It is not because we have not had that meeting yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| Well, we discussed that when you and I talked, and frankly, I was pleased to see that this is a rather complete-looking document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3297)|
| 0:55:07| I'm not a drinker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I think everybody in Knoxville knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I've said that so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| On the other hand, I realize that we, as a city, do support events that do serve beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3314)|
| 0:55:23| and I feel an obligation to allow those permits, and we do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| So I have a problem making a difference with a concert which might occur there than a concert which occurs at the Coliseum or Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3331)|
| 0:55:43| So this is a huge dilemma for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| I think this morning in trying to eat breakfast in my little bowl of Cheerios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| and seeing there that we had this discourse going on between the Faculty Senate and the possibility of this permit being allowed really disturbed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3353)|
| 0:56:06| I'm just so disappointed that this discussion has not taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| If it needed to take place, and I don't know who should have initiated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| but I really think it should have been initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| and I don't think the City Council of Knoxville should have been put in the middle between these two groups that have opposing views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| and I think that should have been something worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| So I'm sure you all feel quite in the middle of all that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| So given the publicity that was given to it this morning and given the e-mails we've received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3394)|
| 0:56:48| it seems that it really requires of us giving you an opportunity to resolve some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| and allowing the two parties to resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| Now, in terms of the concert, which you had hoped to be able to serve the beer for the Leonard Skinner concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3418)|
| 0:57:07| that troubles me a bit that you would miss that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| But on the other hand, I simply feel that we have really been put in a situation which none of us want to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3432)|
| 0:57:23| and I have to congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| When we talked, very good answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| I see them embodied here mostly from what I've been able to flip through and am pleased with your policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| I think you've got, as we discussed, I think you've got enormous challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| And that business of someone taking drinks from the arena really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3462)|
| 0:57:52| So, and I didn't see that incorporated into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| So I've got to suddenly make a decision here on how to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| But I really am so very disappointed in the university not recognizing that there might need to be groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| they needed to clear the plan with before it came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| Mr. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Let me also say for the record, the alcohol procedures and policy manual that's in front of me that I have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| I don't think anybody got it before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I think it was actually sitting here with a packet of our stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| And I don't want to be inferred that maybe some of us had this for a period of time and others didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| It was sitting here at the desk, and I haven't had a chance to look at it, as I alluded to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| That's why I ask you those specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Let me also ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| In light of the fact that we have a complete packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| this council in the past has made certain, not concessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| but made certain judgments with regards to when we will hear an issue again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| when we have an individual who does have either a business start-up date coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| or some sort of issue that they will be precluded from participating in because we postponed them to the next spirit board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| So I wanted to ask the maker of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| if it is possible that we move this and have a special call spirit board meeting before our next council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| which would be May 6th, that gives them two weeks to have these meetings, to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| We'll have it by May 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| And if it is approved then, then they can still engage in their activities on, what did you say, May 9th or 10th or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| And I'd like to offer that as an amendment to the motion that we actually have a special call meeting before our next council meeting on May 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| that you guys go forward, do the things that were alluded to earlier by Council Member Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| in addition to maybe exploring some of the other opportunities we talked about, and then we get back together then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| So I'd like to make that as a friendly amendment, hopefully, to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| so that we can then get back to the issue very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| but also allow you an opportunity, if it's possible, to move forward with your venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Are you asking if I'll accept it as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| I think that was the spirit it was offered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| That was the spirit it was offered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Well, I'm not sure if two weeks is enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| I think the concern has been stated, you know, in terms of adequate dialogue, both with the Faculty Senate and also with Ms. Brunson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3615)|
| 1:00:25| can that be, can all that happen in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| And I don't know if it can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Well, I mean, if they report back that they haven't been able to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| then we go on with our council meeting and we push it back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| But I think that they don't have to go out and gather any more documentation, do any more fingerprinting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| They're getting scanner cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| They're ready to go just having a couple of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| So I would anticipate they might be able to do that and then update this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| But I want to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| But, I mean, I'm making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| And if it's a position that the council doesn't feel that that's a good motion or turns it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| I'm just not very comfortable pushing it off 30 days since we're so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| And I think ultimately we're in a position that we're an administrative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| And I don't know if we're going to be able to come back ultimately and say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| So why prolong something 30 days when we can press this issue and compress this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| and say do it in two weeks, not 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Well, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Again, my concern is whether or not the conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| and dialogue that should happen can happen in that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| But I will accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| And you guys do understand if these meetings don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| and we're going to ask you about them at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| If it doesn't occur in the next two weeks, it doesn't mean that this is going to get voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| It will get postponed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| You understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| I'll make sure we're very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| So you shouldn't be dilatory about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Are there any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| So we're voting on a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| No, we're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| The amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| Chairman Hall, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| He accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| He accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Do you have another one of these booklets that you could provide to Ms. Brunson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| She's here this evening so that she could review that in anticipation of your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Then I won't give her mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Mr. Chairman, I accept it as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| We're just voting on the postponement for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| which would also embody in the call for a special beer board meeting prior to the City Council meeting two weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| And I thank the Councilman from the First District for accepting the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| That was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3750)|

| 1:03:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Are you also operating the establishment that's on South Parkside Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| South Parkside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Is this Soho's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Our first Soho is in Western Plaza, across from Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Even though we're not legally allowed to consider them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| you've got some serious violations reflected in city court, fire code violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| Are those going to be taken care of and not happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| The Soho, the concept is strictly a restaurant and bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| I think the fire code violations was from the Cumberland location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| and that was a nightclub and a bar and restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| But, I mean, it was having locked fire exits, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| It was the back fire door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| It was the Cumberland location, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| The fire door was locked, and they require us to have a key on there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| That was the issue on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| But you're certain that won't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| It's the location, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Councilman Hopkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| That is my concern, too, as long as we're clear that that cannot happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| Because even at a club, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| people have been burned to death in clubs that have had locked doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| both in this country and overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3884)|

| 1:06:10| we postpone to the next beer board meeting, as we've done earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080422?start=3970)|
