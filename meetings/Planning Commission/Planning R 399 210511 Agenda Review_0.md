| 0:00:47| Before we get in and before I turn this over to Amy, I want to recognize our newest member on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:54| representing Knox County, appointed by Mayor Jacobs, Jim Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=54)|

| 0:01:07| You can use that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| My name is Jim Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| I'm a realtor, been in Knoxville since 78 and been in real estate since 87 in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| And, of course, I'm filling an expired term, an unexpired term for a past commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:34| Looking forward to serving and I see a couple of folks around the room that I know and going to have a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| They tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| For some of our new members, we've got like three or four present that have not attended a regular in-session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:51| Everything's been virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| So, you know, I want to remind everyone when we come into the meeting on Thursday that in order to speak or be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:02:03| be recognized by chair, there's a red button at your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| And, you know, press the red button and the light in front of you will turn on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| And at that point, I will recognize you and you'll be able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| Also, one more thing I want to mention, you know, wear your mask during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| If you if you're comfortable taking it off at your place, at your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| He had mentioned to me that PBA does require masks in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| But as you can see, it's kind of difficult to eat and wear a mask at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| But if you do get out and walk around during the meeting or break, please put your mask on during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=163)|
| 0:02:54| Talk to Commissioner Graf a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| He had requested my input on doing a meet and greet since we have a number of new commissioners that have really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:06| This is the first time y'all been in in session together other than virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| So Dick has offered his home for a meet and greet event in the evening sometime, probably the first week of June or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:20| And I wanted to see what what the interest there from commissioners, if you would be able to attend, probably on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| You think Friday, Saturday, maybe Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| So is there anybody have any thoughts you want to raise your hand if you all would be interested in doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| It's not a not sanctioned by the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| It's just a little opportunity for everybody to get together and meet each other for the first time outside a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| So everybody pretty much favor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| I'll work with Dick and get some information out to you here in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| I also want to remind those who are new to us and for those of us who have been around for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:10| that after our regular meetings, we do gather socially, usually at Clancy's following the meeting for some light refreshments and discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:22| We don't talk about items that we're going to be on for next month or the preceding months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| We kind of leave those outside of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| But we do have an opportunity to engage with one another and, again, get to know each other a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| Gerald Green, our former executive director, will be attending Thursday's meeting briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| and then joining those who would like to be down at Clancy's following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| So if you want to see Gerald, he'll be at Clancy's following the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| I'll turn it over to Director Brooks, and she'll, again, introduce our newest member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| But our new attorney representing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| And I'll let her make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Can everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| I have a few announcements before I turn it over to our speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=312)|

| 0:06:54| in particular me as I've served in the interim executive director role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=414)|

| 0:07:18| but the Knox County Schools enrollment projections, we have a hand in those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| and he's been involved in that as well as some addressing work, urbanized area analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| and he's been helping out with plaque closures while we've had someone on maternity leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| All of our planning staff are working on site for a minimum of three days a week now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=453)|

| 0:07:49| And as you all know, Mr. Wise's last month with us is this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| He served as the attorney for planning for at least 34 years that we've been able to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| He can correct me if I'm wrong about that date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| but we're really going to miss his wealth of institutional knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| and we're grateful for all of his years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| So thank you, Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| Are you going to make a speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| Mr. Wise also introduced us to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| He introduced Tasha Blakeney, so we're very happy to have her on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| She's officially joining us on June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| She's going to be our new attorney, and so please take time and welcome her to our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| And finally, our planning commission workshop or retreat that I was trying to schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| you haven't heard from me because I've had a difficult time getting that time nailed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| So we're going to push that out just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| I think it makes sense we have another new commissioner coming on board to fill out Gail Buston's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| And so Amy Midas will join us, so we'll have – you'll hear from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| We'll have something up in June or July for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=547)|

| 0:09:43| and implementing the city's urban forest management plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Casey's going to share a little bit more about his role as an urban forester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and highlight some of the successes since the city created this new role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| My understanding is you are the first one to have ever filled it, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| And he will provide us with a high-level overview of the city's tree ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Can you guys hear me all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Well, Casey Krause, urban forester with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Been here for about, oh, man, nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| I think I'm going on ten right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Hard to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Come from the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| And we've spent our vast majority of the time the last ten years trying to tackle a lot of low-hanging fruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:25| a lot of issues, maintenance things like that that we try to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| And I'll share a couple of those slides with you guys here in just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| And now we're starting to look at big picture, long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| and kind of look at what we envision Knoxville looking like in the next 30, 50, 100 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| So my role with the city of Knoxville, I put myself in five different categories you see up there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| And first and foremost is public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| A lot of people ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| I'm not a police officer or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| We have trees, and we have about 40% tree cover, actually 38% now, tree cover across the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| Anytime you have trees in and around people, buildings, infrastructure, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| there are safety components associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| So I'm a certified tree risk assessor, so I often find myself going out, customer complaints or concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| things like that, going out there, assessing trees for their health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| and making sure that nobody's going to get hurt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| taking care of any safety-related issues that trees may potentially pose to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| Expansion of urban tree canopy, that's kind of our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| We want more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| The more tree cover we have, the more benefits we get from trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| I don't have a lot of slides on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| but essentially we know that environmental benefits, social benefits, economic benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=700)|
| 0:11:50| all of those things are directly correlated to the more trees we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| the more impacts that trees are going to make on those different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| Expansion of urban tree canopy is just a fancy word of me saying tree planting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| trying to put more trees into the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| And we've done a tremendous amount of tree planting in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| We do about 600 to 700 trees just with my budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| but on top of that we have all of our city projects as well that go on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| capital projects like streetscapes, Cumberland Avenue, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| Protection of public trees is essentially my—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| I have to oversee the tree protection ordinance for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| and then the maintenance of public trees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I have a staff of seven folks that I oversee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Those are the guys that you see out in the bucket trucks, the watering trucks, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| They're actually doing the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| I don't have—you can probably see all the brush trucks that go around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| That doesn't fall under my umbrella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| but I do have some purview over some of what they do on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| And then the last thing is education like I'm doing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| First time I got to do this in public in about a year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| so it's nice to be here and not over Zoom for once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| A couple of pictures up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| We've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| We've done a lot with our sidewalk replacement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| It used to be go in there and put the sidewalks in as fast as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| and who cares where the tree roots are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| and now we're really taking a different look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| We go in proactively, look at the trees, where they're going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| and making sure we're trying to avoid trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| There's a lot of infrastructure in there to try and minimize conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| with hardscapes like tree roots and concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| and there's a lot of other things that we can do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| That picture on the bottom left, tree grates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| That's another issue that we try to start moving away from tree grates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| and things like that, but try and just plan accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Allow the trees to have the space they need in order to incorporate the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| that they're going to be growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Tree grates are great if you're going to have a tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| that's only going to reach 10 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| However, we want more tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| We want trees to be 25, 40, 50 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| It doesn't work very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| You'll see around downtown we're starting to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| the amount of space available for trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| and it really goes to underground space, not above ground space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| So you'll see us starting to expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Mulching was a big thing that we took over as far as maintenance goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| People used to see the old volcano mulches all over town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| and we tackled those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Copper pruning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Those were the small or the low-hanging fruits that we tackled early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| and we've seen huge improvements of where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| as far as a huge reduction on our mortality as far as tree planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| We have less than 1% tree mortality per year as far as our public trees go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| On top of that, we respond to all the storm calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| Just this Sunday, while everyone is enjoying Mother's Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| we were out moving trees from roadsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| and making sure that everyone could get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| and get to where they needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| So we take care of all of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| We have a Tree City USA program that we implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| So pretty much anything tree-related under the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| falls under my purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| Just a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| We have about 30,000 public trees across the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| and about 1,000 miles of streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| and that's where the majority of our work falls is along streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| Again, talking about we have 40% – I always say 40%, we're now at 38% –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| 38% tree cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| That's trees all along streets and corridors and places like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| that we have to manage as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Limbs growing into the streets, stop signs, dead trees growing next to roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| sidewalks, stuff like that that we have to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Big picture, species diversity has been a big part of what we've been trying to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| I used to go in there and plant maples, and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| We try and diversify as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| You can see that table there kind of gives you an idea of diversification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| The importance of that is I come from an area, Fort Wayne, Indiana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| where right before I left we lost almost 40% of our entire tree population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| because they were so heavily planted in ash trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Us here in Knoxville, we're sitting really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| We don't have any trees over 7%, and that's the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| We want to diversify ourselves as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| because we don't know what the next little bug or critter that's going to come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| and start making devastating impacts on our tree population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| So that's one of the goals that we try and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| Tree maintenance, we put ourselves into a two-, a five-,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| and a seven-year cyclical maintenance program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| So we do different things at those periods of time after the tree's been planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| So at two years, we go in and we do an initial structure prune,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| making sure that the trees are properly pruned because it's huge advantageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| as far as where that tree might be 10 years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| if we go in and prune it at a young age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Every five years, so on a five-year basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| every tree gets pruned or maintained in some capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| We have the city broken apart in north, south, east, and west, and then central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| And each year we move to another area and start doing maintenance in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Every seven years, at a seven-year basis after the trees have been in the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| we reestablish, we check the tree for its root system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| reestablish the mulch rings in and around those trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| and then also make sure that the structure of the tree is pruned properly again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| for the second structure prune that we do in that tree's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| And after that, seven years, the trees fall into that cyclical pruning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| And then urban tree canopy assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| That's something that we are working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| We partnered with Knox County, the Trees Knoxville, the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1059)|
| 0:17:48| I'm forgetting a couple other partners as well as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| But at any rate, we are getting ready to release our comprehensive tree canopy assessment here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Really what that dives into is looking at the amount of tree cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| and how things have changed in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Just a little table of what those findings were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| Essentially in Knox County, we found that the tree cover across the county has essentially not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| Inside the City of Knoxville, we have lost 1% of our tree cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| which amounts to about 732 acres of trees in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| City of Farragut, they've actually increased by 352 acres in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| So we're going to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| We have it down to the neighborhood level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| We have it down to census tracts, census blocks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| We're going to really be diving into at a local level how trees are changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| how they changed in the last 10 years, and where we need to be going in the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| And then the last thing is the tree protection ordinance I want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Where that falls at the city level is actually in two different areas in our code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| So we have Chapter 14, which is our horticulture ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| We're actually getting ready to amend that so it says urban forestry, not horticulture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| It confuses a lot of people, but essentially the horticulture ordinance is all tree related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| There's two articles in there that people look at oftentimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Article 2, which is tree protection, typically to do with private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Some of the most notable clauses in that, when we have a development that takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| they have to preserve six trees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| If they can't preserve six trees per acre, they have to plant eight trees per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| And half of those trees have to be large growth trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| There's also a tree mitigation bank that was recently passed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So if there's a hardship on that developer that is unable to plant the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| they can buy into the tree mitigation bank to allow us to plant trees to offset that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| Article 3, really, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| That pertains to trees on public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| That really has to do with what people can and can't do with public trees across the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| You can't go out there and top a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| You can't just go in properly and mulch a tree because it's in front of your yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| There's a certain level of protection over and beyond what's on private property for those public trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| We do have mitigation for public trees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| A lot of people don't realize that as far as development goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Several examples of that, if downtown, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| somebody comes in and they're wanting to develop a new site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| and there's six public trees out there, and let's say they're each at 10 inches in diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| That's 60 inches in diameter that they have to replace somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| either on that project or, again, buy into that tree mitigation bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| So we have an inch-for-inch mitigation requirement for public trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| if they are going to be impacted by a development project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| Then the last part, which you all are probably very familiar with, is the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| Really what that comes down to is the Article 12, the landscaping requirements on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| It kind of has your parking lot requirements, your screening buffer and perimeter requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| There's that alternative landscape design aspect to that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| and there are some clauses in there as far as tree preservation goes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Developers get credit for preserving certain size trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| that they don't have to replace other trees on that site if they choose to do that particular route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| How this works at the city, I sit over the umbrella for Chapter 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| and I work very closely with inspections and also with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| on a lot of the plans review that they do on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| I consult with them oftentimes on the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| They don't have an urban forester or a tree guy, per se, on that review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| so I sit there and help facilitate them if they have questions about a certain tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| or whether a certain tree is going to live based on the plans that are being submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| They tend to consult with me from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| but that umbrella typically falls under inspections and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| That's all I have, at least for my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I don't want to take up too much of your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| but I am going to open it up for any questions you all might have and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| When we hear rezonings and plan approvals for residential subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| a lot of times adjoining neighbors will petition the planning commission really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| to leave strips of trees on property that's going to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| like on a common property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Lots are getting smaller and smaller, and so when we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| how should we be considering the height of the tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| versus how close it would be to a proposed home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| First, the requirements, I should say, in Chapter 14 of the Tree Protection Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| do not pertain to single-family residential homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| so those parcels are exempt from having to plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| and or preserve a certain number of trees on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| As far as distances, the important thing I always tell folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| is when looking at preserving trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| if you're going to try to incorporate tree preservation on a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| it goes to what's going on underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| It's not so much about the proximity to the trunk of the tree as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| how much disturbance to the root system of a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Typically, what I always tell folks is you need to stay out of that drip line of a tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| If the branches or whatever are covering a certain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| you can't be bringing grading changes up to and within that drip line of that tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| That needs to be the no-go zone for a particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| As far as how far the trees need to be, as far as heights, that depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| Different trees are going to provide different amounts of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Essentially, as far as if you're looking at noise buffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| your density of trees are going to make a huge impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| more so than just the height of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| So the height really wouldn't come into play as more so as the density of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| that you're going to be putting in close proximity to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| I guess that's my 20,000-foot answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| But a lot of it just depends oftentimes on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| because trees are very dynamic in the way things are going to react.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| Every tree species is a little bit different on how they're going to work on a particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| It's very difficult to give oftentimes a one-size-fits-all resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| to some of those things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| If a right-of-way is, say, 50 feet but only 30 feet is paved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| are the other 20 feet public or private?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Great question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| The way we have it in our ordinance is whether or not there's been improvements made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Now, in instances where we've done improvements like a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| anything that falls between the sidewalk and the road does, we're public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| That right-of-way, we see it more as a right to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| So any trees – say it's your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| You, as a property owner, have every right to go out there and plant a tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| do what you want within that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| However, if there is a public safety issue or the city wants to go plant –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| excuse me, put a sidewalk in, we have a right to be able to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| But up until that point where we actually make improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| we call those private trees at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| So that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| That one comes up oftentimes, and it's very confusing for a lot of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| because when they see the parcels of land, it only comes up to where the property pens are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| And there may be another, like you said, another 20 feet up to the curb of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| that has a lot of trees and other vegetation in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| And we do – again, that's up to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| They can kind of use it, manage it how they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| But if it becomes a public issue at that point in time, we do, from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| go in there, remove trees, put in sidewalks, all of those sort of things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| So that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| How do you coordinate with KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| So KUB, on a day-to-day basis, I get e-mails all the time on tree-related issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| mainly pertains to our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| You know, just like a homeowner has trees on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| and there are electrical lines running through there, like an easement of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| they contact me on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| You know, hey, we're getting ready to go into this park, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| As far as my message, I often get questions about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| trimming of trees around utility lines and how that looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| And the reality of it is large trees and utility lines just don't mesh very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| So my – going back to my role as an educator is trying to get folks to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| that there's other trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I plant trees all the time underneath power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| We put it into our codes of which trees are properly – would be more suited under power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| Trying to educate folks, let's get the right trees under the power lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| because one thing's not going away, and that's power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And we don't want the power to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| So if we are putting large trees, that's going to be a huge impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| as far as the infrastructure that KUB has to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So my role is essentially on the – as it comes to trees under utility lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| is trying to educate people to put the right tree in the right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| I think more specifically what I was trying to ask was your pruning philosophy for the larger trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| KUB has a different pruning philosophy that isn't always healthy for the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Have you worked out that aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| So that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| So they are TreeLineUSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| TreeLineUSA, they employ certain pruning practices that are recommended for the situations that they have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:10| They are under federal mandate as far as what clearance they have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| Y'all remember maybe – I bet it's been 15, 20 years now –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| that big power outage a couple trees in Ohio caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Put something like 30, 40 percent of the entire United States out of power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| by just a couple of trees up in Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| After that, they came down and put the regulations on what is required for certain utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| and the maintenance that they have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| So they are under tight guidelines, and if they get fined, somebody's got to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| And that's typically going to be probably the rate payers as far as who's going to have to pay those fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| So my take on that, again, is they're under tight regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:57| and if the tree wasn't there or underneath those power lines to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| it's that 10-foot clearance, they wouldn't have those type of conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| So that's my thing is trying to educate, again, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| It's not put the wrong trees in the wrong location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| But overall, you know, it's not going to look pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| because if you put that requirement, that 10-foot buffer in around power line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| it's really hard to make aesthetically a tree look pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| But they do employ proper pruning cuts and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| They might be aggressive, but it's under their requirements to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| So that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I get that one a lot, and it's not a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| It's not an easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you so much, Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Before we get into the agenda review items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| I want to mention, too, that Thursday's meeting will be a hybrid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Commissioners will be in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| but we will also allow the public to connect in by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| And they'll be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Nick will be heading that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| We'll identify by the application item number on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| And so it will be a little different than what we had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| but there will be public present probably and some people by Zoom also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| So that's a little departure from what we've had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| but we're just trying to work within the system and changes that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| occurred over the last 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| And just to follow up on that, if anybody asks you all about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| we are asking people, just like we have for the last 12-plus months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| to contact us in advance by the Wednesday before the meeting at noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| and let us know that they would like to speak at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| and to clarify whether or not they'll be in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| or they'd like to participate via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| Does anybody have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| So we'll go ahead and get started on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| So item number six is 5B21SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| This is Michelle's case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| and she'll provide you an overview of why we're recommending postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So this case came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| It doesn't sound like it's magnifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| This case came to us because the applicant inadvertently built his fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| within the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| You can kind of barely see the fence line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| And then he built his pool within the setback area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| So he went to the BZA to get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| It was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| So now he's trying to close the right-of-way so he can get some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| land to add to his in order to bring his items into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| So the first blush, it looks like it was going to be a pretty easy case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| We had folks along this side who had signed off that they were in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| with the right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| There's an entrance to the park here along Sheffield Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| another one here along North Winston, and then another right-of-way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| However, since the sign went up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| we've been inundated with phone calls and e-mails from people who do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| actually use Glenmore Drive to access the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| So we are requesting 30 days to give us more time to look into the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| providing easement or maybe closing a sliver instead of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| So we're wanting to investigate our options more closely with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| And there's also some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Some of the people who signed were thinking they were signing off for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| variance instead of the right-of-way closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| So the 30 days will also give more time for word to assimilate to all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| neighbors that it's actually a right-of-way closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| and not a variance that's being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Yeah, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| I haven't looked at this situation directly yet, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| we are receiving a lot of comments from the public wanting to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| maintain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| whether it's to help somebody who's got a pool that they shouldn't have put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| where they did or a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Did y'all look at maybe, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| reducing the making an easement and still allowing access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| but not make it a public street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| That's what we want to look at more closely with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| By the time we started getting word that the neighbors were not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| it was kind of too late to start that process and have something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| by the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| So that'll give us a little more time to investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| come up with something that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| or have the applicant come up with something that we can maybe approve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| have engineering look at a little more thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Right now he's just saying he wants to create an easement as a beach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| access type easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| We're not exactly sure what that would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| where that would be, how wide it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| where it would be on his property, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| We don't have anything on paper yet to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| So did he build the pool in the wrong place or did he buy the house and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| pool had already been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| He built the pool and the fence in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I think he just didn't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| And by the time he built it and started getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| I guess complaints from the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I'm not sure how the city found out about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| but he's had numerous I guess fines at this point for not being in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| And that, is it a traversable easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Like it's where people can use that to go to the park or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| That's what he's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| but we don't have anything on paper to actually review yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| He didn't include an easement or a plat with this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| The application is just purely to close, to close the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Did he get a permit for the pool and the fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| Michelle, another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| I wonder if the staff is looking at in order to respond to some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| complaints the neighbors had regarding cars parking in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| Is there a design solution where you can maintain the right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| but not have cars drive in there so that it's simply a pedestrian access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| If he were to close, maybe a sliver of the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| So kind of going back to the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Well, I guess in this view, you can't see my cursor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| So here's the fence line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| So if he closed just to the fence line and the fence line was on the boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| that would leave the right of way open for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| So it would allow basically the function to continue as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| we don't know if that's something that the applicant would be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| He hasn't submitted anything on paper for what he has in mind for an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| We really just don't have anything to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| We've suggested that to him, but we'll see what he comes back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| I guess I was thinking of bollards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| Is there a reason that bollards could not be installed in that right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| That would be up to the city if they would be willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| but that would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| That would, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| one of the things that Mr. Clark had mentioned in one of his most recent letters was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| and my understanding from it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| is that people are using this and crossing over into the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| which shouldn't be allowed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| So bollards would solve that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| There's been other complaints about drug deals and nefarious activities along this right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and as it is right now, with it being city right of way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| they can call and the city can come out and police it, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| If that were to revert to private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| then it would become an issue between the homeowner and whoever is in their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| If they could still call the police, but it just makes it a little bit messier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Now we'll move on to item number 11, which is 3E21RZ, Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| We're recommending a different zone than what's being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Yes, so you guys originally heard this case in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| but that was the meeting where we had some Zoom difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| and Internet difficulties with Comcast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| and the Internet cut out for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| And so city council remanded this back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| so that everyone could hear it and vote on it a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| So I won't spend a whole lot of time going into the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| just enough to kind of maybe refresh your memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| and for our new commissioner to kind of give him a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| So this area is north of 640 and to the east of Broadway Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| Greenway Drive kind of connects Broadway to the Target Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| further to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| The majority of land uses along Greenway are single-family uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| There's approximately 70 properties that front Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| and this is the only multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Zoning comparison maps, so the applicant is looking for a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| that would give him multi-family use as a permissible use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| versus, well, because it's similar to what he had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| So R2 zoning was what the applicant had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| before the adoption of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| And R2 is a little bit problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| because it allowed such a broad variety of uses within its borders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| and it was kind of used all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| So there's instances where you've got noncompatible uses next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| So as part of that new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| we kind of looked at it with a more fine-tooth comb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| and designated specific zoning where we thought it was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| It was done with a lot of public input from residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| from city council members, planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| There's a lot of stakeholders that were involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| There is a floodway and floodplains, both 100 and 500 a year, on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| And then looking at the dwelling units that would be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| so actually I guess looking at the zoning first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I can't really see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| I'll try to make it a little bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| So Rn2 and Rn4 both allow single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| They both have the same lot size of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| They both allow duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| There's a little bit of difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| 7,000 square feet is the minimum for an Rn4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| 10,000 for the Rn2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| The main difference kind of comes into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| when you're looking at townhouses and multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| So multifamily is not a use that's allowed within Rn2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| even though the applicant currently has multifamily on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| He has expressed interest in getting this zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| to leave his development options open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| so feasibly he would do more multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| At 2,000 square feet, dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| that would result in up to 89 dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| and that would be allowed by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| That's not saying that's what the applicant would want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| but that is what would be allowed by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| And so then looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| one of the points in Mr. Mullen's letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| that he sent to you all this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| was that 89 units couldn't feasibly be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| So I kind of went through this exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| just to kind of see what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And so this is the lot widths on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| You've got 100-foot lot width here and 106 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So taking the setbacks into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| you could feasibly have, not that this would be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| but it would be allowed to have a 90-foot-wide building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| on one of the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| and an 83-foot-wide building on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| As far as depth, before you hit the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| you have 418 feet of depth on one property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and 427 on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So you could build a pretty big building footprint there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| go up three stories, and then you've got 89 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| This doesn't take into consideration the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| but that's just to say that there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| a good bit of dwelling units allowed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| and it would be out of character with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| So that's the reasons that we're recommending the R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| versus the R and 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| just we feel like it's more compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| It follows the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| One of the arguments in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| is that, you know, change in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| that the rezoning is a change in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| and the applicant is contending that the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| and the one-year plan are also a change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| But the sector plan is dated from 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and the one-year plan, even though it is updated annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| it always follows suit with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| So because the sector plan is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| with lots of neighborhood participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| it's a very public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| We go through public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| and these communities involve the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| A lot of stakeholders are involved as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| And the one-year process is so small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| we really don't have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| to do that kind of public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| So mainly what we do with the one-year plan updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| is kind of look for errors in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| that does not coincide with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| and kind of fix those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| We don't really do general rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| or general plan updates for broader areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| or multiple parcels together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| as part of the one-year update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| So in regards to public policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| yes, they are all public policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| but the rezoning was done more recently than any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| And then my final points for this is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| there's been a lot of debate, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| between what you can do with nonconforming uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| And per that section of the zoning ordinance at 17.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| a nonconforming building structure or use of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| lawfully existing at the time of the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| or amendment of the ordinance may be continued and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| Therefore, the multifamily and duplex structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| can remain as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| and routine repair and maintenance would be allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| and the rezoning would only affect future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Regarding comparable zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| the zoning ordinance allows for those aggrieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| to request a comparable zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| but it doesn't state that the previous zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| will be reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| It's an application like any other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| and we review it like any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| So we look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| We look at the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| We look at the zoning ordinance criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| that's associated with it and make our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| And just because a zone is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| within a specific land use doesn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| mean that it's appropriate for that land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| everywhere that land use designation exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| So each land use designation has a list of zones that it allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| and then we look at those on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| to make the best decision that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| making the zoning more in character with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| And so with that, I'll open it up to questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| I have probably a silly question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| but the chart that you were comparing the RN2 and the RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| it said that a two-family requires a minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Can I then extrapolate and say if I had a 40,000-square-foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I could have eight units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| or do I need to have each lot be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| I mean, would I have to chunk it up and subdivide it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| It depends on the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| So in RN2, you're not allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| more than one primary structure per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| So you would not be able to have multiple duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| without subdividing in RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| For RN4, you would be able to have multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| We'll go on to item number 15, 5A21RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| and we are recommending denial on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| So this one, the applicant, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| it's located kind of close to Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| So Happy Holler is where you can see my cursor again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| So Happy Holler is kind of off-central down in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| So this property, even though it sits south of Woodland here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| the topography makes it feel separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| and different from this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| So it actually feels like it's more a part of this area in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| And so looking at the aerial view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| you can see there are some commercial properties here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| some industrial along here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| and then single family adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| And that kind of coincides with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| So when you look at this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| it says that it allows light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| and general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| and the same uses that are allowed in MUCC11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| which that allows office multiple density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| or multi, sorry, medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| and traditional neighborhood residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| So it's kind of a lot of land uses allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| within that one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| And then looking at the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| you've got some IMU that's adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| some RN4 that's adjacent to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and then, again, that northern zoning at CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| So they're asking for CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| There's not any CH in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| and CH is basically designed to be put on arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| Streets that are already auto-oriented in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Davana is a local street next to single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| And just kind of looking at the aerial through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| you can see it's this area in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| all the single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| So we just didn't feel like that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| And then, again, looking at the uses that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| So it's current zoning IMU and then the CH zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| There's a lot of uses that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| that correlate between the two that go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| The uses that are highlighted in red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| are the ones that would be problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| and these are the ones that they could do by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| That includes a car wash, a drive-through facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| a gas station, heavy retail, storage yard for outdoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| secondary use or primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| a vehicle dealership, a rental vehicle dealership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| and vehicle repair and service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And we didn't feel like those would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| in this area, and CH is just too intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| for a local road in this type of environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Anyone has any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| What are they trying to do on that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| A used car dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| A used car dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| Transition to Liz here for item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| Our cord doesn't stretch far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| It doesn't stretch far enough otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| So this item, 5D21SP and 4L21RZ and 4H21SB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| you've all received quite a few comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| And Liz is going to provide an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| of why these two are related, these cases are related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and why we are recommending amending the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| to allow consideration of the OB in the mixed-use town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| the Carter Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| A little fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| So this image shows where the East County Sector Plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| mixed-use special district for Carter Town Center is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| It's generally called the four-way N area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| It's where Asheville Highway, Strawberry Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| and Andrew Johnson Highway come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| This area is considered a rural crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| with a mix of commercial, office, residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| and there are several community facilities in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| including schools, parks, a senior center, and a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| When the East County Sector Plan was updated in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| the zone districts that were recommended for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| included the town center zone, the planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| and the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| These are generally intended for larger developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| so acreages and upwards of 8 to 20 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| And staff feels that the OB zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| really is appropriate in this general area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| maybe not in all locations in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| but it is a zone district that could be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| to help accommodate a variety of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| including professional and business offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| related to activities that require separate buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| and building groupings surrounded by landscape yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and open areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| And then the intent of that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| is also to provide a centralized compact location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| for business offices, clinics, medical and dental offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| near residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| So it's really a transition zone between more commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| and lower-intensity residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| This is an example of some OB-zoned areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| So these are including a few business park locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| and some medical office clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| that have been developed under the OB zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So this is kind of what we would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| or ideally see in an OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| When the East Knox Community Plan was adopted in 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| it was noted that our development in the East County area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| should be directed to these rural crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| and corridors across East County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| And this was adopted, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| I think by the Planning Commission in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| And directing development to those corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| is essentially an effort to help protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| the more rural areas of East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Again, you can see the items that focus specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| on the Carter Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| where you see the two little circles side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| This is the general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| that the mixed-use special district is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| And then you can see the action items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| that the plan supported there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| Again, reiterating that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| should be directed to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| This shows the existing land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| in this mixed-use special district as it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| So we see that there is some office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| and commercial in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| There's also several vacant larger lots out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| perhaps for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Can you get a little closer to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| And so there are some office and commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| that have been developed in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| but there are a lot of larger lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| that are available for redevelopment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| When we look at building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| for this mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| we can see since 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| in your agenda packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| hopefully on your iPads or your little tablets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| that you can see this image a little bit more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| You can see where the development activity has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| You can see that there has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| some residential building activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| in some of the planned residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| There is some OB zoning in this mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| and there's also some RB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| So we're not proposing a zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| that isn't already existing in this mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| This is what the zoning map looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| So, again, you can see that OB zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| and you can see there's quite a bit of CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| already in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| as well as some RB zoning and industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| This is what the building permits look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| for the entire East County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| The yellow represent the detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| or single-family residential dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| The red and the purple and the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| represent the non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| So that's industrial, commercial, and institutional permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| The area circled that you see on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| is where the mixed-use special district is generally located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Liz, what does the gray dot represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| There are some gray dots up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| I think the gray dots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| they are, like, maybe telecommunications or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:42| I don't know. Actually, I might ask Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I was just curious. It's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I can't remember off the top of my head what the gray ones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| But I can look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| So, yeah, the reason staff is supporting this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| is because this really is a growth center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| for the East County area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| and OB seems to be a zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| that would allow for more development potential in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| and redevelopment opportunities in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Are there any questions about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| before I go on to a related case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Liz, how many lots or parcels are in that 387 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| There are quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| I honestly couldn't tell you how many parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| off the top of my head, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| So there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| A lot, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| And it doesn't, sorry, necessarily mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| that the OB zone district should be used in every location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| In this mixed-use area, we would look at each rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| you know, on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| That was kind of like, when you do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| do you not feel like this is a good area for restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| or for something other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I mean, like, OB is basically office, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| I mean, it's a tough time for office right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| I think a good mix, you know, would be something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| would this allow a mix of restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| and something that could develop into a center out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| So the planned commercial zone and the town center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I mean, they require larger land area typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| but, you know, you can get restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| in a planned commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| and you also could in town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| So say if someone were to develop, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| multifamily where that RB zone district is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| if they wanted to do town center nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| they would be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| because there would be some existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| And in that town center area, they could put restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| And in the existing planned commercial...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| In OB, you can do multifamily, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| You can, as long as it is only up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| I think, 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| Because I could see, if that's all allocated as OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I could see a lot of apartments initially looking out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| I mean, we obviously would review each of these rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| I've not seen a text amendment to a town center before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| So I'm just curious, I guess, what this does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| if it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Is it just pretty much giving a list of recommended rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| so that if any case comes before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| these are like the recommended list of things to zone to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| That doesn't mean that other zones aren't allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| These are just the recommended ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| for the look of the town center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| So, yeah, these are the recommended zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| The primary reason that these, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| zone districts were initially chosen was that they almost all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| require a use on review to come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| as part of the development in those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| The OB zone district does also have some uses permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| But there are also quite a few uses permitted by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| that are more medical office related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| So, you know, this would allow staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| without having to ask for an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| to change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| if they were applying for OB zoning in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| they would not have to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| As of now, if they want to do OB zoning without this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| they would have to also amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| which is when we get to the very next case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| that we're discussing what they're actually asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Gotcha. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| This brings us to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| We've received quite a few comments about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And this is at the Carter Town Center area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| It is within that mixed use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| that we were referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| The applicant is asking to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| from that mixed use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| to the office land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| They are also asking to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| from the agricultural zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| to the OB zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| This is what the current zoning map looks like for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| You can see that this parcel is adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| to some existing OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| And it is agricultural zoned currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| and adjacent to other residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| low-density residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| This is the aerial for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| And staff is recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| but we're recommending approval of the OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| And part of this is to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| this increasing interest in developing at this node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| rather than out in the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| of the East County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| So the OB zone would permit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| a little bit more intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| It would also help buffer the single family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| from some of the existing commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| that's in this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Because right now there is quite a bit of CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| which allows more intensive commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| They're coming through, I know as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| for a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| but we're really limiting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| our discussion to this extension of the OB zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| So we would basically plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| and approve OB, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Yes, so if the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| were to be approved for the mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| it would allow consideration of the OB zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| rather than changing the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| that the sector plan looks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| Let's see, I'll toggle back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| So now if we have this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| there would be a little dot of pink right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| if their request was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| to show that the office land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| would be permitted for consideration at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| So staff is really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| attempting to try to think more comprehensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| about this entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| And this, you know, application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| just sort of helped open up the discussion for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Not all of our mixed-use special districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| have specific zones called out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| Some are a little bit more open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| and we'll just say commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| office uses, industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| But since this one is so specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| we wanted to take a deeper look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| So what will the effect be on this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| if we deny the sector plan but approve OB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Will that accomplish the goals of this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| So, yes, it will allow consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| of the OB zone district at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| So that's actually why it's before the item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| that we're recommending denial of the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| because we're recommending approval of consideration for OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| for this entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| It will open up more opportunities and options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| for OB-type development at this node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| rather than just at that one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Is there a lot of opposition to the prior item on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| Or, I mean, is there going to be a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| So there's been quite a lot of opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| to the use on review that's coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And it's getting sort of tangled up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| with what we're reviewing as a zoning amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| and a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| So the use on review is a little more controversial of an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| So if I understand this, you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| or the staff is saying that because we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| including OB in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| and this property is within that region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| we don't need to look at a sector plan amendment for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| I personally like what you're doing with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| but what if that gets recommended for denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Then there would not be an automatic sector change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| for this guy, applicant, I should say applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| And so he would have a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| that wasn't supported by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| No, that's actually why we read first into the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| the plan amendments before we handle the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| because if it's denied, if the plan amendment's denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| then the zoning could potentially be denied as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| or it would almost have to be denied, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| We would recommend that you would deny the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| If you don't approve the plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| because the rezoning needs to comply with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| If item 10, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| If item 10 is approved, then by the time we reach item 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| the sector plan amendment would be moot, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| Yes, unless you still just for whatever reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| wanted to hollow out this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| of the mixed use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| to make it pink rather than part of the whole district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| If you didn't hollow it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| then you'd have to disapprove the zone request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| because it wouldn't match the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| I'm going to try to say this out loud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| because I'm just checking myself that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| But if item 10 was approved, then once we got to item 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| the rezoning would still need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| It would be allowed, but it would need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| My premise is 10 is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| Then what happens to 12 and the sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| If 10 is denied, then we just consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| As a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| What she's saying is more than likely it will go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| and we won't need to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| But if for some reason it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| we'll consider it and decide then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Any other questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Item number 27, 5M21RZ and 5C21SB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Liz is going to review this recommendation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| So this one is at the northwest side of Maynardville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| and Fort Sumter Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| This is in the rural area of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| The applicant is asking to go from agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| and hillside protection to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| and hillside protection on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| and they're asking for a rezoning from agriculture to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3905)|
| 1:05:13| This shows the growth policy plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| You can see that it is pretty deeply located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| within the rural area along Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| This is what the zoning looks like, however, for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| The CA zoning that you see across Maynardville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| predates the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| So CA zoning since the growth policy plan's adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| would not be something that staff would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| It's also important that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| the existing land use plan for this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| because although there is existing CA zoning there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| it has not been used for commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| since it's been in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| So some of the parcels are even actually vacant currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| so there is some opportunity for CA development in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| just not at this expanded location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| This is what the sector plan shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| So the sector plan recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| that there is commercial zoning in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| and noted that it should be a rural commercial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| and the rural commercial allows consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| of the rural commercial zone district in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| but not, however, the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| So they're asking for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| a general commercial designation on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| so it would be much more intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| than the adjacent rural commercial that's next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| This is an aerial, a 2020 aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| So you can see that it's located, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| at a major arterial, Maynardville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| but, you know, there has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| really substantial improvements into this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| since the last sector plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| and commercial uses aren't really supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| by the type of infrastructure that's in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| So staff is recommending denial of both of these items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| so that's why we're presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Do you know what he wants to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| So I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| He had mentioned at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| some sort of, like, rental, heavy equipment, vehicle storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| I mean, I think he's just interested in expanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| some sort of commercial uses that he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| maybe at another location at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| So, Lisbeth, does the CA and the RC compete with each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| Does the zoning and the sector plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| They do. They do, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| ...across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Yeah, and it's primarily because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| and we see that all across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| There are lots of pockets of CA that happened, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| probably when the zoning ordinance was initially adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| in the 50s or 60s that just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| And the sector plan came in later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| And the sector plans came along later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| and also are trying to, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| rectify the adoption of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| that limits a lot of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| we can make in the rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| based on the general limited infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| with, you know, changes that have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| obviously, since the growth plan was adopted for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Okay. Any other questions for Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| Okay. Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| Another quick transition here to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:21| So the next item is item number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| It's a concept plan use and review for Creek Valley Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| Mike's going to review a couple key elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| related to staff's review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| So this first project...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Hey, Mike, can you pull that down a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| The mic, will it go down a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| All right. Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| This first project is out in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Just to give a quick orientation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| We have Oak Ridge Highway just to the south of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| This property fronts on West Emory Road and Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| Pellissippi Parkway is off to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| We zoom in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| One of the major aspects I want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| is just how we come up with our density calculations on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| What we see here is a large portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| is in the F floodway zone in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| that used to align with the FEMA floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| And I'll show you the actual floodway line here in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| but the floodway zone is, I think, based on something maybe from the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| or maybe it was the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| The floodway is kind of always ebb and flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| on where that boundary is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| But we take this acreage out of their density calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| So their acreage that they can use for density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| is just anything out of that floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| Let me go to the next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| So this shows the new floodway boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| And what you're seeing in the red line here is the no-fill line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| So they cannot fill any of the property back towards the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| So what you'll see is all the lots are up closer to West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| and over to Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| The no-fill line is half the distance from the floodway boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| to the 100-year flood boundary, which is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| So that's where that comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Let me go to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| So this is changing orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| The red line on this map is the no-fill line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| What you're seeing from the lot layout is pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| One access road in from West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| and then the cul-de-sac roads that go north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| They are providing a 25-foot common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| along the entire frontage of West Emory and Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| This is to allow the double-frontage lots at the depth that they have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| They don't need to do any plantings or anything in that common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| It just needs to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| to allow the lot depths that they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| One other concern that we've heard from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| is flooding has always been a concern out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| As flooding commissioners have been reviewing cases for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| they know along Beaver Creek there's always flooding concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| But this intersection of Beaver Ridge Road and West Emory Road is also a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| The county does have that intersection in the mobility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| for a Horizon 2026 funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| Obviously, that's always a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| There's no guarantee that that's when that would come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| but it's also going to take coordination with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| West Emory Road, right in front of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| is county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| To the east, with south on this map, is TDOT road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| That's a TDOT route from going west on West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| until Beaver Ridge Road, and then TDOT's facility route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| goes along Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| It'll take coordination between those two organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| The right-of-way that this development is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| should accommodate the improvements that are necessary to this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| From that perspective, that's a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| Anybody have any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I can go through the calculation if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| but it's in the staff report if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| This is a question about the frontage to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| You said that there is some extra buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| They don't have to do any plantings because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Silly question, but are these houses facing Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| or their backs are to Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Yeah, their backs are to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| They'll face the internal road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| You can see that there's the 25-foot common area strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| The reason why they need the 25-foot common area strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| the subdivision regulations have a double frontage standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| where if your lot backs up to a collector or arterial street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| which West Emory is, the lot depth has to be 150 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| One way around that is to put in a 25-foot common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| between the lot and the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| The other option is to ask for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| They would prefer not to go the variance route if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| so they were able to accommodate the lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| while providing the 25-foot common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| But the common area is just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| It's maintained by the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| They can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| They can plant there if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| So they can dress it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| It doesn't have to be just like a grassy lawn or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| It can be used by the HOA for landscaping purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and buffering if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| But it could also mean it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| It looks like from the road an incredibly long lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| to someone's backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| It's not the property owner's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| so anything they do back there would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| So the HOA will decide how that common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| is actually developed in whatever way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| Yeah, the developer or the HOA, depending on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| If the developer has an idea of what they want to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| they can go ahead and install something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Or if it's left pretty much open and available for the HOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| the HOA can eventually take it over and do something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| These lots that we're discussing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| with the double frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| they are appreciably smaller than, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| the lots across the street which are existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| So my question is, or I guess my issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| we're supposed to look at harmonious development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| And it would seem to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| since we're not going to make the lots any bigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| harmonious development might actually just end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| being a deep planting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| a vegetative buffering on that common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| so that you can't see the small lots from the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| and it maintains a rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| I think this area is in a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| I think if we buffer it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| it'll probably end up buffering to similar-sized lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| sometime in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| So it's definitely a possibility, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| to do landscaping in that area as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| Hey, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| And forgive me, I can't hear that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| But between these cul-de-sacs and the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| there's all that open area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Wouldn't that be really cool to take some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| and have soccer fields?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| I mean, that's grass most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| They...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| There is possibility for some non-structured use down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| The floodway zone does allow some park activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| I think it would have to be done in a way that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| obviously doesn't raise the level of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So it would just take coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| with the county's engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| to figure out a way to make it work within the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| But, yeah, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| All right. Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Let's move on to the next one, which is item number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| 5SB21C and 5D21UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| There's a number of variances requested for this one or needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| So, Mike will review the rationale behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Yeah. Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| So the Catatoga project, you see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| it's on North Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| just south of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| And there's two major things I want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| one being their access and the road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| and then also, as Amy mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| the number of variances that they're requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| and why staff is recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| Let me go to the plan here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| I'll just talk about the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| and improvements that are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| The traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| one of the recommendations of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| is to install a left-turn lane for the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| and then also a right-turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| This is in a pretty large corner of North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| Luckily, this is on the outside of the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| which helps from a sight, distance, and safety standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| And definitely the addition of the turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| will help with safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| Just so you know what's going on at that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| The boulevard entrance is something that we usually request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| when a project gets over 150 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4770)|
| 1:19:37| This one is only 120, I believe, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| but they are requesting rezoning of a neighboring lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| that would put them over that 150 mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| So that's one reason why we're seeing a boulevard entrance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Let me go to the full-size plan and give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4792)|
| 1:20:03| One concern that we, as staff, have with road design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| is straight sections of road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| and the possibility for increased speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Most of these roads are designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| for either 25-mile-per-hour, 30-mile-per-hour speeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| A lot of them are trying to design to 25-mile-per-hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| But if you have a long, straight stretch of road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| it's hard to get cars to slow down to that speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| You see up here in the northwestern part of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| the roads just have a lot of horizontal curve to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| And that's just to help, you know, make cars make turns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| make them slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| And a lot of those variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| almost the majority of the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| are dealing with those curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| They're just either too sharp of a curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| because they're supposed to be 250-foot radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| and so most of them are much less than 250-foot radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| There's also tangents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| so the distance between the curves are also too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| So while it's a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| variance to the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| in this kind of application, it makes sense in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| And that's why staff is supportive of these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Ultimately, we feel that it will make a safer road design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| in a safer neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| I mentioned briefly that there was a neighboring parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| that could add some more units to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| get it over the 150-unit count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| This future Road D connection is to this property to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| They have a request for rezoning this month on our agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| So the intent there, if they get the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| is to expand this subdivision over into that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| and provide access to this new section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| that we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| All right. Thanks, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Mike, do you mind bringing me the HDMI cord?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4927)|
| 1:22:28| So I'm just going to review a couple items with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| The first one is 5A21OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| It's item number 47 on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| It is an ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| related to the sign section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| And I bring up this slide because this item has been around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| So for those of you who haven't been on the commission that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| I wanted to be sure to share this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| So this conversation came up during the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| to the city of Knoxville zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| So we had some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| with the stakeholder advisory committee about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| about whether or not we needed sign standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| specifically for the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| The institutional zone, for a little additional background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| is a new zone that was introduced with the city's new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| And so there were not, when the sign code was updated back in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| it did not include standards for the zone because it didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| And so it was, as part of the update to the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| it was lumped into commercial sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| And there has been an interest for some time now, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| in creating new institutional standards, sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| So in October of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| city council had asked us to develop new signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| for the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| If you all recall, a couple members of this commission as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| made the suggestion that we indeed needed to take a look at the sign code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and see if we needed to add specific standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| for the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| And so that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| So from November of last year until early this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| we've been meeting with some key stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| to develop those new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| And some of those stakeholders included the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| We've met with representatives from Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| a regional medical center, University of Tennessee Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| Tennessee Children's Hospital, and Scenic Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5070)|
| 1:24:38| So the summary of what we're proposing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| is to eliminate the institutional zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| from the commercial and industrial sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| And then we created a new section specifically for institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| And these, the sign and height standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| closely align with office and office park zoning district standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| And so this is just a comparison of what we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| on the left-hand column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| and in the right-hand is what's currently being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| And what is proposed, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| is what's currently allowed in the office and office park district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5110)|
| 1:25:20| Additionally, we added a new section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| under the master sign plans for unified developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| to one of the main concerns coming out of this whole discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| with the hospitals is they wanted additional flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| to address unique needs that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| in particular for institutions that have an emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| And they wanted to be able to use the master sign plan process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| to be able to modify sign regulations to meet those unique needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| rather than having to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| for every single sign that they needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| So that was one of the compromises that we came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| in these discussions that I mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| that have been occurring since last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| So we do allow them, through this section 13.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| to come in under the master sign plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| which is a process that comes before you all for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| We also added a new provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| to allow signs to be externally illuminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| provided that no light source is visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| from the public right-of-way or adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| We also added that to another one of our districts last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| Allowing, again, healthcare facilities with an emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| to internally illuminate signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| upon approval of a master sign plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| So it was really important to some of the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| that, you know, exceptions to the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| that there would be a public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| And so that public review would occur before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| And then we added, this is language specific to the institutional district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| allowing institutional campuses to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| under the master sign plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| So our recommendation is for you all to approve these text amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| to include the specific standards that we've identified here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| And again, these amendments are intended to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| those concerns regarding size and height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| of signs in the institutional district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| but allowing hospitals with an on-site emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| to be able to come in through the master sign plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| I will note, you should have had a copy of Article 13 in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5235)|
| 1:27:21| I made some clarifications at the request of one of those stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| and after consulting with the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| So they're very minor, and you'll see them on page 2 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Sorry, there's no page numbers on here, but it's page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| It's highlighted in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| It just clarifies the on-site emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| So we just made a couple of clarifications to make it really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| that those are the facilities that can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| through the master sign plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| How do the healthcare providers feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| Are they, I mean, to me, I don't think we should be compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| on what they need for emergency rooms in terms of internally lit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| externally lit, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| That's very important, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| And I'm just curious about how they feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| Based on my conversation with them, they are happy with this outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| It does provide them with the flexibility that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| to avoid the BZA process, which they currently have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| to vary the sign height, the sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| They have to go through that process for each individual sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| So they were very involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| They are supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| It did take some time to get to this point where everyone agreed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| yes, it does make sense for them to be able to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| the master sign plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| And that's how they typically want to present their sign packages anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| is as one comprehensive, for one comprehensive review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| Because when they do update them, they generally update them all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Anybody else have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| And the next item is, this is one I just wanted to quickly go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| It's number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| It's coming from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| And, again, for those of you who haven't been on commission that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| per Article 7, Section 801C of the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| it requires the planning commission to review and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| on the annual capital improvement program that goes before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| And I'm just going to assume that you all had a chance to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| If you have not, I encourage you to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| And there was a memo that was prepared by the city's finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| to just provide some additional highlights, you know, to their CIP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| It's a very public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| They're having the mayor's held hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| There's going to be a couple of council hearings on it as well coming up this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| But, again, it's just part of the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| that it comes in through planning commission before going on to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| Any questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Do we have any other items that you wanted us to touch on that we didn't cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| Amy, would it be timely to give us a brief update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| on the progress of the PR zone review that the staff is going through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Our next step in that process is to send out a marked-up version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| of the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| Again, for those of you who might be newer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| we've been working with a number of different stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| over the last number of months to take a closer look at the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| and see if there are improvements that can be made to it to make it easier to administer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| but also just make it clarify maybe some of the unclear language in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| So our next step, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| I will say that we've just been really busy with development plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| and so it hasn't happened as quickly as we had hoped as staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| but we intend to present a draft marked-up version of that to the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| that we've been working with, and then from that it will eventually end up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| So I anticipate in the next three or four months that you all will see a version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5490)|
| 1:31:38| And I know a late entry to your work schedule was the design standards for CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5498)|
| 1:31:47| So when that does start to come forward, you'll let the planning commission know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| because that's an issue with some of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| All right. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210511-agenda-review?start=5526)|
