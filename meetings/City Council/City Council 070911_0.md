| 0:07:12| Item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| 6A is an application for a retailer certificate for Jacqueline Eleanor Cronin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| There was a question, as I understand it, about the proximity of this location to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=434)|
| 0:07:38| property owned by Buffett Height Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| My understanding is Buffett Height Baptist Church has two parcels of property that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| undeveloped with no improvements on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=468)|

| 0:08:04| 500 feet from any church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| The fact that the property is owned by the church doesn't make it a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| If there's a church building on it, it would be a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| There is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| So, in my opinion, there's no problem with the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| I only have one brief item for mayor's report tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| I want to let you know that I have, you know, the way the approval process works for MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| appointments is you send them to the state for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| So this won't be final until they approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| I want to let you know I have submitted the name of Michael Kane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| I think a lot of you know Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| He has been the president of Fountain City Town Hall for five, six years, Rob, a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| before I was in this office anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| So we've submitted that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Hopefully, we'll hear back from the state and that will become official in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| two or three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Reports of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| First, this Thursday at 7 o'clock, there's going to be an informal public meeting about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| the potential road construction at the intersection of Tazewell Pike and Beverly Road out in Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| There's a discussion about the possibility, and I want to emphasize possibility because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| it is not a done deal by any stretch of the imagination, of some road widening and putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| in a signal at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| Folks from the city engineering, TDOT, and the transportation planning organization will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Once again, it's this Thursday, the 13th, 7 o'clock at Northside Christian Church, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| is 4008 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Second, we have a city election going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| Most folks have their attention elsewhere right now, but the city elections are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Early voting is going on right now at four different locations and an election day coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| up September 25th, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Turnout during early voting has been abysmal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| To be blunt about it, hopefully that's a reflection on the folks who have been in city government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=608)|
| 0:10:18| but nevertheless, people need to get out and vote and a reminder that there will be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| election with a runoff in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| What we have here is an award received by the city of Knoxville and really the lion's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| share of the credit goes to Dave Hill and to many, many people who have been involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| in the South Waterfront process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| The award is from the Tennessee chapter of the American Planning Association and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| for Knoxville's South Waterfront Vision Plan and the development of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| It was recognized through the receiving of this award, the granting of this award, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| outstanding, the award of the year, the plan of the year, I guess, the outstanding planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| award for a plan, excuse me, and I think it just recognizes all the work that many, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| people in the city of Knoxville put into developing the vision plan for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Thanks for presenting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Yeah, I guess I'll follow up real quickly on that saying another part of our brilliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| visioning and planning is going on in Lonsdale and just want to announce the next public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| meeting on that is going to be a week from tonight, September 18th, 530 at New Friendship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| Baptist Church on Texas Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| It's a chance for the community to come together and talk about some next steps and options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Everyone's invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Any other council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| 8A is a resolution appointing Venus Stiles to serve as a member of the Citizens Advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| Committee to the Knoxville Area Transit Authority, requested by Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16, Article 11, Section 16-420, Section B2 of the Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| of Ordinances of the City of Knoxville, regulating charitable solicitation on public streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| requested by Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| I'm actually just going to say a motion to postpone and to remind everybody, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| we had agreed we were going to have a workshop on this, and I guess to ask Ms. Mitchell to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| try and schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| When this came up before, we had a lot of discussion about how we need to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| So I'd like to move to postpone this for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| The motion is to postpone for six weeks and it's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Is there any discussion on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| No, but I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| We've already had a solicitation very recently that involved an intersection, Kingston Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| And I had several calls about that because, really, it was a very dangerous situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| and I don't know, do we, I just feel that a six-week postponement concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| That would make it about ten weeks out before we could take any action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| And the fall is often a very popular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Is there any possibility, you think, that we could arrange to have this workshop or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| discussion prior to six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| I would be very open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| My sense was six weeks guarantees we can get the workshop in, and I always worry if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| do it, I think the next workshop is taken and the one after that would be a four-week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| So, but let's, if it's okay with the second, we'll amend this for a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| That way, if we can get that in, we get it done quickly, and if we need to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| it again, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| I think it would be so wise, given the four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Okay, amended to postpone for four weeks, and the second said that was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Okay, all those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| 9B is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 07-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Yeah, I think we need to amend this, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| We have, a little later on the agenda, the contract with Mercer on the salary survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| and we need to amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| I think Director Martin might be able to explain the details of this, and I'd like to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| whatever he suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| Thank you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| What's on the agenda, if you'll notice, the ordinance now does incorporate money to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=880)|
| 0:14:49| the contract with Mercer, that's Section 4, and so we had added that to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| for your consideration tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| So it actually is written in this already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| It is already in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| So we don't need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| But it is different from what you voted on in the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| So we need to amend it to make it look like the paper in progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| So we do need to amend it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| So, was that your actual motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I think, if I'm correct, what we're doing is amending to add the Section 4 that is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Any further discussion on that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Okay, all those in favor of amending, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| I move an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 19, Section 19-11, Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| 116, actually, B, to provide for service by mail of citations for excessive false alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=956)|

| 0:18:50| I know Councilman Becker is serving as our representative on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| This was something that was first discussed during budget hearings last year and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| council requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I think it's an important study, and I'm very anxious to see the outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Councilman Becker, for serving on that committee for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Yeah, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| I think the study committee, I think, is now going to become the guidance or advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| And Councilman Becker's on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| I see Officer Coffey is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1151)|

| 0:19:15| So I do think we're off to a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| I think, you know, obviously we have a lot of work to do, but I feel good about the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| that's happened so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Mayor, a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I noticed in the report-out schedule there are intermediate reporting steps throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Will council receive that information before the final report, or will that just be internal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Larry, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1174)|

| 0:20:16| we'll have to bring it up every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1216)|

| 0:21:18| issue of flooding on First Creek in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1278)|

| 0:21:27| 1970s, but in 1978, the city balked at the edge of my neighborhood, Chickamauga Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| and Broadway at the cost, and the work stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1293)|

| 0:22:08| high, and that's what I would really like for you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Seven houses and one apartment building are going to have to be demolished in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| achieve this plan, and upwards of 50 trees that screen my neighborhood from Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| are probably going to have to be cut, and that's a very painful issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| I am proud to live in a historic inner-city neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| My neighborhood has been well-maintained over eight decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Property values have remained solid, even as some other neighborhoods around me have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| experienced decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Many of these neighborhoods have experienced a resurgence in recent years, I'm glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I've been told that in years past, appraisers often looked to my neighborhood for comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| values for appraisals for real estate purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| I'm a city resident and a city taxpayer, but I am also a Knox County resident and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| a Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I feel as though my welfare and that of my neighborhood is being sold out to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| who are building new subdivisions and shopping malls north of me by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Knox County made a legally binding commitment to enact a flood control ordinance equal in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| every way to the city's ordinance, and years later this has still not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| The current county ordinance passed on first reading would dilute the Knox County ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| We in my neighborhood are every bit as much Knox County citizens as are the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| of Carnes, Gibbs, and Corrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| We may reach the day in the not-too-distant future if Knox County does not pass and rigorously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| enforce a flood control ordinance equal to the city's, that the city will be compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| to buy and demolish more and more houses in the city because of development in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| and that is just plain wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| I urge you to support the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Thank you, Mr. Cottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| I'm seeing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I have a question for Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Okay, Mr. Cottom, Councilman Becker has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| You don't necessarily need to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| I just need to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Mr. Cottom, two years ago you were at that podium saying we should do this, and at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| time Council had quite a fight and didn't take this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| We actually chose to give the county time to try and do the right thing on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| and I just want to publicly say you were right two years ago, and personally I wish I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| followed your advice then and certainly plan to follow it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Councilman Roddy, I'm not sure who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| I think many of us on Council and many city taxpayers are out of patience with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| Commission and their response to the Urban Growth Agreement of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Although this resolution is already formally a part of the record of this meeting, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| like to respectfully ask Council and the audience's indulgence while we ask our city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| Cindy Mitchell, to read out loud this resolution into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| I think the language is strong, maybe not strong enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| If I told Mr. Swanson if I'd written it, it might not have been so pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| So, I would indulge Mrs. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| I'd like the entire resolution read into the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Whereas, pursuant to TCA subsection 6-58-101 at SEC and 51-1-113 on January 11, 2001, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1522)|
| 0:25:31| City of Knoxville and the County of Knox entered into an agreement approved by a majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| both City Council and County Commission with respect to the adoption of a growth plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| whereas, section 7 of the reference contract between the City of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| specifically provides as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| If the county has not done so prior to the execution of this agreement, the county will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| adopt drainage standards for development that are at least as strict as the drainage standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| used by the city within 60 days of the execution of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| This agreement applies to any drainage basin containing water that flows into the municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| boundaries of the city and whereas, the county commission recently amended its proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| concerning stormwater so as to adopt drainage standards which are substantially and materially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| less stringent than the drainage standards which have been adopted by the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| and whereas, there are numerous areas located within the City of Knoxville including areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| where drainage flow originates in drainage basins outside the corporate limits of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| City of Knoxville but which flow into the city which continue to experience significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| drainage problems, damages and losses associated with periodic flooding and whereas, City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| is of the opinion that Knox County's recent amendment to their proposed stormwater drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| ordinance fails to comply with section 7 of the January 11, 2001 agreement which was entered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| into in good faith by the county commission and City Council and City Council is of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| further opinion that compliance with such agreement is necessary in order to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| in reducing and or eliminating flooding within certain sections of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| Now therefore, be it resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville, section 1, the Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| of the City of Knoxville hereby respectfully urges the Knox County Commission to take all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| steps necessary to comply with the January 11, 2001 agreement between the City and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| County and to adopt stormwater drainage standards which are at least as strict as those utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| by the City for development of those drainage basins which flow into the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| Section 2, upon adoption the City Recorder is hereby respectfully requested and directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| to forward a true and correct copy of this resolution to County Mayor Mike Ragsdale and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| to each member of the Knox County Commission advising them of City Council's action with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| respect to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Section 3, this resolution shall take effect from and after its passage, the public welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I want to, you know, take the opportunity to belabor the point that this is not a stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| poking exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| It's honoring your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| It's doing what you agreed to do whether you do it now or whether you should have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| it back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| I'd respectfully submit it needs to be done and we need to get on with life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| I went through some archives of newspaper clippings before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| I mean, we've had a couple of dry summers, but they were preceded by some very wet years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| I've seen the photographs of where firefighters out of station number 15 at Estrey and Jacksboro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| Pike were literally rescuing people by boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| I went out and personally saw where the intersections of Broadway, Fairmont, and Emberlin, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| were getting around in canoes and stores were being flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| This isn't about necessarily your basement getting flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| It's about the first floor of your living area getting flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| In the past three years, I've seen behind Granger Avenue, the city greenway there where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| the water was so severe, it was actually going over a foot bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| It's bad and it will be bad again and we need to have action to help remedy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| Granted, the county taking, living up to their word won't resolve all of it, but it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| help and you've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| One thing, I have been contacted by folks I represent out in Fountain City who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| encouraged some of their representatives in not just Fountain City but out in the Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| This nice lady who called me said, well, this commissioner out in Halls was saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| I and the rest of the city council had leaned on this outside engineering firm to pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| them into doing certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| The lady said, even before I got to say anything, she knew that was not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| I've also heard someone on commission saying that city engineers are doing this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| they want development to be more expensive outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| I have no doubt that that's not true either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Folks just need to honor their word, do what's right and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Just to refresh my memory, Bob, what exactly did we not do last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| Two years ago, two and a half years ago, Councilman Frost brought a resolution to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| that was saying to county commission, we want you to live up to your promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| Essentially this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Essentially this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| At that moment, county commission had just done a little step in the direction of improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| their stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Some of us, myself included, said we should encourage them moving forward rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| demand that they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| We had quite an argument about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| I think, personally, I was thinking at that time that the county was moving in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| I had faith in what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| We did not pursue and then they did nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| So we didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Didn't approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Well, I actually don't feel like it's a mistake to give someone some time and some room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| And at the time, the climate seemed to indicate that they were, in fact, moving in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I mean, our relationship with the county is one based on trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| But it's being threatened seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| I don't really see this as saber rattling or a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| I see this as an affirmation that that trust is threatened right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| And so that's why my name is on the sponsor on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Councilwoman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Well, I appreciate that bit of history because I was going to repeat about a bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| When I looked at this document and Ms. Mitchell read it to us, the date of January 11, 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1941)|
| 0:32:31| speaks loudly, I think, to all of us sitting on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| For five of us, that was the second week that we served on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| And it was one of the first orders of business that was before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| No, you're shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| So 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| This was January 2001, the date of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| We came in at the end of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| 2002, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| So it was the year before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I beg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| This was the previous council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| This was the previous council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| I guess maybe I was here so much, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| We'll credit you with time served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| I was sitting there so much, I thought I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Well, I was convinced that we had dealt with this more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I guess what I want to say is that, you know, I think we have dealt in trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| And I think we've dealt in many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| And I really, at this point in time, feel that I haven't been accountable to my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=1994)|
| 0:33:38| I haven't been accountable to the taxpayers of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| And this is continuing to be a debate that just does not need to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| And I think it would be irresponsible of us at this point, six years later, not to take this action this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2025)|
| 0:33:54| And that was one reason I wanted to sponsor this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| I want you to know I've had some phone calls about this, surprisingly, and encouraging me to take a strong stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2037)|
| 0:34:06| And I think a number of people are looking at us for that kind of leadership and feeling that we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| You know, I'm a county taxpayer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| So these folks on the county commission are working for me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| And I want to encourage them to do the right thing for me as a county taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| so that the county can be in a relationship with the city that's a good, strong, healthy one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| because we all want to see Knox County move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| And I think that this is one thing that is a bit confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| not to have these standards the same in the city as they are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2080)|
| 0:34:49| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| I just want to follow up on the comments of some of my colleagues, and I really appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| I think they're all to the point and very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| And going back to what Councilman Woodhull said, that these relationships are based on trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| You know, local government to local government, we have to have a basis on which to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| And for us to ask that the other party live up to their commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2115)|
| 0:35:24| and for that to be characterized as saber rattling, I think is very, very wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| You know, I would ask that they, being the county commission, respond with integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2131)|
| 0:35:41| and fulfill the commitment that they or their predecessors put down in this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| I just, to say that we don't have to do that because we don't think it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2149)|
| 0:35:59| or because we don't want to, I just find that hard to comprehend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| I really struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| You know, I'm not saying that people have wrong motivations necessarily, but I wonder what the motivation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2167)|
| 0:36:16| When there's a constant attempt to water down, it appears to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| The concrete drainage pipe is just one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| I mean, there's so much leeway in this where the director of engineering in the county can essentially interpret as he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| or she chooses and can decide whether or not this applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| So it becomes guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| It doesn't become regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| And I just, I think to me that is a world away from what the city does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| and, therefore, what the county agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| And I just, I can't understand why there is such a great reluctance to live up to what they agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2214)|
| 0:37:04| I think that is the thing, the place of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| And to do any less, unfortunately, speaks volumes if they choose to do that on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| I think they have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| We have second readings, and we go back and say, gosh, well, we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| We missed it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And we've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| And everybody needs to be given that leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| But if they choose to pass the ordinance as it was passed on first reading and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| then I think that will be a real shame and will speak volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| Hopefully they will stand up and take a position of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I'm hopeful that they will still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Well, I agree with all my colleagues here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| And I would just like for my name to be added to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Mine as well, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Councilman Bailey as well, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| 11-L is the resolution adopting the updated West City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Yeah, I actually really like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I was impressed at the thinking that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Actually, I have two questions for Mr. Donaldson about it, one related to sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| We thought a lot in this body about how we move to denser developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| how we get more mixed-use commercial residential built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| And interestingly, there's a proposal for the downtown west area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| which most of us think of as a traditional shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and trying to move it towards a more mixed-use feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| And I just wanted to ask Mr. Donaldson to say a few words about how that transition happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| because it does seem to be a difficult thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| In the case of the area around downtown west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| there actually is some vacant parcels that would lend themselves easily to a residential sort of infill development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2354)|
| 0:39:24| that could augment the existing entertainment and retail uses that are in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| and lead to a true mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| In this planning process, we quite literally went along the Kingston Pike corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| and did an analysis of building improvement value to land value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| and were able to identify several areas where that ratio was fairly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| And those are the areas that we have called out in the plan as having the most potential for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| And if that redevelopment takes place, then adding residential to the mix in fairly high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| would lead to the sort of mixed-use development that we see, that we want to see along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2408)|
| 0:40:17| The Bearden Village area and the downtown west really jumped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| and then there was an area kind of midway between the two as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| But there are opportunities to convert large areas of asphalt that are used for parking to a more intense mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2428)|
| 0:40:38| And in doing that, you can reduce the demand for parking because you have shared uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| and lead to encouragement of transit along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| This is more a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| I'm a big believer that we need sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| We need to allow pedestrian connectivity to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| There's a chart on page 30 of the sector plan that actually lists out a five-year plan for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| And as I read that, it's pretty much saying that the city is going to build sidewalks on all of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| and several other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I actually made a request of engineering to look at how much that might cost, but we all know it's going to cost a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| And I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| While I'd love to see that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| I don't know that it's necessarily good to put out plans that say we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| But I'm also concerned about some level of, you know, this is kind of a Christmas tree list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| and sometimes that's easier to do than to actually think hard about what's needed and what will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| I want to support this, but I'd also like to ask that we look harder at recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| especially on sidewalks, to be real, to really say if we are able to spend a million dollars here in the next five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| what do we really need to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| or something that gets realistic to do the harder work about priorities on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| And I just want to sort of put that on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| I think that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Councilman Hoquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Well, following up on that, Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| I think that as we move towards redevelopment of these areas, I think that's what generates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| or triggers the rational investment in amenities or facilities like sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| Maybe amenities isn't the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| They're too crucial and too key to the function of any development like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| But there has to be something to drive it financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| You know, the money has to be on the table, so to speak, to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| And as much as we'd like to see the federal government drop money from the sky, you know, to pay for that to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| there's probably going to be less and less of that over time, as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| with the constraints that the federal government is facing, especially in the area of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| But I think that's really where it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| As we see sections of these commercial areas and the arterials redeveloped and get higher density mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| as Mr. Donaldson is referring to, that's part and parcel of that redevelopment, and that's what triggers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| I'll just say, knowing this area, of course, and knowing the sidewalk designations there, I think it is a Christmas list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2593)|
| 0:43:23| And, you know, if you don't wish and you don't write a letter to Santa, you just might be cut out entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2603)|
| 0:43:33| And my observation is these sector plans, wonderfully, are a public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| and so they reflect the people who are particularly impacted in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| And I just know that many of the people who are developing in that area feel that sidewalks are a needed amenity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2627)|
| 0:43:58| for it to completely be built out and developed to its maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| So I think that's why you see this Christmas list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| and I think we all know that, unfortunately, we don't have that big bag of toys that we can distribute like we wish we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| But I do think it is to look at, and I think very often when developers are looking at an area, they may want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2654)|
| 0:44:24| And as long as that is a part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| they will recognize that the city would welcome their participation in offering some of these amenities with their developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| 12A is an emergency ordinance adopting a temporary 60-day moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| upon the issuance of building permits for exterior construction in the Edgewood Park neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| pending completion and implementation of an IH1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| Requested by Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Is there anything pending here that has motivated this moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| I'm just curious because it seemed like we had gotten into one of these over here in South Knoxville not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| and it wasn't thought out properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| I think there are two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| One, when we requested the IH1 overlay, the initial thought of MPC was we can just take the guidelines that exist now and apply them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| Once they looked at the neighborhood, they decided we've got to redo some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| So there was a considerably longer period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| But, yes, there were a lot that actually is being cleared now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| And interestingly, my understanding of legality is that that lot might not be covered by this because work has already taken place on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2745)|
| 0:45:56| So while there was one that sort of prodded everybody to move, there was a good reason to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| and potentially other lots that this could cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| I guess I just have some concerns that, you know, will this thing be complete within 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| or will you be coming back or will they be coming back and asking that we extend this for another 30 or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| Because, you know, I'm pretty familiar with this neighborhood that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| and there's all types of housing in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| And I guess my question that goes along with my mind is will somebody building a house really adversely affect this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2792)|
| 0:46:45| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| If it's to a modern, you know, style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| The challenge, part of the reason, Councilman Hall, for the IH1 overlay is that right now you can take a double-wide trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2809)|
| 0:46:59| in new places, as has happened in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| and put it on a lot sideways where the end of the house with no windows, no doors is facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| And that's a horrible look to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| So, yes, when places like that are built, they're huge detriments to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| They totally change the flow of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| They stick out more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| They don't present any facing to the street that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| So there is a detriment when these are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| I think you've got a really good question about what happens in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| My sense from MPC is it might be done, it might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| I hope it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| One of our hopes is that saying that there is this moratorium encourages them to get it done more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| And I'm not sure what happens at the end of the 60 days if it's not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| At some level, I would love to say we're going to hold it until we've got the protections we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| But I'm not even going to say we can do that because it's possible they decide the IH1 doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| And the other thing that will work to change that is this new inner city residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| R1EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Well, no, it's the small version of the R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| R1EN is the large lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| This will be the small lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| And that's in the pipeline as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| I don't think that would be done in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| I don't know if Mr. Donaldson has an answer on the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| It's better than I can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| But I hope he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Well, I just have a problem tying somebody's hand for something that, you know, they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Like the person you suggested there that they're clearing off a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| I'm sure they had intentions on building something rather soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| And so big brothers coming in and saying, we don't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| My understanding of the law is that there are provisions that say if you started the use of a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| if you started expending money in the expectation of using the rights you currently have, we can't take them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| So at some level, that property might not be covered by this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| What if I bought a lot a year ago with intentions on building something on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| Would that get me out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| The fact that this one is being cleared is a significant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| And they might well already have a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| I mean, I haven't checked in a while on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| I think probably what we ought to do, because I talked to Mr. Swanson about this several weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| Maybe he could just go ahead and clarify that for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| because it's my understanding that there's not any intent to single out any particular properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| And sort of what Councilman Becker, you said, if someone has already begun the process of they built a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| they paid for a sign to put it out there, they, you know, have begun to expend money on the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| and we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| But I think what we're trying to do, and I'm not so sure 60 days is the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| I know we've already acted, and the MPC, I think, has been a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| I know they're working hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| But the intent is, you know, some of the suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| and sort of threatening things that potentially could go on there that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| we've already acted in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| and that we want to sort of make sure that this gets enacted before some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| that really threaten the character of the neighborhood take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| So, Mr. Swanson, would you just explain that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| What you're talking about is really not a statute or a provision of our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| The case law has simply pointed out in the past that when persons act based upon certain expectations of what their zoning are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3047)|
| 0:50:59| and they expend substantial sums of money in reliance upon that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| the municipality may be stopped at that point from taking adverse action to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| Certainly, they have the argument that there should be an estoppel at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| should the city enact a moratorium that would prohibit the issuance of a billing permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3076)|
| 0:51:24| after substantial sums of money or substantial work has been done in expectation of rights that are existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| And so the case law has suggested that there may be an estoppel in those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| So my advice to Mr. Becker and to Mr. Bailey was that if you're trying to stop something that is already underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3100)|
| 0:51:52| there certainly may be limitations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| You may not be able to stop something upon which substantial sums of money or substantial work has been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3114)|
| 0:52:02| whereas for those things have not yet commenced and for which there has been no substantial expenditure of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| and money, probably without question, then your moratorium would be effective to preclude those types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| I think you had a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Mr. Donaldson, can you tell us when we might expect something from you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| In order to achieve the 60-day response, we would have to have something on our October agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| And in order to do that, we might have to truncate any public participation process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| which is something that we don't like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| We could get something to you at your first November meeting, which would be more or less 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| by getting an item on the October agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| And we've been looking at this particular neighborhood since your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| and our initial feeling was that the existing IH1, which was established for the Oakwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| and Lincoln Park areas, Lonsdale, where there was a relatively homogenous form to the homes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| and it was easy then to create a set of design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| As we moved into the Edgewood Park area, there's less homogeneity, there's a bigger variety of building types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3196)|
| 0:53:26| and we found that the design standards that we had for the IH1 really didn't fit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| So we've started crafting new ones and have more or less blended it into this effort to create the new zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| Let me just say this, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| You know, when the last moratorium came about, there were some questions raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| and I think what we did is we shortened the time frame of the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| which then when that deadline came around, some things had developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| and the public was aware of what was going on and property owners and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| And then this council reacted to that, and I don't know that, you know, we need to go 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| because we could always review it after a certain number of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| and then decide what the reaction is and see if there's any sort of adverse reaction from property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| or, you know, more of the neighborhood people can get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| And certainly we don't want to we want the public participation process that the NPC is going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| So I think maybe we take this on sort of a meeting by meeting basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| So I'll just hear what my colleagues have to say and then maybe come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Councilman Holquist, then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Well, I think maybe the best recent model we have for this is the Cumberland Avenue moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3284)|
| 0:54:52| because what we had there was clearly a direction that we were going in, as we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3292)|
| 0:55:00| NPC already had the intent, at least, if they weren't already working on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| the new guidelines for the C-7 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| And we felt like it, this council felt like it was important enough to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| because there was a plan that had already been put out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| and those guidelines were supposed to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| that it was important to sort of secure what was there for a relatively short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| I can't remember what it was, if it was 60 days, but it was something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| Maybe it may have been longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| But anyway, this council agreed that that was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| put the moratorium in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| and recently approved on two readings those new guidelines for the C-7 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| in essence changing the C-7 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| And that will be in place until whatever time we go back and go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| and put form-based zoning in place for Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| But I think that's worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| As far as I know, it didn't really impinge on anybody to any extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| And, in fact, what we have on the agenda tonight is a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| adding to the C-7 district for a particular development that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| and these folks are very excited about what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| They're here tonight doing a development that fits those new guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| And so I think this approach makes a lot of sense because it's very different from the other one we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| This is we clearly know, I think, more or less where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| We may not know exactly what it's going to look like yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| just like we didn't know exactly what the Cumberland guidelines were going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| So I would argue in favor of this on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| Councilwoman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Since the time I've been on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| I have heartily supported overlays in neighborhoods where I felt like there has been good public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| allowing folks to be informed as to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I know there was a lot of controversy with the scenic drive overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I was supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| I supported the Holston Hills RER1EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| I plan on supporting the overlay on Highland Avenue later tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| However, I'm gun shy about an emergency moratorium because of not only what happened in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| but also what happened on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I voted for that emergency and then found later that there was a property owner that had something under development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| and it was a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| And, frankly, Mr. Becker, I've been listening to your preaching about emergencies over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| and I guess as much as I would like to protect this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| I'm gun shy of an emergency because I'm not convinced that everyone that might be affected by this has been informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| and I don't want to pass something that folks are unaware of and then get those phone calls tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| I'm going to go back to Councilman Becker, and then I'll come back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| I hear your concern, and I'm glad that my preaching is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| Hold off until the next meeting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| I guess one thing, I mean, Councilman Bailey actually suggested an interesting idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| One of the reasons with doing these on emergency is you do with an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| you give anybody who wants to slip in six or seven days' notice, and if you do it on two readings, you give them three weeks' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3506)|
| 0:58:35| So there's always this concern about is it effective to wait for a second reading, and I've actually been convinced that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3515)|
| 0:58:44| Mr. Bailey actually had an interesting suggestion of doing more of what we did with the Island Home is looking at a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| I guess we did a two-week moratorium there that actually allows us to get a protection in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| and then see are there people who are concerned about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| to be able to deal with those phone calls if they come in to choose a next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| Now, I actually do think there's been a tremendous amount of discussion within the neighborhood about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| a lot of awareness that is going on about the overlay and the need to protect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| But I would not feel bad if Mr. Bailey wants to make an amendment to move this to a two-week moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| that allows us to review it to see if there are problems that I'm not aware of now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| or other council members are not aware of at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I would like to get something in because I do worry about this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| It's diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| It is a neighborhood that I think is getting stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| It's got a new neighborhood association, a lot of good things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| And I've seen the impact that the double-wides, the really bad things can do in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| and I would hate to miss a chance to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Do we have anybody signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Nobody here present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| My take on this is, like I supported the moratorium in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| I'm not for blocking anybody's rights or preventing anybody from doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| but I don't see how two weeks would hurt at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| And what my intent is is to try to get some public participation going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| because I don't think anybody is purposely going to go in there and try to devalue the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| or build something that's not conducive to the area, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| I mean, I don't know who's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| I don't know who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| But, you know, there are certain folks that think that there are some potential problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| And so I'd like to just sort of put things on hold for a couple of weeks and let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| because this has been in the works for some time and the intent is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| It's not like we're doing anything that people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| that are reasonably taking a look at what's going on there should already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| So I'd like to amend this for a two-week moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| There's a motion and a second to amend for a two-week moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Let me just ask Mr. Swanson to make sure we're on par here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| Could I make a suggestion that you amend it to a 15-day moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| to avoid the argument that the two weeks runs out on the morning before your council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| so that if you want to extend it, you'll have the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| If you elect not to, it will run out the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| I'd like to change that from two weeks to 15-day moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| And I'll still second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Because I would just say that I have heard nothing except requests for support for this moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| and for this overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| So at this point I have no reason not to have supported the 60-day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| but that will give us an opportunity, as Councilman Bailey has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| to see if we hear anything to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Then the motion, the amendment is to have a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| Excuse me, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| I know the president of the Neighborhood Association came down to the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| and I don't know if Ellen Zavicka wants to say anything, but if she does, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| My name is Ellen Zavicka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| I live at 3118 Fairview Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| And just let me briefly preface my comments by noting that I do work on the staff of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| in transportation planning, but I'm here as a property owner in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| and as the president of the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| So I just want to obviously speak in support of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| We've been talking to Councilman Becker to try to get this in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| just because it has taken some time for MPC to evaluate the conditions of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| and amend the infill ordinance so that it fits more appropriately with the diversity of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| And I appreciate the concern that the council members have for the property rights of property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| As a property owner, we're all concerned with the value of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| and the possibility that it might be degraded by, you know, substandard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| until the time this infill overlay is put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| So I just wanted to urge the passage of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| My question really is for after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| I will come back to you after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| We're now voting on the motion to amend to 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| All those in favor of amending, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Now we're going back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Is your question for still after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Motion carries as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Mr. Donaldson, Councilman Becker alluded to the fact that you're working on some sort of inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| small lot, R1N zone of some nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| First, I've heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Who asked for you to work on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And I'd like to be briefed on that as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Can you tell me where we're at in that process and what you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Well, that effort dates back to when we initiated what turned out to be the R1EN zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3853)|
| 1:04:21| We talked about creating a family of zones that more reflected the actual development patterns of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3861)|
| 1:04:29| basically small, medium, and large with the longstanding R1 fitting the medium slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3869)|
| 1:04:38| The R1EN has kind of fit the large lot slot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| and we've been working on one to reflect the smaller lot development in the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3881)|
| 1:04:52| which are typically done on a 40- or a 50-foot wide lot basis, which are illegal under R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| We've been talking about it for a while, and we're finally there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| The Band-Aid approach was the IH overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| and now we've been working to create basically a replacement zone district for the R1 in these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Yeah, I'd like to just be balling in the loop on that when you get a chance to update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| And the reason I ask that is, you know, we pass a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| We've been doing an awful lot, you know, the last couple of years about our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| and putting in a lot of different kinds of new zones and new requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| and I'm beginning to get a little concerned about the negative impact it could have on first-time home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3936)|
| 1:05:44| and some low-income ownership in some communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| because some of these zones and some of the things that we tend to do may increase the cost of trying to build a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| and try to get somebody in that first-time home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| So we've got to find our balance there to make sure that we don't go too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| and make it to a degree where it's going to be very difficult for some folk to try to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| and for some agencies to help folk get started, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| So that's my concern, and as we go down through the process, I'm sure we can figure out our balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| But I don't want us to get out of balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Councilman Alvarez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Vice Mayor Brown, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| There are some things, if you have design standards or, you know, regulations of any kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| that would be in one of these overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| There are some that might really impact the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| There are others that very well might not impact the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| but would just cause them to fit in more appropriately and fit into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| I think we've seen, certainly in Councilman Becker's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| I've noticed on Chickamauga and some other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| houses that were built that all they had to do was take a block out of the foundation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| one course out of the foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| and they wouldn't have stuck up and looked inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| and it probably wouldn't have been any more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Are we going to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Excuse me, we did vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Article V, Section 21, residential occupancy standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| adding newly created zone districts to residential occupancy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| 12C is an ordinance to close the remaining park portion of an unnamed alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| running between Sunrise Street and Elm Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Myra Pate, slash, City of Knoxville Applicants, Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| She didn't sign up both councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| You can come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| My name is Myra Pate, and I own the property actually at 817 Bel Air Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| Right now, I need to give you some background so you'll understand where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| In January 7th, my house burned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| I have jumped through more hoops than I can imagine that I had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| to get to where I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| And this is the last stand before I can build the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| I have my daughter, myself, her husband, and three children living in a two-bedroom house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| Not a good situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| The only place we had, though, because my cousin let us live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| And we need this house to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| We need something to happen to where we don't have to wait this extra two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| You know, emergency or something, because the people beside us on the right side, they're dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4141)|
| 1:09:09| They don't care what we do with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| People on the left side signed off on it, and he was glad to sign off on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| because he wants his part of that park back too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| And the other half of the park, it's already went back to its owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| And all I'm asking is that if you just don't care, please, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| let me just go ahead and start tomorrow putting my property together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| and surveying it and getting my contractors so that we can get in this house by Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Two weeks makes such a difference on something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Yeah, I'll give my position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| As Ms. Roddy pointed out, I'm a preacher against emergency ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| I think there is a value in a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| As it's currently set up, this wouldn't take effect for 31 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| What I would be willing to do if this will help, it will take 17 days off that, is by eliminating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| We actually have not only two readings, but after the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| we say you have to wait 17 more days before it goes into effect, which I don't understand why we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| But I'd be willing to actually take off that 17-day wait, which would move it forward not until tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| but would move it forward 17 days from what it would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| I hope that can help in your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| And I'll make that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Let me go to Councilman Hall first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Oh, actually, you did make a motion, so I need to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Yeah, we actually did vote before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| I want to make a motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| There's a motion and a second to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| And I have a question pertinent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Would that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| That would help a lot because, see, what we would do is we would call the city is building our house for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| We have plans made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| This house is going up as soon as I can get it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| Three days, we can have it surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| Two weeks after that, we can have our contractor picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| It will start within 30 days, well, two weeks and three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| From today, if I can get it okayed, you know that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| I'd like to make a motion to reconsider it as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4306)|

| 1:11:48| We have to vote on the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| The first, yeah, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| First, we have to vote on the motion to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| All those in favor of reconsidering, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4318)|

| 1:12:02| Now, the motion to approve is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| As an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| As an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Now, there's a motion by Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Catch me if I drive us in the ditch here, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| To be effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| To be effective immediately is what Mr. Hall's motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| It's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| And it's a second from Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| That's an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Mr. Becker, this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Have you spoken with the other property owners that are affected by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| Do we have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| I mean, it's a closure, and I think everybody's been informed legally about this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| That would be the case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| Other than your moral opposition to emergency immediate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| any reason why you would need to oppose this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Other than my really good moral reasons against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| No, no, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| And I think, you know, it's entirely possible when the vote is called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| I'll be studying the ceiling and unaware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| This is a truly unique situation, as I'm sure the applicant understands better than anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| And it's hard to tell based on this rather hard to read map that MPC is included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| But this is an alleyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| Apparently it was maybe never opened as an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| but it was a paper alley at least that in the middle of the block expands into a very large rectangle that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4416)|
| 1:13:47| I can clear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| Roughly four lots plus long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| And then, you know, it's standard alley width on either end of that where it intersects the side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| It's just one of these bizarre things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| Who knows how it got that way or why it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| But it's very strange, and it seems like it would behoove us to fix it in an expeditious manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| There's a motion on the floor to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| We're ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Everybody voting in favor of the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Heard eight ayes and one looking at the stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| Now, back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Hopefully that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| That helps me very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| And to clear your question up, that was a park that was donated by each of the people that lived on the side of the alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4476)|
| 1:14:45| And it was supposed to be materialized as a park through the city, but it didn't materialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| And so we just . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| That's why it looks crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| We maintained it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| And that's the reason it looks so crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| We just did away with a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| 12D is an ordinance approving the request of Andrews Properties, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| for an amendment to the Southwest County Sector Plan from Mixed Uses, Commercial Office, Medium Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| and Low Density Residential, and Slope Protection to Mixed Uses, Commercial Office, and Medium Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| subject to the Metropolitan Planning Commission's approval of any construction on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| including a comprehensive development plan for the entire 105 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| showing compliance with any conditions included as part of the rezoning approved for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| located on the south side of Kingston Pike, south of Marketplace Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| west of North Cedar Bluff Road, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Mr. Perry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| There will be discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| There will be discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| We have three signed up to speak in favor and three signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| Would you like to hear them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| The first lined up to speak in favor is Mr. Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| After him will be Kim Trent and then Frank Guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Mayor, members of City Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr. speaking on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| We have here a rather interesting piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| It's 100 acres in the center of West Knoxville almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| It is right on the south side of Marketplace Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| This property came on the market last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| There was a life tenant who died several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| The owners of the property, who are a number of heirs, are represented by Mr. Mike Price and Oliver Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| Raymond Higgins, Raymond, raise your hand, here from Atlanta with Andrews Properties, has a contract on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4604)|
| 1:16:53| He has engaged several developers to do a mixed-use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| One is Frank Guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Frank, raise your hand, who has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| He has recently completed the Dean Hill Shopping Center development here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| Jerica Vann, who is from Nebraska, will do a senior housing component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| Harold Cannon is overall engineer for the project, and Barbara and McMurray are our architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4636)|
| 1:17:25| This is an interesting piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| At the front, on the west side, there is a historic house that was built apparently in the 1840s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| It is presently on Knox Heritage's endangered 15 list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| After obtaining control of the property, Mr. Andrews assembled the team I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| and we have had a number of meetings that bring us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| We have met on several occasions with people in the adjoining residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4674)|
| 1:18:01| The most recent meeting occurring last Thursday, and I will come back to that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| We have met with Councilman Pelow, the councilman from that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| We have met with MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| Many of these meetings occurred long before the rezoning application started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| We learned a lot in the early meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| We learned that the sector plan for this 100 acres included mixed uses, commercial, office, residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4704)|
| 1:18:34| low-density and medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| We learned that the house and its preservation was absolutely essential to any use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4718)|
| 1:18:47| We learned that neighboring residential areas did not want vehicular access into their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4727)|
| 1:18:56| We learned that any road work should go through the center of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| Taking all that into account, we had filed for a mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| The front 40 acres plan commercial, MPC recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| That is a plan zone and would require that any development plans come back for approval before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4753)|
| 1:19:22| that covenants and restrictions be developed for it, and it be presented at a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| The office, the biggest component of that is senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| I guess they're counting on my generation to move in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| But at any rate, that would require a use on review before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| We have asked for plan residential on the back part or the south part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| and that, again, would have to come back to MPC for review and public hearing on our development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| and also with covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| MPC approved unanimously the request for plan residential on the front 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4802)|
| 1:20:12| I mean, excuse me, plan commercial on the front, office on about 20 acres in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| and plan residential in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| We have also gone to the Historic Zoning Commission to ask for H1 overlay on the Sherrill House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4822)|
| 1:20:32| It is in sound shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| We have enlisted the help of Knox Heritage and Ann Bennett with MPC to look at that and help us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4834)|
| 1:20:43| We are requesting H1 overlay on that portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| We have heard from the adjoining residential people that setbacks are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| To that end, meetings were held last Thursday between the various developers with adjoining residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4857)|
| 1:21:06| We had agreed before today that on the plan residential on the east, west, and south, completely on the periphery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4866)|
| 1:21:15| we would leave a 50-foot undisturbed border where we abut the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| And we would leave it undisturbed or put berming, fencing, and additional vegetation in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| depending on the wishes of the property owners and approval of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| which will ultimately be required since this is a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| We did likewise with the O1 zone, 50 feet undisturbed, an additional 25 of no build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4897)|
| 1:21:46| Again, with the caveat that if the adjoining property owners wanted berming, fencing, or additional vegetation, we would work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| On the commercial, we had initially agreed to 50 feet, 25 feet undisturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4914)|
| 1:22:03| and 25 feet no build for a 50-foot peripheral boundary on that where we abut residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| Part of the commercial property abuts an adjoining shopping center on the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| Frank Gass received a call, he is the developer of the commercial project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| from two landowners with whom he met last Thursday asking him to consider a 50-foot undisturbed buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4942)|
| 1:22:36| a landscape buffer, and a 25% no build area in addition to that for 75 feet where the commercial abuts residential on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4956)|
| 1:22:49| These are people he met with last week and he agreed with them this afternoon to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| We're here asking that on the plan 12-D you approve that, the amendment to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4975)|
| 1:23:08| and one-year plan that you approve that as MPC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| I'm going to ask Mr. Gass to hand out a proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| Would you pass this to the city council members, Frank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| On 12-E, which would set forth the agreements that I just set out on buffering and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5001)|
| 1:23:34| making those a condition of the zoning so that all the way around where we have adjoining residentially zoned and residentially used property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5014)|
| 1:23:50| which is all of the property on the west and the south and most of the property on the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| that we have basically a 50-foot non-disturbed zone, landscape zone, whatever you call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5038)|
| 1:24:07| where we would work with the neighbors to agree on leaving it as it is, fencing, berming, or whatever agreement is reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5047)|
| 1:24:18| basically depending on a consensus from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| We also ask that you approve our request of nine units per acre for the planned residential part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5062)|
| 1:24:36| And I am handing out a survey that Raymond Higgins did of typical density of apartments that have been approved in the city in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5076)|
| 1:24:49| As you can see, nine units per acre is less than all of the recently approved ones, including,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5089)|
| 1:24:59| and I'm familiar with one, Heritage Lake at Westland Drive, which is at the intersection of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| and interstate or Pellissippi Parkway, which is at 13 units per acre, 13.7 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5106)|
| 1:25:15| That property has adjacent to it, after the apartments were built, very high-dollar homes being built right adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5115)|
| 1:25:26| That is an Oliver Smith development also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| So I would request that you all approve 12D as approved by MPC and 12E with our proposed amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5129)|
| 1:25:44| which basically adds protections to the MPC action to the adjoining residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| and allows us one more unit per acre on the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| And I would mention that's about 39 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| The present approval is 320 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| It would add 29 to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| And that is our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Thank you, Mr. Mayor and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Did Mr. Guest want to speak as well or do you speak for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| I know I have Ms. Trent for later, but did Mr. Guest want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| Ms. Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5185)|
| 1:26:39| Hi, I'm Kim Trent, executive director of Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| I live at 2905 Fountain Park Boulevard in the beautiful North Hills neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| I'm here on behalf of Knox Heritage because, as Mr. Seymour had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| the Walker-Sherrill House is on Knox Heritage's fragile 15 list of the most endangered properties in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| Knox County, and we have been very interested in its preservation and protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| And so I'm here to speak specifically to the historic overlay zoning, which Knox Heritage strongly favors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| I'd also like to thank Councilwoman Pelo for her leadership in this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| and bringing that issue to the table right at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| As we've noted, the house was built in 1849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| It is perhaps the most important existing example of federal style architecture existing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5238)|
| 1:27:26| It's a rare thing that we have these left, and it's an important part of our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| as well as its owner originally was Dr. William J. Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| And some of you may be familiar with his brother, Dr. Harry Baker, whose house down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| the Baker-Peters House, is still standing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| We are definitely in favor of historic overlay zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| We found Mr. Higgins and his development team to be very sensitive to the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| preserving views from Kingston Pike to the house, and doing a sensitive reuse for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| I wish all developers had been as easy to work with as Mr. Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| They came to the table ready to talk about the importance of that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| and we've had a very good relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| So we are in favor of preservation of the house and historic overlay zoning that will do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| and glad that the development came forth that produced that result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| I'm Frank Guess with Asics and Barnhart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| and I think that Mr. Seymour explained pretty well what our—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| If you could give us your address, too, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| It's 25 Technology Parkway, Suite 201, Atlanta, Georgia 30092.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| He pretty well summarized the changes that we have agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| as far as the buffers that were made about 3 o'clock this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| and when I did receive a call from two of the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| within the 12 or 14 people that are adjacent to the retail portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| and they were requesting that the setback provision be an increase from 50 feet to 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5339)|
| 1:29:08| The building setback provision was not as important to them as the buffering area to be extended from—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5348)|
| 1:29:18| I think it was passed at 15 feet was the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| and I had agreed with the residents, adjoining residents, to increase that to 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| and the two people that contacted me today were asking that we increase the landscape area to 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5371)|
| 1:29:42| and that's what I agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| And then subsequent to the vote tonight, we have a meeting scheduled sometime in the first week of October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5385)|
| 1:29:54| where these adjoining neighbors will meet with me again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| and then we will discuss the type of buffering—different buffering alternatives that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5398)|
| 1:30:06| So that's pretty much where it was left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| And the neighbors—the two people that did contact me—concluded and told me that if I would agree to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| that it was their belief that the remaining neighbors would be in favor of that, and that would suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| We do have some folks signed up to speak against as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| Mr. John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| Mr. Mayor, Members of Council, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5438)|
| 1:30:48| The applicant here has spoken of both of these matters together, i.e., the plan amendment as well as the rezoning matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5448)|
| 1:31:01| and I suppose I would follow that in similar fashion, even though the 12E has not been yet read into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5461)|
| 1:31:14| for the sake of not having to be up here any more than I usually spend up here, which is as long as you all will give me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5474)|
| 1:31:25| I want to make sure I understand that on Item 12D, and perhaps this is for Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| that I do understand correctly that the plan amendment carries with it the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| or the requirement for a comprehensive development plan approval for the entire site to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| and dealt with by MPC in addition to whatever uses on review may be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| That's the recommendation that came from the commission included the phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| including a comprehensive development site plan for the entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Then most of my comments are going to be related to the Item 12E, which is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5525)|
| 1:32:13| And once again, to start with, if I may, a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| I assume that what was passed to city council was a copy of what you gave me, Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| earlier before the start of tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I gave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| It's the same one I gave you a few moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5550)|
| 1:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Mr. Lowell indicates he wants to speak on Item D first, which is what you do have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5562)|
| 1:32:51| which is the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| So I'm going to yield and I'll get back up here and talk about 12E and when it finishes on 12D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5573)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Mr. Lowell, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| I'm Larry Lowell, 224 Norfolk, Knoxville, just outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5586)|
| 1:33:16| I'm not going to follow my prepared remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| In fact, I really wasn't going to say anything tonight until this resolution popped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| So good evening, Mayor and city councilmen and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5608)|
| 1:33:35| I am chairman of the Planning and Development Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| representing five subdivisions of 500 homes surrounding the Sherrill property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| of which 53 have their backyards abutting to it and another 60 are across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5624)|
| 1:33:54| So before us is the amendment of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| I'm going to spend some time talking about that to make your job easier on the rezoning vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5639)|
| 1:34:08| Just as a reminder, you have five total minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| You should have been at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| We spoke for an hour on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| I am a retired process design and construction engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| and I have designed and built an office and a warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| and other projects totaling over $20 million in my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| You kind of have to ignore that my last job was for Enron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5672)|
| 1:34:40| As Councilman Barbara Pillow said, sector plans are a public process to reach a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| In 2005, with me as the point person, our community of homeowners went through the process with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5686)|
| 1:34:56| to amend the southwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| And so they gradually convinced us that a town center approach with a commercial in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5701)|
| 1:35:09| office in the middle, planned residential in the back, low density, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| one to six in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| We thought it was one to three, but that's just in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| So that was written into the plan in 2005 and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| It was a long six-month road to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| But generally, the homeowners realized that this property would be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| and this was the prelude to that coming in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| And we felt that the town center project concept was a good one, and we could abide by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5744)|
| 1:35:53| So at the MPC meeting, and in your packet of handouts, you have up to 58 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| some of them duplicates on 12D and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| And I have watched the video with the minutes in hand, and we still don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| But I can tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Oh, that's on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Okay, I'm just talking about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| So where do we stand on the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| We're disappointed, but we're hoping that we could work with the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| and address the concerns of noise and congestion in the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| So, in conclusion, for 12D, the proposed development is quite complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| The property is difficult to build on, over 35 percent, over 30 percent slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| and south of the petrochemical pipeline, it's even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| There are 53 single-family residences bordering the property of homes 20 to 44 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5805)|
| 1:36:53| There are 53 single-family residences bordering the property of homes 20 to 44 years in age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| This is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| None of the developers have ever tried to develop a property in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| with so many homeowners so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5825)|
| 1:37:15| Okay, I'm just consoling my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| That's all I have to say at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Now to discussion, then, of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Anyone have a comment on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| Mr. Peeler, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Oh, excuse me, there is a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| There's a two-minute reply from those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| I just want to reaffirm the MPC has required, as part of the amendment to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5858)|
| 1:37:49| that we develop a comprehensive master plan for the whole project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| and we are in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| I think that is unique to this development, but we agree that is a good part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5879)|
| 1:38:07| and we are going forward with our architects and engineers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| And we'll be presenting it to the property owners around this development, as well as MPC, early in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5891)|
| 1:38:21| Mr. Gass mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Okay, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| I guess just quickly, there's always a challenge when we do the sector plan and the zoning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| My sense is we're going to have some discussion about the zoning when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| That light's off then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Seeing no lights, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| 12E is an ordinance to rezone property from A1, General Agricultural District, to PC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| retail and office park, approximately 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| PC1 slash H1, historic overlay, including the design guidelines, O1, office medical and related services, 26 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| and RP1, planned residential district, at up to eight dwelling units per acre on 39 acres south of the gas easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| Property located on the south side of Kingston Pike, south of Marketplace Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| west of North Cedar Bluff Road, Andrews Property, Inc., applicant second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| And then, Mayor Haslund, I further move that we amend the MPC action as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| and I would like to read that amendment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| To approve PC1, retail and office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| with the condition that there will be a 75-foot no-build area from the adjacent residentially zoned properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| with 50 feet to be undisturbed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| unless by agreement between the applicant and adjoining residential owners with the approval of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| a berm or fence or additional vegetation is placed in the undisturbed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| giving a total of 75-foot building separation from the adjoining residentially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| Furthermore, I move that the action of the MPC be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| so that the H1 overlay covers that portion of the Sherrill House and surrounding property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| that was recommended for the H1 overlay by the Knoxville Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| To approve O1, office medical and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| as recommended by the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| with the condition that there be a 50-foot undisturbed tree and landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| unless by agreement between the applicant and adjoining residential owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| and with the approval of MPC, a berm or fence or additional landscaping is placed in the undisturbed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| with a 25-foot building setback from the undisturbed buffer along the edge of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| giving a total building separation of 75 feet from the adjoining residentially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6063)|
| 1:41:11| I move that the RP1 planned residential, as approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| be amended to allow up to nine dwelling units per acre on 39 acres south of the gas easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6076)|
| 1:41:24| with the condition that a 50-foot undisturbed tree and landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| unless by agreement between the applicant and the adjoining residential owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| and with the approval of MPC, a berm or fence or additional landscaping is placed in the undisturbed area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| with a 25-foot building setback from the undisturbed buffer along the edge of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| giving a total building separation of 75 feet from the adjoining residentially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| Okay. That was a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Okay. Now we're going to go to discussion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| The same folks had signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| I'm not sure who wants to speak again and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Mr. King asked me if I wanted to say anything before he started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| I just want to second the comments we made at the outset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| and add that Mr. Lowell mentioned lighting, dumpsters, and issues like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| We will begin addressing those issues specifically in the master plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| which we will be going through with MPC and which will be presented to all of the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| and the residentially zoned properties around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| as well as a number of other issues that have been raised in our meetings with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| Once we have the zoning in place, we will go forward and further refine those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6165)|
| 1:42:52| and get further input from our neighbors so we can address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| That was in addition to what I wanted to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Yes, just a quick question on the increased density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| This is an increase in the number of units you all have been planning for the apartments, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| And that MPC approved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| Well, but even what you've been planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| because my understanding is you all were comfortable with the MPC decision, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| No, we asked for nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| That was our original application was for nine units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| and we would like to proceed forward with nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| That's 38 or 39 units more than what MPC staff recommended and what MPC approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6209)|
| 1:43:40| And with the change on the outline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| we further refined the area for the H1 overlay on the Sherrill House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| which we look forward to working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| As I told the Historic Zoning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| we will probably use that as a signature for this project as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Before Mr. King gets up, Ms. Trent or Mr. Guest, I'm assuming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| you don't want to speak again or you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| There was one additional thing that we talked about in our meeting with the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| that I'd like to put on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| was that MPC, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| stated a condition of an additional right-in, right-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| and where we had the right-in, right-out drawn on our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| was too close to the western border of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| And so I stated that I would move that as close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| move it further east as far as I could with the MPC allowing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6279)|
| 1:44:48| or the state DOT, I guess that's a state road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| So that was the only other thing I failed to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Mr. King or Mr. Lowell, whoever wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| We'll reverse, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Mr. Mayor and City Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| What am I going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| Lots of things to be said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| We kind of gave a free pass on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| The sector plan being overridden was a major disappointment to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| The application for the zoning request asked for nine units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| This is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| When we divided the number of units proposed in the June 21st meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| the August 2nd meeting, the August 9th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| and the September 6th meeting, we get 7.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| And I can do math without a calculator, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| I'm from the old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Mike Carberry from MPC also realized that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| and that's why the plan was amended to eight units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| That satisfies their original proposal of ten buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| Nine would allow them to do 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| I've never been associated with a project so long that the buildings still aren't sighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| either in the commercial or in the residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| The Senior Independent Living Center is sighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| thanks to good work by Jerry Kevan and Cannon and Cannon doing the topographical analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6380)|
| 1:46:31| So in your folder, there are two pictures that I provided each one of you with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6391)|
| 1:46:40| In your folder, this is separate from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| there's a picture of the zoning regulation for the Sherrill property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| One has red on it, and the other one is this one down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| It has green and yellow on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Why am I showing you this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| The Sherrill property is A-1 until this zoning gets passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| To the left is Seven Oaks East, R-A-E, the most restrictive zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| residential zoning in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| Along the south side is Statesview, R-A, residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| the second most restrictive in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| On the east is Cedar Bluff, R-B, the third most restrictive in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6438)|
| 1:47:29| So what is R-A-E zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| Reading from Article 5, Section 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| Number one, general description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| The zone provides only for single-family residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| at low population densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| These areas are intended to be defined and protected from the enroachment of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| not performing a function necessary to the single-family residential environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| Let me read that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| To be defined and protected from the enroachment of uses not performing a function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| necessary to the single-family residential environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| We were expecting six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| MPC approved eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| With a lot of discussion, that was a bitter pill to swallow, but we swallowed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| And now the developers want nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| So that's strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| It's the original application of ten buildings of about 30 units, which requires 7.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6509)|
| 1:48:35| They always were going to do 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| I could never get an explanation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| I've asked it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6518)|
| 1:48:51| So we're asking you to have sympathy for the homeowners, concern for the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| This project is a major decision, maybe the most important decision you'll make this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| And it needs – and I'll be back in two weeks, and I'll give you more information then and before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6543)|
| 1:49:11| So all the berming and the buffering, most of that was on the drawings and verbally agreed to by the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6551)|
| 1:49:22| except we were only getting 50 feet in the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| And I had a lot of unhappy homeowners in the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| I live in the middle, so I get the best of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| Senior Independent Living Center, you'll get your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Senior Independent Living Center is 175 feet from my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| So in conclusion, and I've polled the southern property owners this afternoon when I learned this resolution was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6581)|
| 1:49:49| So in conclusion, we do not support and are vehemently opposed to increasing the density from eight to nine units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6589)|
| 1:49:57| in the PR1 apartment development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| There is no justification for this increase in traffic and congestion of additional two buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| to raise the total apartment complex to approaching 351 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| We feel that 300 is too much, but that's what the county commissioners approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| Twenty more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| One further thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Although the final vote was 12-0, only two of the seven recommendations by MPC were attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6620)|
| 1:50:29| And the vote was 6-6 with the chairman voting, which is a tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| which denied passing the zoning with the MPC recommendations attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| Who knows better than the MPC what the homeowners want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| And we had worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| May it please the council, I think I want to correct one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| Mr. Lowell said at least one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| It's not 50 feet on the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I understand it is now 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| The building separation or however you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| I'm here on behalf of residents and property owners of the subdivisions, Cedar Bluffs, Seven Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| East and West, Statesview and Wedgeview Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| Having already dealt with the issue of the amendment to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| my comments now are directed toward the rezoning that you have before you already in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6694)|
| 1:51:44| And my first point would be to seek clarification from Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| As I heard the motion made as it relates to the 01 portion of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6711)|
| 1:52:01| we have the 75-foot building separation as described in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| I had understood from Mr. Seymour that there was likewise agreement on their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| or willingness on their part to have what had been part of the recommendation of MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6734)|
| 1:52:23| that he agrees that there would be a two-story height limitation on those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6743)|
| 1:52:30| within 100 feet of the property boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| And I would ask that before the vote is taken that that amendment be further amended, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| to include that two-story height limitation within 100 feet of the property boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6760)|
| 1:52:48| east and west property boundaries of the 01 zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6768)|
| 1:52:57| I believe otherwise there ought to be perhaps a clarification so that everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6777)|
| 1:53:10| The motion as I heard it, as it relates to the PC part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6790)|
| 1:53:21| we have our building separation area from the adjoining residentially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6801)|
| 1:53:30| I understand that in the PC one that would be along the eastern and western boundaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| with the exception of that small strip at the front where you have a shopping center adjoining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| With regard to the 01, we are talking about, again, that building separation of the feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6822)|
| 1:53:52| as described by Councilman Pelow from the says adjoining residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| And once again, we are talking about the east and west boundaries of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6838)|
| 1:54:07| And as it relates to the RP1 zoning classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| when we talk about that building separation from the adjoining residentially zoned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| we're talking about the east and west boundaries as well as the southern boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Then I think what my remaining comments will relate to will be the issue that, as I see it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6869)|
| 1:54:38| is sort of what we have come down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| I mentioned the people that I'm here representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| and the fact that we didn't request that they come here in a show of force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| does not mean they are not intensely interested in this proposed development and how it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| It is a major, major development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| In a sense, it is three developments going on by three different entities on the same piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6899)|
| 1:55:06| and it has been a complicated and complex process up to this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| and I have only been involved since fairly recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| What you have now is distillation down to what's now being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6918)|
| 1:55:27| We have some protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| We have some protections now at this stage of rezoning and some, if you will, buffer areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6929)|
| 1:55:39| But if you stop and think about it, what you have is a very, very intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| There's an intensity of utilization of this property that is very, very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| It is not like going and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| here is a 10- or a 12-acre or even a 15-acre piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| and let's put apartments on it, and you get it approved at 12 or 15 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| You're putting apartments at the back end of a very intense commercial utilization on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| and office utilization in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| which includes an independent living facility as well as office structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| with the residential coming in the rear portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| The more units you add per acre, the more intensity of utilization you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6984)|
| 1:56:31| the more traffic you will generate, the more daily traffic trips you will generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| And, yes, we raised that issue about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| It was raised at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| They said eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| The developer now says nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| The consequence is for the people who live surrounding this is going from eight to nine units to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| adds two buildings to that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| At least one, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| I believe the word was perhaps two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| I don't know whether you have it or not, but this is the portion that's that residential portion, the top of this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| Currently, those 10 buildings are laid out in sort of pod-like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| There's not a whole lot of space left to put another two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| The residents have a reluctance, if you will, to go along with that kind of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7048)|
| 1:57:39| given the other intensity of utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| They asked respectfully that this body consider the recommendations of the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7063)|
| 1:57:50| and the decision of MPC that set the density at eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7070)|
| 1:57:58| We've, as I said, negotiated and gotten down to this distillation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7078)|
| 1:58:06| That's their request at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| We'd ask that you give it favorable consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| And I would ask that that one point that Mr. Seymour agrees with likewise be added to the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7093)|
| 1:58:21| and that it be otherwise amended to reduce from nine dwelling units per acre down to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Councilwoman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Yes, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| A request has been made that we further amend my motion, my amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson or Mr. Kizer, one, to assist me in how we best go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7118)|
| 1:58:46| What is pending before the council at the moment is a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| You can simply, by friendly amendment, amend your motion to amend, if your second will accept it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7131)|
| 1:58:59| to add whatever provision it is that they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| I'm not sure I'm altogether clear what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Well, I believe, if I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| It needs to be articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| If I understand correctly, you would like it designated that the RP1 section will be limited to two stories, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7150)|
| 1:59:21| No, it's the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| Oh, the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| I would add a sentence at the end of the second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| Furthermore, that any buildings within 100 feet of the adjacent residentially zoned property be limited to two stories in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7169)|
| 1:59:39| Mr. King, will that meet your request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| Ms. Mitchell, did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| You can furnish that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Then I so amend my amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| I need my second to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| And now I'd really like, if it's, Mr. Seymour, did you have something else you needed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7195)|
| 2:00:04| Could I use 30 seconds of the two-minute rebuttal just to point out something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| Or I'll sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| No, you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| I would like to point out that the Cedar Bluff property to the east of the shopping center is zoned RB under the county zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7216)|
| 2:00:25| That allows up to 12 units per acre in an unregulated zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| All you have to do is go out and get a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| Granted, the homes there now are single-family homes, but that could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| To the south, at the southeast corner, this property is zoned up to 12 units per acre as planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7239)|
| 2:00:48| We realize the intensity of the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| We've been working with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| They want interior connections, pedestrian, vehicular, and everything, and pedestrian especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7252)|
| 2:01:00| And we're working very seriously on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| They have also asked us to have a pedestrian connection into both adjoining neighborhoods to the east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7263)|
| 2:01:15| Well, that's what MPC asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| That will come at the master plan stage, pedestrian access only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| Ms. Peeler, are you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| I did have my light on, unless, Mr. Becker, you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| I had a question for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| Mr. Seymour, I know the amendment that Ms. Peeler has is an agreement that you feel you've worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| There's a lot of concern about the nine versus eight units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| And I just want to ask, if this is amended down to eight units per acre, would you want to renegotiate the whole deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7305)|
| 2:01:58| I mean, is it something that or does everything all stand and we can fight over that one point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| If we can fight over that one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| my clients have made these agreements with the surrounding property owners and intend to stand by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Ms. Peeler, would someone like to recognize the speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| Thank you, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| Sir, you just need to realize that you need to, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| the discussions over the council member has to ask you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| Two property owners called him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| There is no consensus among the homeowners to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| So they want us to trade two apartment buildings for 25 additional feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Mr. Becker, I'll respond to some of these comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Mr. Becker, are you satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| I just want to comment that this has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| I know it's felt very long to the neighborhood because I think it was a couple years ago that I was first called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7372)|
| 2:02:59| when someone was interested in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| And I'm just going to have to be a little personal about this because I've known this property all of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| I grew up on Kingston Pike just a few miles west of there in a home that was built in the 1830s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| And I knew the Sherrill family well who lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| And that home has always been very special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| It was a much more attractive home than ours, and it just always caught my eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| So when I knew this was going to be developed and was informed that it was city property, I felt a real ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7410)|
| 2:03:39| I just felt compelled to be involved, even though, of course, my obligation is really to the city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7419)|
| 2:03:48| But I had promised the county residents who surround this area that I would be their advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| It has been ‑‑ I have spent a great deal of emotional time considering how best to develop this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7435)|
| 2:04:09| and how best to see it utilized in terms of the cities realizing something from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| but also the residents of that area and what it means to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| The first developers that looked at the property, I felt very discouraged about ever arriving at anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| that would work for any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| When these folks came on the scene, I was asked to meet with them, and it has been a very interesting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| My very first efforts were to advocate for the community, because I knew there were certain requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7479)|
| 2:04:50| they were going to have to be able to continue to live there, enjoy their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| and enjoy what, for years, has been their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| I also am very aware that this was going to be developed at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| So looking for a developer who was going to be sensitive to this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| and sensitive to the city and the possibilities there was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| Our very first meeting was very encouraging, because the developers made it clear from the outset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| they wanted very much to be able to work with the people in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| I know many people have emailed me and corresponded with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| and they just don't really want the property developed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| They love it the way it is, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| But as Mr. Lowell said, the understanding is we know something is going to happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| so let's let the best thing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| And even up until today, we were negotiating for this 75-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7546)|
| 2:05:54| And today we spent a great deal of time trying to work toward that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| I feel the developers have been very generous in actually reengineering their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7559)|
| 2:06:06| And in doing so, I think they became aware that there had been a lot of compromise on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7566)|
| 2:06:15| And I think the request for the nine units, which they had originally hoped to achieve there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| has come as a result of their efforts to work with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| in trying to mitigate the concerns about the very closeness of this commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7588)|
| 2:06:35| and retail structures to some of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| I don't know that I've ever been involved in the six years I've been on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| where developers were willing to meet and sit down and meet with each of the individual homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| I have to really thank you for that and respect you for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| and I know that those homeowners have appreciated that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| It was an excellent meeting that the entire community held at, I can't remember the name of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7619)|
| 2:07:05| but at the church that evening, and I think there were about 100 people there, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| And the plans were well laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| There were good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| And when I realized where we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| I can see so many considerations that have been made for some of the concerns that were expressed that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7639)|
| 2:07:27| So I just really want to thank the neighborhood for coming tonight, because it's been a long evening for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| and I appreciate your interest and we understand your interest and your concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7654)|
| 2:07:42| I believe that MPC has an excellent process for reviewing this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| and for making sure that many of your concerns that you had originally were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| In discussing the nine units, when I learned about the request to change the number from eight to nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7672)|
| 2:08:04| I had to consider how that is going to impact all of you sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| And, you know, I just see less impact to the neighborhood than I do to the development itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7690)|
| 2:08:20| because there is this one way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| We have no streets that lead into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| There is no access to or from this development into your neighborhood, into any of the neighborhoods that are adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7708)|
| 2:08:37| All of the people who live in the planned residential will be entering from the central entry into the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7717)|
| 2:08:47| into the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| So I see that impact as being an impact that is going to be borne by the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7729)|
| 2:08:55| because it is going to have to move through the different phases of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| So I do not see that that is going to be an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| There is one other very positive feature about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| The city is not being asked to put any money into this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7750)|
| 2:09:16| The developer is going to, I believe, isn't that correct, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| And I think that is we have so many people coming to us asking for tax, increment financing, other types of tax relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7761)|
| 2:09:31| And this is something that the developers are willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| They are willing to bear the cost of the compromises that have been reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| And I see that as a very big plus for this city and a very favorable move on the part of the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7778)|
| 2:09:48| And, of course, the house, which I mentioned early on, is of great importance to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7788)|
| 2:09:56| And we kind of talked for a long time in that first meeting about what the proposals were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7796)|
| 2:10:04| but nobody wanted to mention the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| And I remember after about three hours saying it is time to talk about the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| because that is really a crucial aspect to whether or not I personally could support the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7812)|
| 2:10:21| And I think you all will be so glad to know that you have all participated in saving that beautiful old home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| And there are plans for that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| It won't sit there empty and deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| So those are just some of the comments and some of the thoughts that are in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| But I want to thank everybody who has worked so hard to try to bring not what everybody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7837)|
| 2:10:46| that we could bring out of this and still all be able to shake hands at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7846)|
| 2:10:53| So thank you all for being involved and thank you all for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| I don't know who is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| Mr. King, if you and Mr. Lowell could kind of quickly tell me the three things I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7861)|
| 2:11:10| the problems, noise, congestion and traffic, and two kinds of traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| One is internal and one is on the external.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| And I'd just like to know how that is adversely going to affect not only the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| but, you know, if it's a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| I mean, how is that going to be a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| Well, in fairness to you, sir, in response to your question, the fact that it increases traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7893)|
| 2:11:41| it doesn't at least currently increase traffic into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| or through any of the particular surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| with the exception of the fact that it further generates further traffic on Kingston Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| which everybody knows is a pretty busy street to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| I think our biggest point or maybe I'll not say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| One of the points about the increase in density is that putting an additional two buildings on that part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7926)|
| 2:12:18| which is in essence surrounded on the east, west and south side by residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| results in all of those surrounding residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| If you look at how it's going to have to lay out to get those additional buildings in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7949)|
| 2:12:34| to deal with that additional density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| it's going to be looking like looking at those buildings as if they were almost themselves a wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7957)|
| 2:12:44| because of the intensity of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| So in that sense, I say, yes, it is an impact to the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| not so much by its putting traffic into their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| but it is having an impact on them in that it does add more traffic to Kingston Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7978)|
| 2:13:05| and it has that, if you will, visual and noise impact to the adjoining properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7985)|
| 2:13:13| just because of the sheer existence of additional buildings to put those additional units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| and those additional people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| Right now, at eight units to the acre, they can put 312 dwelling units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8000)|
| 2:13:31| What they want is 351.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8011)|
| 2:13:36| We just say, you know, our idea was about 300 units ought to be the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| That's where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| They got 312.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Now they want more at 351.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| That does the reason for our respect, in all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| our insistence that the eight dwelling units were sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| I guess if he has anything pertinent, you know, quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| Thank you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| Line of sight and noise issues are the main concerns of the boundary homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| And interesting in this process, I've changed my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| thanks to one of our engineers that helped work with the developers for Kingston Overlook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8053)|
| 2:14:20| the first entry of commercial development south of Kingston Pike, west of Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8060)|
| 2:14:28| A combination of natural buffering consisting of trees and bushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8068)|
| 2:14:38| with a combination of berming and privacy fence is the best solution for each individual homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8078)|
| 2:14:46| and it changes on the slope of the land and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| But, however, berming is required up to six feet to make an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| Four feet berming does not help on noise in the commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| And so I don't know if anybody's looked at Kingston Overlook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| but they've got much higher berming and they have a privacy fence on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| So that will help mitigate some of the line of sight issues, but not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| But, you know, we're willing to go with some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| I guess I have a concern and maybe a question for Ms. Pelow about the amendment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| When I first saw this, my thought was, oh, you know, there's a compromise, it's been worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| And I'm hearing from, fairly vociferously from a few people in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| that this actually isn't a compromise between the two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| Well, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| And I hear from you sort of saying, well, there wasn't direct discussion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| it was the spirit of what both sides were talking about, sort of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| and you feel good about this as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| Well, actually, I do from this standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| And I think we all can feel good about increasing the space between the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8152)|
| 2:16:00| and the residential by 25 extra feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| I think it's going to make an enormous difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| And, frankly, when the residents came to the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| their main concern and their request was that 25 feet be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| The developers absolutely agreed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| even at the cost of having to reengineer and redraft their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| And I think they've spent two days, and that means dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| making those alterations to their plan in order to accommodate the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| and the concerns of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| So, to that extent, the compromise was taken very seriously by the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8203)|
| 2:16:51| Unfortunately, it has cost them a great deal in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| and I think it was considered that maybe this would be a manner in which there could be some accommodation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8218)|
| 2:17:06| given by both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| And then I think everyone learned that that was not something that wanted to be accepted by the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8228)|
| 2:17:16| But the developers did not pull back their willingness to offer the extra 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8236)|
| 2:17:23| So it was an effort toward compromise, which, unfortunately, was not joined in by both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8243)|
| 2:17:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| Councilman Horquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| I have not had a chance to meet with the developers yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| and I hope to do that between first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| I've heard reference to the sector plan calling for town center type development on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8268)|
| 2:17:56| and that appears to be not where we're at now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| but I don't feel like I have enough information to know exactly what this development is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| I know that it's going to be a segmented development, commercial, office, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| And I am concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| I certainly look forward to meeting with the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| which they've asked me to do, between first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| But I would like to explore if there is a way of getting us closer to healthy development layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8303)|
| 2:18:34| in the development that does end up happening on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8314)|
| 2:18:40| And I think perhaps that's something that I will personally have to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| with the developer between first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| But I just wanted to go ahead and say that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| I think we've got plenty of poorly designed developments that are segmented, that are not walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| that force people to literally get in their car or encourage them to get in their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| to drive from one end of the development to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| And I think there's plenty of evidence now that developments that take a slightly different approach are very effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8343)|
| 2:19:12| they're very profitable, and they're very attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| not only to people that might frequent them or choose to live in the residential portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| but to businesses that want to locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| So I'm looking forward to that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Just briefly, I think I'm actually, Ms. Pilo, going to vote no on your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| And I think part of what you said is this was a compromise offer by one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| and I feel like they were honest, but it wasn't accepted by the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| And I think that means we've still got work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| And I definitely think this is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| It doesn't quite feel like we've worked this out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| So maybe one more step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| Well, I'll just say I don't believe it could be worked out because when we worked out one angle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8392)|
| 2:19:58| there just seemed to be a new angle just waiting around the corner to pop its head in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| So we're now voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8411)|
| 2:20:12| Restate the amendment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| Restate the amendment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Are you serious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| I've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Lost me there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| With the exception of limiting the height to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8424)|
| 2:20:28| I've got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| I was still on the amended amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| All those in favor of amending the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8439)|

| 2:20:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Was there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| Now we're going to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| Is there any further discussion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| Now we're voting on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8460)|

| 2:21:20| Mr. Huckless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| I just wanted to say that I've met with Mr. Wallen and his developer, and they are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| excited about the Cumberland Avenue plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| Looking to see if they're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| There they are, back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| As it's materialized so far with the guidelines that have been put forth, interim guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| that are now attached to C-7, as I referenced earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| So I think they're going to move forward on producing a high-quality mixed-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8506)|
| 2:21:53| that will be very fitting for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070911?start=8513)|
