| 0:12:46| All right, we've got a motion to approve the consent list with the exception of 8, item 8 and item 21 by Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=774)|

| 0:12:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| We will begin with agenda item number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Applicant is Randy Gennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=791)|

| 0:13:19| Approximate size of track, 5.38 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Present plan and zoning designation is office, stream protection, RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Proposed plan designation, MDRO, medium density residential office, stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| Existing land use, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Motion one would be approve the medium density residential land use classification because it provides a transition of land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| intensities and is supported by local residential amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Stream protection area would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Bear with me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=846)|
| 0:14:19| I must have overlooked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Do you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| Am I missing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| Bear with me just a moment please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=877)|
| 0:14:47| Okay, where's the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=894)|
| 0:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=918)|
| 0:15:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| So one is a sector, one is a one-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| All right, we've satisfied my confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| It will be the same motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| One will be for a sector plan and one will be for the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=949)|
| 0:15:58| All right, and I see the applicant is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| If you'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Randy Gennard, 5408 Fountain Gate, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=964)|
| 0:16:13| I find it very privileged to be able to speak first in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| I've never been able to do that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Anyway, what we're looking at is a townhouse development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Mr. Gennard, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I guess I should have asked if there was any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| so that you would have that choice to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| I was going to go first anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| All right, you're going to go first regardless, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| We're looking at a townhouse development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Incorporating a historic house on this property is built in 1887 called the Maples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| and I think the staff's done a good job looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| We've had Lindsey Crockett out there on the property and looked at what we can do and we can't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| and so we've been also in contact with Kevin Murphy, and he's been in contact with Alice Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| I think there's a letter on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| I've met with the planning staff to see what we could do on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| and we needed some more density on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| The challenge on this piece is what to do with this historic house to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| We've looked at it as a shared workspace, possibly a community center, a clubhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| but more likely a shared workspace as these townhouses will be more for the affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| and so shared workspace is going away a little bit, but that's what we'd like to do currently with this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1058)|
| 0:17:47| The staff recommended MDR by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| We'd like to maintain the MDR-O designation on this so we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| Initially, when we met with staff, we put it down as an MDR-O so that we could do an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1078)|
| 0:18:09| We like to work with staff and stay consistent with what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| so I'm a little different now that I'm asking to reconsider as an O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| In this case, we feel it is justified for us for the O and not just MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| so we can develop and maintain the existing historic house on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| We're thinking shared workspace on that, so for an office scenario where the community could use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| but it's going to be a walkable neighborhood, pocket neighborhood involving townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1119)|
| 0:18:47| I'd just like to ask you to approve as an MDR-O on the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| We will have to come back as a special use on this for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Thank you, Mr. Goddard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| Commission, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| Yeah, Mr. Chair, I guess I'd like to have staff speak to the applicant's request for the O as submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1160)|
| 0:19:30| and why that didn't get carried through on the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| Ms. Hillman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| There's no zoning change proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| It's just a land use classification amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| RN-4 is the current zoning, which does not permit an office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| What the MDR classification would permit is special use review of more intensive townhome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| or multi-unit development within the RN-4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| We determined that because of the historic integrity of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| and the stream protection considerations on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| that MDR, the less intensive classification, was more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| because it doesn't permit consideration of zoning like RN-5, RN-6, and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1210)|
| 0:20:23| So obviously there's a little more density that would come with keeping the office classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1223)|
| 0:20:32| but then your request of doing a use in that house, is that why you would need the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| or is it more the density or is it a little bit of both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| No, it's mainly the house, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| We can get the density without the O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Okay. That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Yeah, as I look at it, I mean, currently in the plan right now, it's already office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| The sector plan already calls for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I think office could be a good use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| I mean, it borders the Walmart over there, a good transitional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| We always view office as a good transition between heavy commercial and any type of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| That being said, I understand where staff's coming from with trying to protect what's going on on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| but we've got the applicant on record stating that he wants to keep the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| the historical structure on there, and then possibly renovate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| In my opinion, I don't see why we can't go with the MDR O to give the applicant the opportunity to do both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1297)|
| 0:21:47| to save the house, use it as an office, and still have the residential component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| Now, that being said, as Ms. Hillman pointed out, this is not a zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| It's purely the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| So any kind of zoning request that he would want to change past the R and 4 would have to come back in front of this body and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| So I think that's where some of the protection would be with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| So I just want to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Commissioner, and just before I get to Commissioner Adams, I want to clarify because I was confused on the front end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| This will require two motions, a sector plan and a one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| So we'll do two motions on this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| So, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| I think I'm seeking a little clarification because I thought what Jesse said was that by going with the MD, as it is now, not the MDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1358)|
| 0:22:49| that there would be we would have the chance for additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| It would not, by right, have R and 5 and R and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| So with the current zoning of R and 4, townhomes or multi-unit development over a certain unit threshold goes through special use review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| where one of the criteria is looking at the land use classification and whether that supports what's being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| With either MDRO or MDR, both would support consideration of those types of townhouse or multi-unit developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| The distinction between the two is that MDRO permits future rezonings that are more intensive, whereas MDR, the most intensive district is R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1405)|
| 0:23:37| Okay, so the MDR works in terms of what the applicant wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| except for the one historic structure because of the desire to do an office space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| So there's not an opportunity to do just a special use for that one structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| Not with the current zoning district. R and 4 doesn't allow office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1438)|
| 0:24:10| One reason I brought that up now is that we can get a rezoning in almost a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| but when your plan takes three months, it's every quarter on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| This is for Jesse. Just a clarification. I think it was kind of like Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| So there is not a possibility to rezone it to MDR with an exception of the historic house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1471)|
| 0:24:42| since the historic house is already zoned office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| So the current zoning is R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Okay. This is one of those unusual cases where the sector plan doesn't align with the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| So in the one year plan, the land use classification is office. In the sector plan, it's low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| We're recommending that that classification be medium density residential, which would allow him to pursue townhouse development as described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1503)|
| 0:25:12| Within his current zoning, though, an office use would not be permitted. He's not requesting a rezoning at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| With MDRO, as he's saying, it would allow him to request an additional rezoning, perhaps a partial rezoning for office to pursue that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1520)|
| 0:25:32| I will say that R and 4 does permit like a community or a cultural center, as he also described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| Commissioner Schell, so maybe Ms. Hillman, what would the neighborhood non-residential reuse special use request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1541)|
| 0:25:57| would an office use be able to fall under that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| My understanding is it would have had to have been at one time used in that way or intended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1563)|
| 0:26:12| Let me verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you. So a neighborhood non-residential use is subject to special use approval within a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1575)|
| 0:26:37| If it is non-residential in its original construction and or use. So this was originally a residential structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| I think I kind of took that to mean the actual neighborhood in which the property was non-residential, not so much the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1605)|
| 0:27:07| With the grist mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Yeah, I mean, just being like, you know, a farm essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| All right. Well, that's that was my question. If that could be something that could accommodate it within our R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you. It just seems like we're trying to figure out how could this be classified and work without changing the MDR to MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1646)|
| 0:27:38| And Ms. Hillman did indicate that the community center, cultural center would work inside the current zoning and land classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1658)|
| 0:27:50| Within R and 4, a community center and a cultural center can be considered and cultural facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1670)|
| 0:27:59| Right. I'm going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| To me, this sounds like the type of activity that the applicant is wanting to provide to this new community would be similar to if you're familiar with Fourth and Gill and the birdhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1685)|
| 0:28:19| That, you know, it's it's a community asset. You could certainly go and work there if you wanted to, but you could have an art show and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| So it seems like the community center route would take care of what the applicant is going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| And I'll say, I don't know that we have enough detail yet on exactly what Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| Mr. Gennard wants to do, and we would want to involve the city's plans review and inspection department because they would ultimately be the ones to make the decision of whether or not that would fall under this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1723)|
| 0:28:59| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| So the differences between MDR and MDRO is the MDR allows for higher density residential and it allows for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1742)|
| 0:29:12| None of the residential districts allow for office use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| So the only reason that an MDRO would be beneficial for this is if they wanted to later rezone to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1759)|
| 0:29:30| Office has limitations of only six apartment units and the density for townhouses is the same as are in for is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| So there is a possibility that may be, you know, a future goal. I think I would be more comfortable voting for that if that if that was the intention later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1779)|
| 0:29:50| Had that been included in this request to go with office because otherwise switching to MDRO also opens up the possibility of RN six and RN seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1790)|
| 0:30:01| And since this is a historic site and we're discussing trying to, I guess, maintain the intensity that happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| Without further context, I don't see a good reason to go with MDRO as opposed to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1810)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you, Chairman Hill. This might be more of a question to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| And I apologize if you've already addressed this, but I know the preservation of these historic houses is incredibly challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| And developers, in my opinion, need as much flexibility as they can possibly have for an adaptive reuse, which is what the community really wants around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1836)|
| 0:30:48| Can you tell me again, what does MDRO give you to be able to do to this house that you would not be able to with the MDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1848)|
| 0:30:57| And in the main, it allows us to do an office if we come back and get a rezoning to office for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1857)|
| 0:31:05| And that's just what we're looking at a rezoning for office. I could almost get it in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| But one year plan is four times a year. So it's just a length of when you fall in there, you could be three months away from trying to get some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1870)|
| 0:31:20| So you could see your adaptive reuse for the historic home being like a central office for the community around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| Yes, where you could bring in sales people or you could hold sales events or, you know, like like the shared workspace was where you might have eight different offices in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1888)|
| 0:31:40| For the people in that community where maybe they travel some and one day a week they're in an office, whatever whatever it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| A community center is is fairly easy. We could do one of those anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| So we were looking at this house. What are we going to do with this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| It doesn't have a lot of open area for like a community center. We looked at putting something like an eatery, like a pizza place in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| Then I got to go to commercial. So how do you use this to as a vital part of the community that you're wanting to get affordable housing into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1924)|
| 0:32:17| It's going to be townhomes, smaller townhomes. And that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| It could be something as simple as just a regional sales office for somebody that's working for, you know, somebody in Chicago or Minneapolis or Detroit or somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1942)|
| 0:32:36| I mean, if it gives our applicant the ability to preserve this house from a historic standpoint, I'm up for giving him all the flexibility he could possibly have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1956)|
| 0:32:46| So I could certainly support NDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I don't actually think that the land, I could be wrong, will support our in five or six the way it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| So that that wasn't our intention. But anyway, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| Yeah. And listening to Mr. Gannard, I mean, I think it's a good opportunity to for an adaptive reuse situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| Yeah. As Commissioner Browning had mentioned, I mean, it's hard. What do you do with these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| You don't want to tear them down. You want to preserve them. But how do you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| You know, what what use do they have today that they, you know, is different than 100 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2001)|
| 0:33:28| I, again, don't see. I mean, with the Wal-Mart being in that location and literally just, you know, less than 100 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2008)|
| 0:33:36| Is this this structure and this this property that coupled with the fact that any other zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2016)|
| 0:33:46| if you did want to try to go into a higher density or situation such as that would have to come back again in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| And then if it if this body and or the city council did not feel that was the right right thing, it would be discussed at that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2033)|
| 0:34:03| But at MDRO, it gives the applicant the flexibility to move forward and provide some good affordable housing as well as preserve a, you know, an old structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2043)|
| 0:34:14| That being said, I'd like to make a motion to approve the MDRO land classification because it provides a transition of land use intensities and is supported by local residential amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2054)|
| 0:34:28| The SV stream protection would be retained. Second. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| We have a motion to approve MDRO by Commissioner Huber, seconded by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| We still have some discussion left on this matter. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| I was going to echo what Commissioner Huber said about I think I get comfort knowing that any rezoning to our five or six would come back in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2088)|
| 0:34:57| And then additionally, without knowing whether the community center use would allow for the shared office plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| I'm hesitant to slow up the development without that kind of knowledge. And so I think I'll be voting in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you. Commissioner Higgins. I just want to say I'm not necessarily against MDR being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| If that is what is needed for the use, I guess I've got a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| If if you know that office isn't allowed under the current zoning and that you would have to rezone to office in order to be able to have an office here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2127)|
| 0:35:37| Why not include that in this request? Since you said townhouses office allows the same density as are in for with townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2137)|
| 0:35:46| Why wasn't that included in this request? It was probably a mistake on my part because I looked at the are in for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2146)|
| 0:35:55| And at the end, it says other applicable uses for something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| And I thought the office was in there. I found out later that it wasn't. So that's my fault. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| Thanks. Right. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| Yeah, I'm certainly not against the townhomes, the adaptive reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| I don't think that going with MDR as it is would slow up the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| So I don't I don't feel like this is a necessary component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| It opens up what happens to this property if this applicant wasn't the person developing it just down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| So I'm not going to support this motion, but I want to just state the record that it's it's not because I'm not for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| I think townhomes there would be good. And I appreciate the adaptive reuse. Thank you. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2204)|
| 0:36:53| All right. Commissioner Huber, just let everyone know we're voting on the sector plan and then we're going to come back and potentially vote on the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2213)|
| 0:37:04| All right. So we have a motion and a second to approve MDRO on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| We've got one opposed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2235)|
| 0:37:25| I'd like to make a motion that motion passes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| With respect to the one year plan, I'd like to make a motion to approve the MDRO land use classification because it provides transition of land use intensities and is supported by local residential amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2249)|
| 0:37:41| The SP stream protection area would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| All right. We have a motion from Commissioner Huber, seconded by Commissioner Barger on the one year plan as MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2266)|
| 0:37:57| With the stream protection being retained. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| We have one opposed. Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2285)|
| 0:38:19| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Do I have a slip sheet for that one? 13-1. Both motions pass 13-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2304)|
| 0:38:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| On to agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Applicant is Benjamin C. Mullins. Location north and south side of Pratt Road, east of Tower Drive, west of Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| Approximate size of track 5.58 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Present land and zoning designation. Low density residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| R in one proposed plan designation MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| Existing land use is single family residential commercial multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| Staff recommendation is to approve MDRO land use classification because it is consistent with the land use classification intent as a transition between commercial uses and a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2358)|
| 0:39:40| Motion two is to approve MDRO land use classification on the one year regarding the one year plan because it is consistent with the land use classifications intent as a transition between commercial uses and a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2380)|
| 0:39:57| Motion three regarding rezoning is approve the RN5 district because it meets the intent of the zoning district as a buffer between single family residential neighborhoods and commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2397)|
| 0:40:11| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I am. Good afternoon. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| Timothy Allen and my address is 121 Caron Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| Mr. Mullins, do you want to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| I'll defer, please. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Okay. Mr. Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2432)|
| 0:40:41| My name is Timothy Allen. I live at 121 Caron Road. I've been there for 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| It's a small community and my neighbors have agreed and asked that I come and speak for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2447)|
| 0:40:55| We're a very small homeowner community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| One of the reasons I decided to purchase in the neighborhood is because it was very quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| This information about this hearing, we just received it, well, I just received it in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| So some of my neighbors, we had talked about it and we asked that we could postpone the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| But the reason that we want to postpone it is to get more information about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| One of the key points of our issue is infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| Our community has had infrastructure problems for a number of years, and we feel like it can only get worse with more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2497)|
| 0:41:49| We're not opposed to growth, but we want to make sure it's done in a way that's responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2509)|
| 0:41:57| Traffic is an issue, as well as density and change of neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| We would like to keep the neighborhood similar to what it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| And if there is an approval, we would like for it to be single family versus multi-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you, Mr. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Like I said, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| This was pulled off consent, so I'm trying to get my notes in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| I know I represent the owners, Ed Smith, Merchant Town Center LLC and Partners LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2549)|
| 0:42:38| They own the conglomerate of properties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| They're also the O zoning property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| That is a Hilton hotel that he owns as well, and he's owned that for quite some time and has developed other properties in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| We were looking at wanting to develop some small-scale multifamily on this property, and we met with planning staff and talked about what the options were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2571)|
| 0:43:04| especially in this location where you have a very large commercial node, some higher-intensity uses, a very large grocery store there, some hotels, some self-storage, just a very diverse selection of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2584)|
| 0:43:14| And then the office there as well is also a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| But then what would be an appropriate use for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| But then what would be an appropriate use between that area, which has been growing and within a quarter of a mile of a public transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| and this older established single-family residential neighborhood there to the north, where Mr. Allen lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| And that's where we talked about, you know, what would be an appropriate use for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| And that's where we talked about the MDRO and the RN-5 would allow an opportunity for that transitional use as a step down between the more intense commercial uses and that single-family residential neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2617)|
| 0:43:45| And that's where we talked about the MDRO and the RN-5 would allow an opportunity for that transitional use as a step down between the more intense commercial uses and that single-family residential neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2625)|
| 0:44:02| I did have some conversations with the property owners that abut the northern boundary of the proposed rezoning, and they had some concerns about screening and landscaping and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2642)|
| 0:44:12| They didn't express any concerns about the zoning and the multifamily being at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| They would definitely prefer that than, you know, another commercial development creeping towards their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| But they did, there's some old trees, some old-growth trees there that grow along the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| and they had some concerns about whether those trees would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| And, of course, that's, you know, within the 10-foot, in the RN-5, there's a 10-foot landscaping peripheral there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| And, you know, those trees would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| There wouldn't be any issue with being able to keep those trees and developing the rest of the property under the RN-5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| That was the only feedback I'd heard before today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| I do know it's an older neighborhood, and I'm sure that it was developed under different infrastructure standards, different stormwater standards and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2694)|
| 0:45:04| You know, there would be an opportunity, you know, once this moves forward through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| the Plans Review and Inspections Department with the City of Knoxville as to what improvements to the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| and what improvements may be needed to Pratt Road to develop this as multifamily in the RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| But we do think it's an appropriate use, as does staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| I have no issue with meeting with Mr. Allen and the neighbors and having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| This is going to have to go through City Council as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| and we would be happy to set up a meeting with the District Commissioner there, Charlie Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| and the neighborhood to talk about their issues before City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| They have the final say in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| But given staff's recommendation, we would ask that you approve it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| and allow us to take the time between now and the City Council meetings in February to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Seeing that there does need to be or seem to need to be some additional conversation with the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2765)|
| 0:46:14| I think this, personally, I think it looks like a good movement in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| but I am concerned that there are neighbors that haven't been able to ask questions and get confirmed answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| So I hear what Mr. Mullins is saying about Council having the final say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| but I wonder if it wouldn't benefit from a 30-day postponement at this body to give them adequate time to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| I'd be in favor of that if there's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| I wouldn't mind hearing from Mr. Adams or Mr. Allen to see what the nature of those uncertainties are or unknowns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| I apologize. I'm a little hearing impaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| My battery in my hearing aid went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| So if you'd ask the question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Commissioner Adams is contemplating a motion for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| I was just asking, I'd be interested in, I guess, the nature of the unknowns that you guys may be seeking over that 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2838)|
| 0:47:29| More so infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| We've had water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| I don't know who has control of the map, but above to the north of the neighborhood is steeplechase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| which is a big development and has put a lot of strain in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Commissioner Adams, I'm not sure as far as it relates to infrastructure what we would glean between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| No, I know infrastructure is beyond what we can really address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| But I do, I guess, want to encourage Mr. Mullins to do as he said he would do and speak to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2884)|
| 0:48:14| I think I always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| I have no problem being with the neighbors at all and be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| With all due respect to Mr. Allen, you know, Pratt Road is an interesting road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2906)|
| 0:48:34| You've got a Hampton Inn and you've got a true by Hilton right across the street from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2914)|
| 0:48:42| It does seem like some pretty intense commercial has already been moving down that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| and this does seem like a really logical transition kind of buffer between that true by Hilton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2930)|
| 0:49:03| and the single family residential developments down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| I do personally know the owner of the property, and I can tell you both those hotels consistently received the Lighthouse Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2949)|
| 0:49:22| which is truly the ultimate honor for a hotel, and there's a lot of pride of ownership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| So I think you can rest assured that you're going to get a quality development there between that hotel and that single family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2972)|
| 0:49:45| So just due to that, I think I could certainly support this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| Thank you, Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I'd like to make a motion to approve the MDRO land-use classification because it is consistent with the land-use classification's intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| as a transition between the commercial uses in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3005)|

| 0:55:35| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Would you like to proceed or defer to the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| I'll proceed really briefly and then reserve the rest of my time to address the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| I was just retained on this earlier this week and immediately reached out to Director Snowden and we have a meeting next Thursday to talk about what would be expected as far as sidewalks and improvements along Sam Lee Road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3348)|
| 0:56:04| I know there's a pretty significant curve in Sam Lee right at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| And I know my clients have already done a good job reaching out to the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates and discussing some of their concerns and about how that can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3369)|
| 0:56:19| We have no objection to staff's recommendation for five units an acre that they've recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| It's a little unique. This property is in the medium density residential sector plan and the low density recommendation sector plan range of five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3384)|
| 0:56:36| But we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| And actually, once we can get more information and work with the county as to what improvements would be expected, we actually think we will come in below five units an acre and have committed to Hardin Valley Planning Advocates and that organization that we will work with them and tell them exactly what we're asking for before we get to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3397)|
| 0:56:59| But until we really have more information, we want to go ahead and ask for staff's recommendation, give us a chance to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3419)|
| 0:57:06| And, you know, again, once county commission has the final say, you know, once we've talked to the neighbors and talked to Mr. Snowden, we expect that our request for the density will be even less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3426)|
| 0:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| And the opposition is free to come to the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| Is it Mr. Pink or Leppink?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| How do you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Leppink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| Yeah, I'm Jim Leppink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| One one three oh one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Sam Lee Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Three seven nine three two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| I'm opposed to this rezoning property of five units because basically I'm afraid you're setting a dangerous precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3463)|
| 0:57:53| By rezoning this property to this high of a density, you only encourage the other property owners to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3473)|
| 0:58:02| Anyone with a few acres would be motivated to rezone their property and you would have no basis to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| In a few years, Sam Lee Road would be nearly impossible because of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3491)|
| 0:58:24| I know you guys have been doing this long enough to see what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| And this is not it's not going to be pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| I've been told there's no plans for funding in the near future to address the traffic flow problems that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3512)|
| 0:58:42| This type of development will make it more difficult and more expensive to address those problems in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3522)|
| 0:58:55| I mean, I don't know if any of you have had to ever had to deal with facing down a semi truck hauling a bulldozer coming around the curve in the middle of a narrow two lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3535)|
| 0:59:08| But I can tell you, it's it's a near death experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| Sam Lee, Sam Lee Road was not designed to handle this type of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| Right now, when the school's let out, there are cars lined up on Hardin Valley Road, a steel road waiting to pick up students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3560)|
| 0:59:32| They're lined up on the sides of the roads, in the turn lanes and on the roads themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| The only alternative to get around it is to use Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| It's becoming a challenge for me to pull out of my driveway every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| I understand that the builders motivation is to maximize profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Mine is preserved. Mine is to preserve the Hardin Valley community and our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3598)|
| 1:00:07| In the end, the builder moves on and the residents are left to deal with the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| There's already an overdevelopment problem in Hardin Valley. There's no need to make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| You guys know what's going to happen if you allow this type of density in a rural area like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3624)|
| 1:00:32| I know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| I think we should just not allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Do we have other? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| Hi, I'm Dawn Walsh speaking on behalf of Hardin Valley Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| I just wanted to reiterate that we have been speaking with Red Door and we have asked for reduced density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| We're grateful that they're not requesting more based on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| They've been really conversational about what they're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| and I feel like they really understand what we're looking for in terms of reduced density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3674)|
| 1:01:21| and also making it a community that has space that can feel like a community with sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| with usable green space, not just a retention pond or a retention area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| but a place where children can play since we have such a lack of parks in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| And in the area. And then we also spoke a little bit about roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| They have a meeting set up with engineering, I think, next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| But it would be so amazing if there and I realize that's a whole road project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| But if that could connect sidewalks to steel road because that sidewalk does connect all the way to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3711)|
| 1:01:58| And this is the parental responsibility zone that would really help cut down on traffic from that subdivision trying to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3718)|
| 1:02:07| Because I don't know if you've been on steel at drop off time, but that completely backs all the way up almost to the stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3727)|
| 1:02:17| So. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| Mr. Chair, seeing that the applicant has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| Talk to the community who's very active out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| And although they're not saying this is final with the density that's being proposed today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| less than what was approved and what staff is recommending, it sounds like they're heading in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| So I will make a motion that we approve PR plan residential zone up to five for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Second. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| All right. We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Higgins to approve PR up to five dwelling units per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3771)|
| 1:03:03| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3783)|
| 1:03:16| Next is agenda item 19. Applicant is Leonard Development LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| Location. West side of Catlett Road. South side of Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Ten point nine acres. Present zoning is agricultural. Zoning requested. Planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry and vacant land. Density proposed up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3814)|
| 1:03:44| Staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone with up to five dwelling units per acre because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3824)|
| 1:03:55| Is the applicant present? Present. Do we have any opposition? Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3835)|
| 1:04:05| Seeing no. We do. OK. Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3845)|
| 1:04:18| We'll call it opposition. Would you like to proceed or defer? I'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| Here on behalf of the applicant, as noted by the chairman, the instant rezoning request is from agricultural to planned residential at a density of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3870)|
| 1:04:42| This request is consistent with the low density residential sector plan designation under the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| This area has been changing over the past 20 plus years from agricultural zoning to planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3890)|
| 1:05:00| There are several planned residential zoning properties in the in the in the area with densities anywhere from three dwelling units per acre all the way up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3900)|
| 1:05:12| As noted in the staff report, there's adequate road infrastructure, specifically this property served by Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| Snyder Road, within the past 10 years, has been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| It connects to Outlet Drive, which presumably will be the primary way traffic will flow from Snyder Road to Outlet Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3925)|
| 1:05:35| Outlet Drive connects to North North Campbell Station Road and Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| And those are two major connections because they connect into two major interstate interchanges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| This allows the traffic to be disbursed versus concentrated in a general area, therefore diminishing traffic concerns, traffic blockages, delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3950)|
| 1:06:02| The answer request is consistent with the general plan and the development policies under the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| The northwest county sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| We ask that you follow staff recommendation for the reason for rezoning the property to plan residential density of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3971)|
| 1:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| Would you like to speak or have a question or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3983)|
| 1:06:33| My name is Cindy Faith and I live at 1117 Carolwood Road and in the area that he's speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=3993)|
| 1:06:41| And I know there's comments that I saw online. I've never been to a assembly like this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| So forgive me for not signing up, but we have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| And I know he probably has the comments, but if they can address those concerns, we don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| But I do have a problem with the emptying out on the Catlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| If there's going to be a big housing area there, they can't empty out on that small of a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| It's very small, skinny, winding road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| And it's going to be a big problem as far as the roads and then also possibly for my home for the storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4033)|
| 1:07:26| I'd like to know a little bit more about that, how it's going to be directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| Any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| Dawn Walsh, Hardin Valley Planning Advocates again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Finally was able to speak with the applicant on this one this morning briefly and express the same concerns that we have with basically everything in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4063)|
| 1:07:53| which is just the the strain on school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| This one does have elementary that goes to Farragut, but middle and high school do go to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4077)|
| 1:08:04| And so just explain to him that we're also requesting reduced density on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| He did express that they don't have a concept plan in the works yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| And so they're not sure where any of the red stuff is going to align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| But we have reached out and we are talking to them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Would Engineering like to comment? Mr. Elliott, would you like to comment on that or on the Catlett Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| Yes, I think our preference would be that they access Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| If they were to access Catlett, we would be asking for roadway improvements as it is narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4116)|
| 1:08:44| All right. Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4124)|
| 1:08:52| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| I just had a question about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| I forget which planner is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| Ms. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Ms. Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| She's out, but I'll be happy to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| If you can remind me how planning got to recommending the five, because when I look at the map, I see approvals for one to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4148)|
| 1:09:23| So I'm questioning the density there, and I'm wondering if it's because of the hillside component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| So it does have a little bit of hillside protection on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| They are pretty modest for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| I think this property is a little bit over 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| There's three acres within the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| About half of that is 15 to 25, and about the other, or I'm sorry, zero to 15, and the other half is 15 to 25 percent, which is pretty modest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4185)|
| 1:09:58| So, I mean, for the most part, it's a pretty good site for density, being that it's located on classified streets and has pretty good access around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4198)|
| 1:10:12| We felt that the $5 billion per acre was acceptable in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| So it wasn't – there wasn't a look at the properties around it and what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| Well, if you look – I mean, just in general, there's some intense development in the general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4225)|

| 1:20:27| How much time is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| How about two minutes each if all three are going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| We had planned on five minutes each. I can make mine shorter than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Yeah. Let's go with two each or you can designate a spokesman to take all the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4839)|
| 1:20:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| We haven't started the clock yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Could we have 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| We have rules with this body and you asked 15 and somebody else asked 30 and where does it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4866)|
| 1:21:14| Could it be shorter than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| I gave you six. The rules are five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| So let's see what six will get us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| Switch up. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| That was unexpected. So if you could just give me a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| All right. Got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Just just just to be clear. So, you know, we won't be sure villainous up here or appear to be villainous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| Can my shot clock go to five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Yeah, we'll start the clock to the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| If we're going to have three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| But these rules have been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Yeah. You want to have 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| She wants 30 seconds of the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Laura is going to share hers to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| We'll divide it out however you all want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| But let's be respectful of the others, because if you go over, we won't have time for the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| But these are to say they're unexpected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| These rules have been in place for a very, very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Who's going to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Rosemarie Abrams, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| OK. Thank you, Miss Abrams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| And where is the clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Or is there one right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| OK. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| OK. So is this cup full or empty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| OK. You are charged with being creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| You are charged with having solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| You're charged with having a perspective, a long range perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| If I put rocks in this cup all the way up to here, is the cup full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| If I add sand, is the cup full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| If I add water, is the cup full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| Is the cup full like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Talk to the wind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| Talk to a person who puts it over their mouth and nose to keep the smoke out if they're going through a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| It can be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| You can be creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| It can be empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| What we need is your creative perspective on the fact that we already have not considered infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=4994)|
| 1:23:22| We already have not considered more schooling, availability of natural infrastructure to help us out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| In the last two weeks, we've had two incidents that tied up traffic forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| One was a tree down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| One was an actual collision on North Shore, right next to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| Even the emergency vehicles could not get there to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| They had to heliport people out to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| We have many, many young drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| The roads are not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| We need infrastructure development before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| Imagine taking this cup, putting in the water, then the sand, then the rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| We got a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Please be creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| Please be helpful to our community, and please do not rezone this for more until we have better infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5049)|
| 1:24:17| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Did we start with five or six minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5062)|
| 1:24:31| You may begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| I now have one minute and 43 seconds less than I planned, so I'm going to speak fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Well, I'm going to add another minute to the 317, so you got 417.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| Praise the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| The first round of applause today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| I'm going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5090)|

| 1:24:56| This is my first time being here, so I very respectfully greet each of you and understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| that each and every one of you have a very important role in the development and expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| We have some very pressing issues out west, so while I do serve as president of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| of directors for Jefferson Park, we have 260 homes in there, I am here today as a concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| citizen, husband, and father of two young children that navigate a very deadly stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| of road with over 20,000 daily car passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| We have one way in and one way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| If you guys come there, I'm telling you it's dangerous just getting out of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| I'm saying a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| I will later articulate an alternate option, but primarily we are here to respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| request a moratorium on development in this stretch of North Shore, Harvey, and Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| until the Knox County Commission and Planning Commission not just budget, but rather both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| bodies approve, adopt, and implement necessary funds to bring much-needed, per Larsen J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| incremental capacity to North Shore, Choteau, and Harvey over a three-year period as recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| by Larsen J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Starting with North Shore, which has over 20,000 daily car passes, and per the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Department of Transportation, a 38% increase in car accidents in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| There were so many that the Knox County Sheriff's Department had to modify the way that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| tally car accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| They now require injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| In other words, 2023 data will appear suppressed versus this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| That covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Core issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| One, this development, as currently proposed, is detrimental to the character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| It is not consistent as currently proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| And then two, people are being killed on these roads every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| Killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Public safety is nonexistent, and emergency services are unable to access these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| Power lines go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Trees cross the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Miles and miles and miles of people backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| People can't get to their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Businesses can't run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Folks can't get to the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| It's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| Larsen J, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| Of course, it says where it can be shown that approval would have an adverse impact on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| character of the neighborhood in which the site is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| Y'all can vote this thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I'm not saying vote no forever, but just as it's currently proposed, we're asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| that you consider that, and then later we'll propose an alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| And I'm watching the clock here, so I've got to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| Stay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| So Larsen J, very graciously, on September 1st of 2023, he sent this letter to Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5244)|
| 1:27:33| Jacobs, and it cites a 38% increase, excuse me, 39% increase in car accidents on the North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5253)|
| 1:27:41| Shore Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Daylight hours represented 64%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| In clear weather conditions, 71%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| And along the roadway, not near an intersection, 83%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| He further says drivers are traveling at a high rate of speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| With a combination of a narrow roadway, it inevitably leads to an increase in accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| He then, on the next page, asks Mayor Jacobs to address these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5278)|

| 1:28:24| Okay, these folks have looked at this for Larsen J, so that he could quantify his recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| to Mayor Jacobs, and he says it's an estimate of two to four million of capital in today's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| dollars, and it would take one to three years to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5313)|

| 1:30:15| I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| My name is Laura Purcell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| I live at 1806 Blue Crane Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| I actually live in Falcon Point, which is directly across North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| It's south of North Shore from the development, and I'm not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| I know it's going to happen, and I appreciate your recommendation of three per acre without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| attached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I want to reiterate what Mike was saying about the predicament that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| We're in a situation that's a one way in, one way out on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| I don't know how much time you've spent out there, but when the tree fell, we have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| firefighters in our little fire station there where Choteau Markets is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| So, say my grandmother fell, and they're helping get her off the floor, and then my friend's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| house catches on fire, there's no way to get a fire truck to the fire because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| attending a first responders thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Even if the tree wasn't on the floor, I mean on the street, we have to get a fire truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| all the way from Campbell Station because the only other way in is a railroad trestle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| that's 10 foot 7 feet high, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| So, you'd have to have, how's an ambulance going to get to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| Where we're going to get another fire truck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| You get what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| We get your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| If you've ever been to Georgia, you know what I'm saying, to a football game, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| So, there was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| Oh, and those children at North Shore Elementary School, right now we have three kids per seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| in the bus and children sitting in the aisle, and they have had to make an amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| that to add an additional bus just to get children dropped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| So, now they're taking two buses down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| So, that's just a handful of the issues that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| So, I just appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Counselor, in an effort to give you equal time, if you need seven and a half minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| you'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I was only recently retained on this case, and I spent the better part of the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| reading the 565 comments in opposition, most of it in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| I understand being involved in other projects on South North Shore and the Choteau area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| that there's a lot of opposition to growth and development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| When we talk about long-range planning, we talk about what are the existing sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| and what does the growth policy plan call for in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Under the growth policy plan, this is planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| It will remain planned growth under the draft that was just recommended for approval by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| the growth policy plan committee last night as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| And the sector plan is designated for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| My client had asked for five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Staff had recommended three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| We are in agreement with staff's recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| If you do a one-mile radius, you look at the average density of the developments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| have been built out in that area, you're looking at about 3.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| So three dwelling units an acre is right in line with what has been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| And we know there are some improvements to South North Shore coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| This property has frontage on both South North Shore and Harvey Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| On South North Shore right now, it's 20 feet of pavement, but it's within a 70-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| And there's a lot of frontage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Once we get to a development plan phase, once we get to a traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| which will be required, and once we go through that process with Engineering Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| there will be recommendations as to what we need to do to address the impact that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| putting on the infrastructure because of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| That's what the standard is, is what are we causing and how can we mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| And that is another process down the line that will come back before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| through a development plan with a full traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| with recommended improvements that we would have to participate in as part of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| So, again, we are one step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| This is a piece of property that will be developed at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| and I think three units an acre with this community where this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| just west of the roundabout that was placed there at Choteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| which does serve as traffic calming for this stretch of south-north shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| I know south-north shore goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Jefferson Park is further down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| There's lots of issues along south-north shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| but this stretch right here is an area that's west of an already existing traffic calming device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| with that roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| We'll work with county engineering about what we need to do to improve Harvey Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5713)|
| 1:35:20| and south-north shore once we get that traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| once we know what we can do on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| But this meets the intent of the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| This meets the intent of the existing low-density residential sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| And knowing that we're going to have to come back and address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| with a full development plan in the planned residential zone, we would ask for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| Commissioner Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| I think this question is probably directed to Director Snowden or Mr. Elliott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| but first off, I mean, I lived in that area for nearly 10 years, and I do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| I don't currently live out there, but I did live out there for almost 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| and very familiar with the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| And they get a little challenging in areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| There has been a lot of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| But Director Snowden or Steve, can you guys speak to the accident percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| or the amount of accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| I mean, we heard some information from Mike Podesta about some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| Can you expand on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Be glad to, Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Jim Snowden, Engineering Director, Ross County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| In preparation for this, obviously, we saw all these comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| so we kind of pulled some of this information for the benefit of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| And we kind of broke North Shore down into two sections, really, from Harvey to Chouteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5807)|
| 1:36:56| and then from Chouteau to Concord because there are kind of two distinct areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| The traffic volumes are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| The crash rates are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| On the particular section here from Harvey to Chouteau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| the traffic volume is quite a bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| It's roughly 4,800 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| The crash rate there would give you an instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| The last three years, there's been 19 crashes on that stretch of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| That correlates to a crash rate that's less than statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| So the state has a calculation for, you know, the type of road, the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| because obviously the number of crashes is not really an indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| It's more of the rate that's applied to the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| So, you know, there's not really anything that we would consider to be a causative factor here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| in that particular area because the crash rate is lower than the statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| On the section to the east of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| obviously a much busier section carries between 12,000 and 17,000 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| as you go closer to the roundabout at Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| Obviously, a lot more crashes there, 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| That crash rate is a little elevated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| It's above the statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| In response to that and in some of the advanced NOx meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| we had a lot of conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| We are going to modernize that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| When I say modernize, we're not necessarily going to widen, you know, from two lanes to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| We are, as you all know out there, there's lack of shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| We want to improve those things because as traffic grows through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| we want to make sure those roadsides are very forgiving should someone get forced off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| And that process is being designed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Mayor Jacobs and Commissioner Schoonmaker were advocates for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| We anticipate starting construction on that if not late this year, next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| And we'll be adding shoulders and a little bit wider lanes in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| to obviously get that crash rate back down below that statewide average that we want to make sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| So hopefully that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| I'll be happy to provide any more insight, but that's kind of a brief synopsis of what we discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| I may be putting the cart in front of the horse here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| but would this development empty out on both South North Shore and Harvey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5945)|
| 1:39:18| Bueller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| I didn't know who the question was directed from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| We have access to both South North Shore and Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| We don't have a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| I anticipate that there will be access to Harvey and North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| but I don't know that until we actually sit down and do the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| But once we do that, there'll be a traffic impact analysis, what the flows are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| and then what improvements we may need to participate in on both of those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| Okay. I've driven on Harvey a lot, and it's real skinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Real skinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| And then for Director Snowden, the improvements that are going to be made on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| South North Shore, is that from Concord to Harvey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| or is that just the part between Concord and Choteau?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| Just from Concord to Choteau right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| because that's where we identified the crash problems based on the higher volumes there, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6002)|
| 1:40:13| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| I've got another question for engineering, if you don't mind, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Just looking at it, and I appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| because it certainly needs that widening from the Choteau roundabout all the way up to Concord Road up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6023)|
| 1:40:30| Gosh, I remember way back in the day, some of the folks here might remember it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| when there used to just be that flashing yellow light at Choteau Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6034)|
| 1:40:41| That was a serious, serious lot of fatalities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| But over time, infrastructure improvements have come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| They don't come as fast as we all like them to sometimes, but they do come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| So I'm glad to hear that there is some improvements happening from the Choteau roundabout up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| But specifically, with respect to the area between Harvey Road and Choteau Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| can you speak to a standard for what a Knox County road looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| What are the minimums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| What do you like to see on the width of the road and the striping and that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| Yeah. That section, I would imagine somewhere around 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| For a 20 feet wide road, we certainly want to see center and edge line striping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| Typically, you kind of look at volume versus width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| Rural road capacity is kind of a tricky thing to really get your head wrapped around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| But we feel like that width of road is reasonable to accommodate that 5,000 to 6,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6103)|
| 1:41:54| Now, obviously, as that traffic grows, we may have to approach this location much like we did to the one to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6114)|
| 1:42:00| and make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| But at this point in time, we feel like the traffic volume and the existing configuration of the road is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| And that's bore out through the crash rate that shows that it is below statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| Last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6134)|
| 1:42:25| Yeah, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| The Applicants Council mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| County Commission last night approved the advanced Knox, the first draft step of it, which talks about the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6155)|
| 1:42:43| I can't imagine how many hours, countless hours have been poured into that with consultants and such and public meetings about where that urban growth boundary would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6163)|
| 1:42:53| And and to try to protect the rural areas outside that that that boundary hasn't been finalized yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6173)|
| 1:43:02| But it was approved as a draft last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| You know, we've seen a lot of applicants today ask for, you know, uppers and four and five per the acre on Stanley Road, Maryville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6185)|
| 1:43:15| That's all inside that growth boundary, as staff suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| This is, you know, in the low density residential sector plan that would afford up to the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6199)|
| 1:43:28| You know, I'm I'm really, quite frankly, surprised that this developer is only asking for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| I'm not saying I would have voted for any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| But I think that Commissioner Schoonmaker, who is in that district and other folks, probably can breathe a little easier that this developer is asking for three instead of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6216)|
| 1:43:49| And I have a shot at working with the highway department and other folks on on traffic plans as you get traffic study requirements with with concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6229)|
| 1:44:01| So I think I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| We approve the plan residential zone at the third three per the acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Second. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| We've got a motion to approve plan residential zone up to three dwelling units per acre per staff recommendation by vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6252)|
| 1:44:21| Seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6267)|

| 1:45:06| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Approve agricultural zone because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| Floodway zone would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6316)|

| 1:45:38| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion we approve the agricultural zone because it's consistent with the sector plan surrounding development and the floodway zone would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6347)|

| 1:46:29| Zoning requested is CA general business and floodway, existing land use, agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6389)|
| 1:46:39| Staff recommendation is to deny the general commercial zone because of site constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| and because the existing planned commercial zone allows for site plan review by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| I am Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| Seeing no opposition, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| I represent Mr. Gilreath, who is the owner not only of this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| but the following three parcels as you're moving east on Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6429)|
| 1:47:17| Those three parcels, the frontage there to the floodway, are zoned CA general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| That last parcel to the east actually extends down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| It's about 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| That is his residence and is a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| He has an existing, I call it an automobile business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| It's really kind of road-ready or road-legal electric vehicles there on the property that is just to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6455)|
| 1:47:45| which is zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| He actually had to get that rezoned in 2018 from ag to CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| and the planning staff and planning commission at that time recommended planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| and county commission voted unanimously to allow that to be the CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6481)|
| 1:48:08| consistent with the other properties to the east, and generally that entire commercial node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| where the only non-CA commercial zoning present there is this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6492)|
| 1:48:19| which was zoned to PC in 2008, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| Staff has been consistent in the rezoning in this portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| I think they did support the CA to the northeast there that's on the map in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6510)|
| 1:48:37| but they have been consistent with the PC zone in their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| In going back and listening to the comments in county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| specifically David Wright, who was the commissioner at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| who was in the 8th district in 2018, and Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| this property had all been traditionally commercial property for many, many years, even before the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6533)|
| 1:49:00| Then when the zoning took place, it was in the rural area, and they applied the agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| and the property owners kept asking for it to go back to commercial, consistent with the previous uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| This is an existing commercial node where the only thing that really looks out of place on that map is the purple PC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6551)|
| 1:49:18| There are site constraints to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| There's a floodway that takes up a big portion of it, but even beyond that, you can see there's a little squiggly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| looks like a pond there, and there's some closed depressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| If you go to the aerial, you can see the front part of it has been cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| but that back part has remained kind of wooded because the topography there really doesn't allow there to be any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| The problem with the PC zone is it's generally intended for properties of 20 acres and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| There's a number of reasons for that, but the primary reason I was first retained not to seek a rezoning on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| but to look at doing a development plan for a use on review for the planned commercial zoning that existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| My client, Mr. Gilreath, is wanting to move his business to that parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| because there's a better location there on the corner between John Sevier Highway and Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6606)|
| 1:50:12| We hired an engineer to look at what would that look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| and he identified immediately a number of variances that would have to go before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| Even though you can make an argument there are very good justifications and hardships for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| if you've ever been before a Board of Zoning Appeals trying to make an argument for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| you know that's not guaranteed, and it's a significantly higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| So we pivoted at that point and asked for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| We knew it wouldn't be supported by staff, and we didn't want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| unless we really felt like that was the best option moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| Staff's rationale for it, again, has been consistent with past cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| The PC allows there to be review from this planning commission, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| There's additional landscaping requirements in the PC, and there would be a development plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| But when you look at the properties that would be affected that would benefit from that type of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| there's no opposition behind me on moving this to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| You've got industrial property that already has that landscaping buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| It's going to retain there because of the topography issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| There is a 50-foot buffer recommended from the John Sevier Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| and to the extent there's trees there, they will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| But the other properties are either owned by my client or already zoned CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| with the exception of some residential property across Strawberry Plains, which is a fairly wide area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6696)|
| 1:51:43| It was traditionally and kind of organically a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| It should remain a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| And though I'm appreciative of staff's concerns about public review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| it just seems like that really isn't necessary to protect the interests on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| So I'd ask that respectfully that you follow the applicant's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| and zone it CA consistent with the other commercial properties in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6733)|
| 1:52:20| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| I think I had made a comment or two at the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| I think the applicant's request appears reasonable and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| I would like to ask staff, had this been, and it may be a case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| and this is the reason I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Ms. Hanson, if this had been zoned something other than the prior requested PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| and an applicant came in with CA, do you think you would have viewed this any differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Ms. Porche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| So you're asking if it had been zoned anything other than PC if we were to support CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I mean, this was a requested rezoning prior for PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| Had this been ag or any other zoning and now requesting a CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6791)|
| 1:53:18| do you think you would have viewed it differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| That's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| I mean, there is examples of CA around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| but, again, we do try to be consistent with our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| And so when I was looking at the properties to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| and then looking at even the ag zone that's across Governor John Severe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| just looking at the different recommendations that we've made over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| we do try to remain consistent with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| And I think that the recommendations were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| the comments within the staff reports were still valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| And so we didn't feel like a change in our recommendation was warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| since there's not been a change of conditions to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| There are some CA zoned properties obviously around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| but we've not as a body, as an agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| recommended approval of any of the ones south on the south side of Strawberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| Plains due to those site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| In the PC zone, there is that 50-foot peripheral boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| So, you know, in measuring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| I believe it was like 500 feet of linear frontage on Strawberry Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| and measuring the western boundary to just that straight line bound before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6858)|
| 1:54:25| kind of dog legs out to that little triangle point on the bottom right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| So just measuring that top line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Yes, that one right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| It looked like that one had, let me get back on here and see what that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| So that's kind of what they're looking at in terms of, you know, buildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| I don't know what variances they would need, but, you know, to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| it seems like there's plenty of land to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| I think I missed something there in the middle of your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| You said something to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| Tell me what that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| So there was, let's see, on the other side of that PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| two dwelling units breaker to the left of the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| There's a property that's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| There's been two previous rezoning requests, and both of those were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| It's the one on the south side of Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| Skip one parcel over from the PR at 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| So the one with the blue line stream running through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| Yep, that one right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| So there's been two previous requests, and both of those were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| We were not recommending support of the, I believe it was CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| they were asking for at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| So just another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| I must be turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6940)|
| 1:55:41| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| Oh, sorry, west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| I keep saying east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Sorry, west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| And so on the other corners of the major intersection there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| Strawberry Plains Pike and John Sevier, we've got CA, CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6954)|
| 1:56:01| and then on that northeast corner, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| Ag, is ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| I mean, we do acknowledge that there is existing CA, so it's not out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| It's just our recommendations in the past have been to support the PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| You know, I guess when I look at this, I agree with what Michelle is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| but also I kind of see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| he can do what he wants to do with this piece of property under the PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| He's just trying to circumvent BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| You know, we have processes that are in place for this same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| You know, there's reasons why we have this, and it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| and if it requires him going through BZA, and I feel like there's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| I mean, BZA has been very accommodating with variances in the most recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| past, so, you know, I won't be supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| I do support staff's recommendation on this being PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| and staying PC and allowing him to go through BZA to get his variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| and allow for the additional oversight on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I was kind of in the same boat you were on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| You know, you are going to have that 50-foot buffer along John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| You've obviously got the buffer along the river at the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| and then you own the same piece to the east that is on CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| the whole intersection zone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| You know, that extra 50 feet on the front and whatever oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| in this particular location, you know, oversight is always nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| But here, practically, with the industrial across the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| and what all is going on, I just don't see the extra need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| So the East County Sector Plan would allow the CA zone that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| requesting, so I'm going to make a motion that we approve the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| We've got a motion by Vice Chair Uten to approve CA zone requested by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7091)|
| 1:58:20| seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| And we still have lights on, so let's go with Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| Would Commissioner Uten be open to adding the condition to maintain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| 50-foot landscape buffer to be consistent with the corridor plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7115)|
| 1:58:43| I don't think that's anything that we can waive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| I think that's on the property regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| because it's on the John Severe Highway piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| so I think that would be inherent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| and that's something that they're going to have to honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| I think that's something that we've had to add as a condition for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| them, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| My understanding is it's part of the corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| and that was part of the conversation in 2018 with the property to the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| and I'm sorry if I'm jumping in and breaking the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| Go ahead, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| But that was part of the conversation at County Commission is with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| corridor study being in place and helping protect some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| that they were more comfortable with just the general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| being in this intersection than the planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| Could we get some clarification from staff on the requirements for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| I think it would be helpful if our colleagues from Knox County would –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7171)|
| 1:59:36| sorry, Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| When properties come in for development along this particular corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| how do you all handle the requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Kelly reviews these for compliance with zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| and he would reach out to planning staff to ensure that any buffer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| would be required that we provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| Do you think that it's necessary for this body to put in an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| My staff will be on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| I actually have a question regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| So it's an adopted plan, but in the plan it's more should language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| like recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| It's not – it doesn't say shall, like required language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| So I believe that's why we've asked for it as a condition in previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| But, you know, that's just my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| So I will reach out to my colleagues just to ask that question if that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| correct assumption on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| That's one of the reasons I asked Mr. Elliott how they handled those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| If it is a recommendation and you do want the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| then I would say we need to add it here because we would only enforce it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| a shall condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| So what was the recommended buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| Is it 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| It's 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| And the way that the study says, it talks about a tree buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| but in instances where there's commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| there is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| some imagery that kind of allows more shrubs and things like that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| allows the business to be seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| but it just requires some sort of landscaping within that 50 feet just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| because it's a scenic highway to add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| the greenery and aesthetics of the rural trees and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| So since the question is still on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| Chair, and I didn't know you could make the conditional rezoning in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| county like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| But if that is the wish of code enforcement and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| I will go ahead and put the shall in case there's any doubt and put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| we would honor the corridor studies recommendation of the 50 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| So that would be an amendment to your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| That would be an amendment to my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| And we have an agreed second from Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| We clear on what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7325)|
| 2:02:06| We have, give me a count, Mr. DeArmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| I mean, not a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| We had two opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| 12-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| I think earlier today I shorted the total amount of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7337)|
| 2:02:23| Did I not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7349)|
| 2:02:30| Then strike that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7353)|
| 2:02:42| Next is agenda item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| The applicant is Thunder Mountain Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| Location southwest side of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7373)|

| 2:03:42| compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7422)|

| 2:04:06| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7446)|

| 2:05:53| This property is located in South Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| somewhat near the county line along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| The South County sector plan, which is applicable in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| contemplates several areas being designated for mixed land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| The rationale behind this contemplation is the changing conditions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| certain areas over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| Special land use districts are to be located in areas that have good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| transportation systems and necessary infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| The mixed use specialty district, South County 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| which is the South Knox County, known as the South Knox County gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| This property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| the request for this property is a minor extension of that sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| The adjacent property to the West, which you can see on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| includes the same designation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| There is a existing shopping center and a golf driving range and on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| portion of the property and on a portion of property on the North side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| Chapman Highway, as you can see there near Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| South County sector plan recommends a diverse range of uses for this mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| use specialty district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Those include retail office and low or medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| The sector plan also provides zoning recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| including commercial office and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| Commercial zoning is the predominant zoning for the properties within this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| mixed use specialty district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| Planning staff at the agenda review meeting, as you may recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| explained the likelihood or reason this property wasn't included within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7656)|
| 2:07:43| mixed use specialty district at the time that this sector plan was last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| amended was because there were safety concerns along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| Those safety concerns mainly related to site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| Since that prior amendment or since the last amendment of the South County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| TDOT has constructed substantial improvements to Chapman Highway in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7680)|
| 2:08:06| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| These improvements have alleviated these safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| They realigned certain sections and now there's five lanes of travel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| You have two eastbound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7699)|
| 2:08:20| two westbound and now a continuous center turn lane in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7703)|
| 2:08:24| It's also a deceleration lane, as you can see on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| I guess that's to the east of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| Utilities have been expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| including new water lines and new gas line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| As for the requested rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| requested rezoning from a low density residential RA to general commercial CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| for a portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| Approximately 7.9 acres of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| as you can see on the screen, is already currently zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| Although 7.9 acres sounds like a substantial amount of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| the road frontage width for this piece is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| With that 7.9 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| no meaningful commercial development could really be developed based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| existing layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| That's why we're asking for an extension of that CA zone for a portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| This request for the CA is an additional 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| The rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| if the sector plan is amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| would be consistent with that mixed-use specialty district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| Planning staff recommends approval of the rezoning CA subject to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| and that one condition is that prior to any project going forward for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| permitting or construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| that we have to come back to Planning Commission for development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7785)|
| 2:09:46| which we're agreeable to that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| This is a requirement under the South County sector plan for the mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| specialty district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| This will address one of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| There are several comments on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| but this will address one of the comments whose opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| was not essentially to the commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| but the fact that commercial zoning with site plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| as provided in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| site plan review isn't as extensive and doesn't have the requirements of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| certain attributes that a development plan review will have under the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| And one of those that the comments pointed out was landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| So table 12 of the South County sector plan does set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7830)|
| 2:10:36| the additional requirements that are associated with this development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| Those are landscaping, exterior lighting, architectural design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| parking, signage, and then access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| We ask that you follow staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| amend the sector plan to the mixed-use specialty district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| as well as rezone this portion of the property to CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| and it'd be for a portion of the property in the sector plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| Ms. Grace, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| Hi, Margie Grace, Grace Design Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| but I'm here representing the dry hollow community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| 841 residents around this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| I have been in contracting and construction for 47 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| 25 of which have been under my own contractor's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| And I am internationally recognized twice as international landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| designer of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| So I have some expertise in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| I'm also a published author on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| So I come offering some expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| and I actually brought you some handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| The first one that you'll see, it's got highlighted in yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| and it pertains to this M measure that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| the rezoning that's labeled M, and this sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| this GH as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| And I presented that just briefly to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| and hoped that he would consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| And so I want to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| this property owner owns 400 acres in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| nearly 400 acres in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| And I'm going to refer you to the slide up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| that is in the zoning report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| the report from the, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| there's a paper shuffle afloat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| I'm famous for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| Okay, so we want to look at the other proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7963)|
| 2:12:50| who does this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| This guy right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| Okay, who's putting these things up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| All right, so what's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| and it was tabled for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| but that you can see the opposite side of the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| where the ballpark is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| you have some two other zoning, rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| and there is also a sector plan amendment request on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| And if we could see the whole slide at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| And then you can also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| but I think the ones across the street have been tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| They have been tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| But what you need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| is there are two sides of the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| that are in play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| And it really doesn't merit talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| We won't talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| but just know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| and this is related rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| It's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| It is afoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| This land will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| And we welcome development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| but we also just spent some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| with Advanced Knox as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| putting together what we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| designing a future for our own selves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| And we envision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| here we are at the south gateway to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| And what if this is just something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| to be incredibly proud of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| What if this is a place where everybody stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| and leaves their tax dollars here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| their sales tax dollars here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| What if there's a restaurant there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| instead of all of us going south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| to five seconds away to the other county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| where there are restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| What I'm after is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| what the community is asking for at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| is to postpone the small parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| that we're looking at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| It's a single parcel that's the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| of both M and N there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| with the accompanying sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| That is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| we'd like to consider alternates to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| The rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| and that is in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| if you'll look at the handout that I gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| and you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| I'm going to direct you first to page two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| that little hand numbered in the left corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| And then you can see there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| that that parcel just to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| in the slide above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| that has the SC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| yes, that also is owned by one of the members of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8111)|
| 2:15:14| so the owner who's making the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| is B. Chris Arnold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| Thunder Mountain Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| And then this is owned by an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| owned by B. Chris Arnold as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| It's already zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| for the gateway to the South County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8128)|
| 2:15:30| And it is ripe for redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| which is a stated priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| in your rezoning report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| as well as the sector plan amendment report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| And I think that it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| to talk about the whole gig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| Then I'm going to refer you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| to the next page of the exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| that I've handed you is number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| that shows that large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| requested, or the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| MUSD zoning for the South County gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| And then if you'll look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| PP land there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| that is being asked to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| Currently it's public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| And I understand that that's tabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| but what the whole goal of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| is that we not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| we not be a community given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| by piecemeal thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| That is the whole entire goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| because those of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| who have invested in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| we have a contract with our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| And we moved in with the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| that are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| and we're having that absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| disappeared right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| Okay, so here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| We'll look at the proposed page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Ma'am, we're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| I will show you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| If the applicant would like to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| How much more time do you need, Ms. Grace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| I'll give you two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| If you look at the page one of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| this thing right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| this leaves...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| We would ask you to leave the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| that there is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| exactly the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| and exactly the way that it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| And go ahead with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| We show one of the stated goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| of the advanced NOx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| is to get a variety of price ranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| And we show here in this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| we leave the commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| and they can rezone if they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| You might consider rezoning that to housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| with a landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| for our gateway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| to the south county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| Then you look at some intensive housing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| in the 18 townhouse multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| You get 34 single-family residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| 18 townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| and this is just my first, you know, brain dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8262)|
| 2:17:45| You've got a pocket park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| You've got green belts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| You can walk to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| one of the stated goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| that we're looking for sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| walkability, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| I really would like to also point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| errors in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| Climb is not allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| but there are actual problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| with the inaccuracies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| within the zoning report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| and plan amendment report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| And cheap of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| is that the prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| the warranted change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| a change of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| is based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| something that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| was implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| in the year 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| but was proposed and envisioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| prior to our last plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| our last sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| So it is not a change condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| If it's envisioned 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| but not acted on until now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8320)|
| 2:18:42| it is not a change of condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| There's a lawsuit coming about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| and so we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| that you kindly also review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240111?start=8328)|
