| 0:01:29| Welcome to those in attendance and those watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Tonight we have a presentation by key members of the city staff and KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| about incentives that we use for creative development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| and to incentivize development priorities for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| We have a presentation that has been shared with council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| and will be posted online soon for the public to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| But for now I'll hand the mic over to city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| and Ben Bentley with KCDC who will give our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| I encourage council members to ask questions throughout the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| or at the end, whichever you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| So over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Hey, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Thank you for asking for an update on our incentive tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| and how they work and how we utilize those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| to get the best development in Knoxville as we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| We're going to review with the city of Knoxville team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| and the KCDC team what those tools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| and what our key development priorities are that guide the utilization of those tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| We'll go over our team and what each person's role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| We'll also address the key development priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| We've referenced those quite a bit as you've seen incentive projects come before you in council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| so we'll summarize those in one place tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| We'll also go through each of the types of tools for incentivizing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| And then to wrap up, we'll give a few examples of public-private partnership specific projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| that are actually happening in Knoxville because of these tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=195)|
| 0:03:24| First off, the city of Knoxville team, I'm RJ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| and I'm the chief of the urban design and development team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| Our group is small and mighty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| Small and mighty, we have Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| She is a planner, and she is a project director within our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| And Wes Soward is urban wilderness coordinator and also special projects director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| So our team is really the front door of having conversations with folks that are interested in private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=229)|
| 0:03:59| or special partnerships with the city for creative projects in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| So whether that's a park, whether that's a multifamily project with a shared parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| so all different sorts of opportunities that we really try to set the stage for unique partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| where we both bring our strengths to the table and see how we can bring these projects to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| So just a few projects that are also in our office that aren't necessarily incentive-based projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=265)|
| 0:04:33| but still special private partnerships are all the work in the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| Wes has been taking the reins there and bringing those projects to life, like the Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| Also the First Creek Greenway and the McClung Warehouse site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Liz has been leading those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| So we work very integrally with the city departments and our agency partners like KCDC and Knox Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| So although there are just a few of us, we have a lot of different expertise we pull in to bring these projects to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=301)|
| 0:05:11| Ben, I'll let you introduce your team, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| Yeah, yeah, you caught me mid-drink. That was embarrassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Ben Bentley, good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| So a couple of our folks, as RJ said, City of Knoxville, front door, vision, conceptual development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| really everything you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| We're more of the implementation entity, so we can operationalize some of the tools we're going to be talking about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| so more of the back-end type work but still very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| And my folks are fantastic. They're all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| So Jim Hatfield is the VP of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Some of you all probably met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| He's good at everything development-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| And I should say on the front end, this is both city incentive-type projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| and then when we're self-developing First Creek at Austin, transforming Western, those kinds of activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| this team is also responsible for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| So it's a great benefit to the city, the work that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| Patricia Clement is Senior Project Manager, Capital Projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| so she does a lot of our nitty-gritty project management on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| David Cook, you all probably know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| I think we may have disinvited David tonight, so I don't see him back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| but he's Redevelopment Administrator, been with KCDC and then the city of Knoxville before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| does a lot of work and knows all the rules of redevelopment plans and redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Thomas Bleeker is Senior Development Analyst, does a lot of tracking, financials, analysis, spreadsheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| And then Rachel Maples, Attorney by Training, Project Manager, Real Estate Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| I didn't know that was her title, but that's a cool title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| She really helps us directly administer the IDB, among many other things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| So that's a little bit of our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I feel like we complement and supplement the team of the city pretty well and work well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=410)|
| 0:06:59| So just to go over those two teams, along with all of our other agency partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| as needed with their expertise and our city departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| in partnership with a private developer or another stakeholder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| we really put together a team to bring, like I keep saying, bring these projects to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| When we all bring what we're good at or what resources we have to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| that's when we are able to create these unique packages to really see the vision through to complement growth in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=445)|
| 0:07:37| Hi, I'm Liz, and I'll be going through what our key development priorities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| So these are what we use to evaluate the public-private partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| The city has established these key development priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| and they essentially provide a checklist to base our review of projects or requesting assistance from local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| So we have a list of preferred project types you see listed as point number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| and that includes expanded housing supply, vertical mixed uses, ground floor activation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| promoting pedestrian activity, as well as commercial projects that support job growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| and align with one of our partners, the Chamber's path to prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| Project location is also critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| So we look at existing redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| So these are the spaces that we identify with our partners at KCDC for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| So locating in those areas is preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Sites that include blight remediation are also preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| as well as those that are located along our transit corridors for CAT buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Our project characteristics include historic preservation and restoration and reuse of historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=535)|
| 0:09:04| Also, we really look at projects that are programmatically or architecturally distinctive, innovative or creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=544)|
| 0:09:14| So if it's an interesting mix of uses or will help provide a new significant development for an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=554)|
| 0:09:26| we also look at incorporating other environmentally friendly and sustainable engineering practices as part of our preferred projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=566)|
| 0:09:38| And then finally, we also look at making sure that overall these projects are integrating well with our existing community amenities and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=578)|
| 0:09:49| So that includes our existing and proposed public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| So connecting to our parks and greenways as well as proposing new parks and greenways as part of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| or something that we also look at as being a preferred development type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Projects that are leveraging recent city investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So those located along streets that have recently been improved or along our new streetscape projects such as Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=611)|
| 0:10:20| We also look at projects that widen the supply of smart parking, structured parking and shared parking options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=620)|
| 0:10:30| And then again, we really try to focus on projects that are furthering our capacity to have a transportation network that's multimodal and using alternative transportation such as biking and walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=630)|
| 0:10:49| We also have a map that we have developed along with our colleagues at Knoxville-Knox County Planning and KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=649)|
| 0:11:00| So on this map, you can visualize and actually see where our public-private partnerships have been located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| So this includes both our TIFs and our pilots that we'll go into a little bit more detail on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| We also have on here where our existing redevelopment projects are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| So when you click on one of the TIF or pilot projects, you can zoom into Google Street View and it'll show you where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=681)|
| 0:11:30| This example is Stockyard Lofts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| You can also turn on and off our active capital projects so you can see how those align with some of these existing TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=694)|
| 0:11:45| So the Old City streetscapes runs within this redevelopment area that's being highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| This is Magnolia Avenue Warehouse District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| So this is what we work with in partnership with KCDC on to establish the redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=714)|
| 0:12:03| We also, yes, try to align our capital improvement projects with these areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| And you can turn those on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| And if you've never looked at this tool before, I really encourage you to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| It's on the Urban Design and Development website, that section of the City of Knoxville webpages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=737)|
| 0:12:26| So please look at it and it will help understand sort of where some of these investments are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| And now I'll turn it over to RJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| And just one more note about this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| It became very obvious that we needed a tool to be able to not only plan with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| but communicate all of these key development priorities graphically with developers interested in investing in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=770)|
| 0:13:00| and developers outside of Knoxville and just people that work in partnership with anyone investing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| Is that feedback funny for anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Maybe pause real fast to see if we can decide where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| No one talk, it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| I was afraid it was just in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| I'm glad to know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| Okay, so that mapping tool has become really useful for us, not only internally to communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| but I think we've even used it to have conversations with a few of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| And just a lot of folks have been able to have a glance into Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| and how all of these key development priorities align to showcase where we're seeing development happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| and where we need development to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| So all that to say, we have our key development priorities that set the stage for conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| and really vetting projects and combining them with the appropriate tool for incentivizing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=841)|
| 0:14:09| This is a list of projects that we're going to go through, how they work in each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| Redevelopment areas, tax increment financing, pilots, payment in lieu of tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| and low-income housing tax credit pilots, development agreements for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| and capital project infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| So a little bit about establishing redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| and then we're going to get into a specific case study on that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| So initially it starts with a request from council typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| So you all have seen the Magnolia, the extension of the Magnolia Corridor redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| and we've talked to you about that recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| At that point, once council requests a redevelopment area be created by KCDC and under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| we are the entity that can create those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| We create a draft plan, post that for viewing for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| It's usually 30 days, and it would be posted both at our site and at the city of Knoxville's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| typically the urban design and development office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| And then there's a public hearing that once people have had time to sort of digest that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| it's open for anybody that wants to attend that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| And then beyond that, and I'm making these sound really quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| there's some time in between all of this, is approval by the city of Knoxville, you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| and the KCDC board to finalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Just real quickly about why redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Typically they unlock several tools under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| The main one is tax increment finance in redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| as well as certain authorities for land acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| There are some TDEC grants for environmental purposes that are available in those areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| So even more importantly than that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| I think it's an indicator or a signifier that this is a priority area for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| that they want to see something happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| So it has both a practical application, the tools that are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| and then also there's just a significance to it when we put it in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| because people recognize this is a place that the city wants to see something occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| So just a little bit about our redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| There they are shown on the aforementioned map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| And you can see, I think the biggest highlight of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| we can always create a new one if there is an area that needs additional attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| But I think most of the projects that we have seen over the last, and I can say seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| have been included in one of the existing redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| There may be one or two exceptions to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| but these really are most of the major corridors coming out of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| and the downtown area are included in an existing redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I want to have a question just on this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| If you could go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| So we went over the four types of priorities for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| These are the redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| What are the general criteria you look for in addition to those general priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| that make a redevelopment area a good idea, other than the whim of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| Yeah, so I think historically you would look at areas that are either underinvested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| or there could be an argument made for areas that are being quickly invested in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| but there's some reason to, I don't want to use the word constraint, but to guide the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| So I think that maybe let's use the South Waterfront, your district, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| I think when it was 2006 when the vision plan and the redevelopment area were put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| that was an area that needed additional investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| I think at this point you could make the second argument that I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| which is the growth is happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| That document is really guiding that growth in the form of both the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| and the form-based code that came out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| So there are a number of criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| The first one would be are there blighted structures and or vacant underutilized parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| land that could be better put to use, environmentally challenged parcels, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| In the second case it would be where are we seeing growth on a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| where it's currently unfettered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Is that a word, unfettered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| I use words that I don't know sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| There's growth that's happening quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| and how do we guide that in a way that is in alignment with the City of Knoxville's priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| Do you consider state or federal programs on the horizon or current that influence that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| Historically, as I mentioned, there are some TDOT grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| and some TDOT grants that do emphasize redevelopment areas as a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| So yes, in terms of the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| there have not been programs that have specifically spoke to redevelopment areas in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| So the answer is partially yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I wanted to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Outside of this area that we are looking at here that is not close in to the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1144)|
| 0:19:14| perhaps like around Clinton Highway merchant area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1154)|
| 0:19:22| when is the last time we as a city have created redevelopment areas in that area of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| So I'm going to speak and then please chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| In the seven years that I have lived here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| those corridors that are further out have not been explored for redevelopment area purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| I know in terms of planning and other efforts, there probably have been something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| but not for the tools of a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Do you have a sense of why that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Well, I think part of it, this is going to be a not great answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| but I think some of it is cyclical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| And so emphasis on late 90s, early 2000s, downtown was the emphasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| The last ten years, and I'm painting broad brushes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| the last ten years, corridors leaving downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| so think Sevier, Chapman, Magnolia, Central, Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| those types of areas have been the focal point of both redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| and then developer interest, private sector interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| And I think right now we're about to see a time where further out Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| further out Chapman, some of the areas that you're mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| will be hopefully potential spots for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Those are great corridors with existing transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Even if people have to get in a car, there's some opportunity out there to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| So, yeah, that's a fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| I also think of areas of East Knoxville towards East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| where the county is now projecting further growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| When we as a city think about where to prioritize for redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| what should we be thinking when we think about an area further away from downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| but potentially preparing to see a lot more growth in future years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| So I think that there's a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| We do not have the authority without the county requesting us to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| to put in a redevelopment area for a county parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| but obviously there's going to be a county area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| but there is a lot of growth that's happening in those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| So as part of the infrastructure planning for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| there should be an alignment, whether you call it a redevelopment area or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| with the places where we see growth, both commercial and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| and the infrastructure that's going into those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| And I think there is some thought both from the county and obviously from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| in terms of how we do that, but we at KCDC would only do that if the county asked us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Right, and I think my question was misunderstood a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| but just thinking like we've seen the county's planning process for future land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| Is this a time for the city to think about redevelopment areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| outside of just our major corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| and maybe an area that ties more into future county development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| I think that's a great point, and I actually think that the extension of Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| is a really good first example of that, but there are many others that need to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| and I think it's a direct acknowledgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| The first area we established, I'm pointing to the Magnolia Avenue Warehouse District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| was very downtown adjacent, and now we have extended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| It's going to extend if we can put a plan forth that gets approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| and serves the community down to Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| and there are a number of opportunities on corridors to do similar things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| I have another quick question that's a little off topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| in terms of looking at the tools that we are using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| How are we using our Industrial Development Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| So that is predominantly for tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| and I'm definitely going to cover some of that in a subsequent slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| but that's really pilots are the main tool that is utilized currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| All right, so I think most of you are familiar with TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| We once again will do a case study toward the end on a specific project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| but it is the idea that whether you're reinvesting in an existing structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| or building something new, the additional taxes that come with that new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| or that rehabilitation can be used to borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| in order to fund typically public infrastructure is what is funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| So it could be in some cases sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| It could be parking that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| There are a number of different public infrastructure uses under state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| but the basic concept is new tax increment funds a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| of the public infrastructure associated with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| And you all stop me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Sometimes I don't make sense to myself, so I know I don't make sense to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Pilots, so payment in lieu of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| and there are two entities in the city that really do tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| so the Industrial Development Board for pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| that are not in the affordable housing realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| and you all have approved several of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| and we'll talk about a case study of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| But the core project along Cumberland, Ridge House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| which is the former SunTrust Bank on a hill and the RAP housing right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| and there are numerous other ones as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| In another part of state law, in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Pilot Program was initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| and that was really a response to appraisers across the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| starting to value affordable properties like they were valuing market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| The challenge there is that affordable properties are not market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| and they cannot sustain the massive tax bill that was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| So in 2015, the state legislature changed the law to allow for housing authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| and a few other entities, but here we do it as KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| to be able to provide tax abatement for any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| either existing but doing a rehab or new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| that's going to utilize low income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| Councilman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| I think you might need to turn your mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Can you hear me there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Yeah, you have to use that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| So Industrial Development Board is negotiating pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| What about any land acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Is IDB doing any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| So IDB could do some of that, especially in they really are designed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| historically, industrial projects that would be a little bit outside the urban core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| but they could do acquisition as well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Oh, interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| But they could focus on the urban core, but just traditionally have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| I'm ready for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| All right, and the next one is you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| So development agreements are a tool that we utilize in order to work with a private developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| on implementing public resources and infrastructure that's either adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| or within private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| So the developer, in a nutshell, the developer agrees to build the public amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| or build shared parking resources or public space within private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| within their own private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| So it sounds very simple, but, again, these all start with a lot of negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| and going through our key development priorities and evaluating where do we, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| if we're working through a structured parking shared use agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| what areas could benefit from this and why, and that's just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| We've also built public green space with a private development or greenway corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| So there's a lot of opportunities and flexibility with development agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| where it's really more efficient construction-wise and dollar-wise for one construction team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1667)|
| 0:27:56| to mobilize and implement a public-private partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| Similar but a little bit different is when the city implements plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| and implements a capital infrastructure investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| So through planning and budgeting, for example, a streetscape project really sets the stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| for private investment along a corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| You can look back at the first phase of Magnolia Avenue, at North Central Street, Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| just a few that when we did the streetscape projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| we have intended for that to be a catalyst for private investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| and we've got some really impressive feedback from developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| on-the-ground feedback, as you can see, in a lot of spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| And I'll mention too, like Sutry Landing Park was one of those catalyst capital project infrastructure investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| that it's not always streetscapes, but it can be public spaces, it can be public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| like improved stormwater or utilities that improve an area so that private development is encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| and invited to invest in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| Yes, and I got ahead of myself and touched on a little bit of this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| but as you can see, it takes an entity under state law to hold a property in order to make tax abatement legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| So the two entities we utilize to do that here locally are the Housing Authority, KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| And as I mentioned before, the affordable pilots tend to flow through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| or do flow through KCDC and the more private market rate sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| or really any commercial use that's not affordable flows through the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| I have a general question about all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Can you talk a little bit about the, what I've noticed is some of the recent agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| we've built in a certain timeline that provides a sense of urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| I think for most of these incentives there's a presumed sense of urgency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| but we've also granted pilots or incentives where things sit for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| So can you talk about either the administration or KCDC's focus now on near-term horizon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| for construction start, for completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| And I'm going to actually maybe defer to RJ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| because I think you were talking about putting specific timelines in place for council to approve, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| in terms of the pilot agreements on the front end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| So I think your question kind of can be answered twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Like you're right, developers are always in a hurry, if you haven't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| And we know that there's a balance of timing and planning to go through the entitlement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1849)|
| 0:30:59| to go through the due diligence process, to go through solidifying financing plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| So often the pilot resolution, as approved by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| is a significant influence on a developer and development team going to get their financing solidified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1870)|
| 0:31:21| So that's often why you see a project come before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| and then there's a two-year construction period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| but it might take two and a half years to really complete before the pilot starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| because after they receive their council resolution, they went to finalize their financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| and it didn't take one week, it took one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| I'm trying to maybe oversimplify it, but am I speaking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Yeah, that's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| But then there's also, so from that time, it usually takes us about six months to a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| from that first conversation with the development team until we get to council approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| So if you think of that planning time, too, from those initial cost estimates that they submitted to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| for all of the underwriting purposes, they sometimes have to go out and refresh some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| So it's balancing, after they solidify their financing, it's balancing their books, mobilizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| So it's quite a dance of timelines, so that gives a little bit of perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| But also we have those times to begin the project in the pilot agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| and often we will have developers say, we need an extension for three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| we need an extension for six months, and we always, you know, we don't say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| We often ask why and what are the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| So usually there's very contextual reasons where it is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| and it's because of different market conditions or conversations they're having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| to set all the pieces in place to begin construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Okay, I just want to applaud that and encourage you all to use that as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| Without incentives, there are plenty of properties, to my dismay, that get rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| and then sit for five years or four years that don't necessarily get an incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| but instilling a sense of urgency formally into the agreement, I think, is a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Just following up on that, I also think part of the timeline sense of urgency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| I like the review process, and I'm going to believe that you don't always say yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| because part of the timeline thing is we don't want people to line all this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| tie up property, and just sit on it, which is I know what you're meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| I just don't want folks to think, well, any reason is good enough, because we have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| not necessarily, but one that comes to mind a lot that people think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| and I can't remember all the financing tools, is the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| There was hope, the economy hit, financing changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| and it begins to cause angst with the community why all this is tied up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| I also think the timing piece that we've started being much tighter on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| is how long you get before you start paying it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| because that's the real driver where the city sees the benefit of giving the incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| is so that sooner rather than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| the city starts benefiting from the appreciated value of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| that we incentivized and made financially able to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| So that's more of a comment than a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| but I really think it's twofold when we talk about the timing pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| We seem to have shortened the length of time we give a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| but that's because the market doesn't require as long as it did 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| for the value to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| So I do think as more and more develops, that time gets shorter and shorter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| and eventually people won't need them in the heavily developed areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| and we will be able to do more further out in places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| that we haven't been able to do them so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Adding on to that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| the flip side of that is when we're using these incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| to get a certain type of development, like workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| And, you know, the shorter the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| the less time we can hold them to maintaining workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2147)|
| 0:35:57| And, you know, ultimately if they sell the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| it goes back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| and they're not obligated to maintain that workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| So I always try to keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| when thinking about how these incentives can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and benefit our city and what are their limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| I did wonder with the IDB, do we have access, is it online somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| a list of all of the properties that are currently owned by IDB, currently held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2185)|
| 0:36:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| So there is a list of the existing pilot agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| that are held in name for tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| The landholding IDB for really the entire area was the county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| That was a decision that was made under the Development Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| So a lot of the industrial parks and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| that are in the county outside of the city were held by the county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| In terms of specific land assets held by the city IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| with the exception of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| there's Regal headquarters in the parking garage associated with One River Walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| There's the downtown cinema, which is actually its own IDB and financing mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| but it is technically held as a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| But beyond that, we do not have individual parcels or industrial parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| Gotcha. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| And so, Ben, I think you may have answered partially my question in that last response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| because I wanted to ask about non-governmental properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| that are leased to non-governmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| And so you mentioned, like, the Regal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| So is that a lease example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I just needed that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Is this me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| First case study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| So this is the 200 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| And this is actually a great segue from the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| that we just had on timing of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| So this was an RFP that went out in 2019 or 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| There was a lot of work to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| There was an existing 50-year surface parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| parking lease associated with Sturkey Lofts on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| and a lot of work to get that removed in order for this to create redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| that would connect the 100 block to the rest of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| improve walkability, provide some housing, and extend the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| And all of those things were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| No project is perfect, but it's going to add a lot to our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| And you can see the stats there, $30 million in private investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| The point that I was making, though, in terms of timing, so 2019 happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| and then the RFP was, you know, COVID went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| We had already made a selection under the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| and interest rates and everything associated with the project went crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| And so we, in that case, to your point, Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| we had to show the developer, for legitimate reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| some grace and provide some extensions in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| So there are very specific project reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| in a lot of times where we provide some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Another good example on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| there was some earthwork that needed to be excavated that was unknown at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Even with extensive geotechnical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| you don't always catch everything that's under the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| And so there's a little bit of flexibility that was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| for the completion date on the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| due to that extension of needing to excavate and do additional earthwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| So all of these processes are difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| both from the development standpoint and then from our teams working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| We try to use a practical approach to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| if there is a project that can happen, it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| And you can see 53 units, 49 of those are condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| four are workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| It's a little quirky to mix four rentals in with a condo deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| that's not meant to be an excuse or a reason not to try to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| but it does when you start mixing rental with ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| it gets a little trickier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| But those are the stats on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And you can see the development priorities that it aligns with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| This is the Old City streetscaped area and the multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| The public-private partnership focus here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| is capital improvements and development agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| So with this project, the image on the right that has multiple colors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| shows all the different phases of the public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| around the multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| And the graphic on the left shows one of the city's capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| that complements the rest of the public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| So in this area, there are multiple phases and multiple funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| whether they are state or capital investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| that will build out and upgrade the utilities and the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| the stormwater, the public access, the transit, the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| the streetscapes in this area around the stadium area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| connecting Old City to East Knoxville to make this a complete project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| So also, as I mentioned before, for efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| the construction team on site is implementing the public infrastructure piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| because they're already mobilized, they already have teams on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| and phasing those timelines together with the other work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| is much more seamless and time-efficient and also cost-efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| So in terms of the case study for the redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| and we really could talk about Magnolia Avenue warehouse districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| or we could talk about the proposed extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| the tools that are useful in that area, as you all know the area better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| there are a lot of underutilized buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Historically, there were warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| There are some great buildings in use and some great existing businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| so that's not meant to say that there aren't things happening in that zone that are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| But tax increment finance is very good for the rehabilitation of structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| and there are some structures that need additional capital attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| So both in the warehouse district and the corridor along Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| given the aging structures in place, the use of tax increment finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| and the fact that there are likely to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| in terms of the need to clear title and acquire some land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| that maybe has either been held by various parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| or maybe there are many parties that own it and nothing's being done with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| the redevelopment tools that we will put in place there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| will enable us to get really better use out of the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| adjacent to transit on a major commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| All right, one more case study here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Caswell Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| So I know you all are familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| but this is a great example of the low-income housing tax credit pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| that runs through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| I would just highlight that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| there were significant City of Knoxville funds outside of that LIHTC pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| that went toward this permanent supportive housing deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| You can see a little bit about that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| It's interesting to note the Affordable Housing Trust funds from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| which really go toward development of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| and then the project-based vouchers from KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| really subsidize the operations of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| For permanent supportive housing to be financially viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| you're going to need both of those sources in a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| So this is a really good example of partnerships in the city stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2626)|
| 0:43:57| Oh, me. Look at that. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| I didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| So this is along Cumberland Hub, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| CORE is the group that is really developing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And you can see key development priorities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| so housing supply is the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| 2,000 beds, student housing, and the growth of UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| are affecting a lot of different neighborhoods in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| and so we are trying to encourage the addition of student housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| in places that are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| So 2,000 beds, 2,000 parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| the continuation of commercial at street level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| and then there was a pretty innovative partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| with Covenant and East Tennessee Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| to provide structured parking on the surface lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| that some of this project took place on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| So it's good for both of them in terms of replacing and increasing parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| but not having surface parking lots throughout Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| Thanks. I'm going to skip ahead one slide and then go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| sticking to Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| The Cumberland Avenue streetscape project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| was a capital improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| that a city investment really set the stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| for improved pedestrian safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| improved pedestrian experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| activating the streetscape in a better and safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| more productive way for businesses to thrive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| but also addressing vehicular efficiency along this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| Like Ben said, it's the investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| the city investment in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| We upgraded utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| We put power underground here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| So our total investment was around $25 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| and we've seen around a billion dollars in private investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| and 4,000 beds of housing and increased street-level retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| and much more structured parking to accommodate this growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| and shared parking resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| So all in all, we feel like the investment in Cumberland Avenue streetscapes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| has really helped us to be able to address some of the housing challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| along Cumberland Avenue and adjacent to the university| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Councilman Fugate has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you. I don't expect anybody to know this off the top of their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| This is just I would be interested to know with the investment we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| and the $1 billion in investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| how much property tax revenue should go up due to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| since the city gets property tax on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| And just be curious because I think as we talk about the benefit of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2800)|
| 0:46:50| part of it is we benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| The growth is good. Students get housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| But if it's privately held, then it's taxed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| that people pay property tax at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| So I just think it would be interesting to kind of know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| what the property tax value was prior to the city's investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| And now with this investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| how much additional tax revenue will the city benefit from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| Like I said, I don't expect anybody to know it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2839)|
| 0:47:21| but I would be interested to best guesstimate what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| And I will give an anecdote real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| For the core development that we just talked about, the $530 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| the city's portion of that off the top of my head was about $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| That's a five-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| So at year six after construction and completion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| you get an infusion of significant city new tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| That's kind of like, how much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| That's kind of what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| Are you telling me it's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I'm telling you that on that one project it's $4.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| but we can extrapolate and get you an estimate based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| That's what I'd be interested in knowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| because I think it would help us see the multiplier effect of that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| I also agree that that would be good to see in totality once the pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| expire on projects in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| I did have another question, thinking about development agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Do we not have a timeline in place for the museum development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2911)|
| 0:48:43| There are timelines in place for that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| and specifically it's based on the demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| There's a timeline for the demolition right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| The specifics of everything in that development agreement I don't know on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| the top of my head, but there are timelines in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| in all of our development agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| that most often guide when the work has to start and when the work has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| completed by, and then some sort of clawback parameter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| And generally, once city council approves a development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| if those timelines are not met, would that come back before city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| Or is that something that you all are able to handle without our additional approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| If the timelines are not met, then the agreement is no longer in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| If there's a new agreement or a certain level of amendment to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| agreement, then in certain conditions it would come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| But at some times you all are able to give some grace without it coming back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| When someone says they need 30 more days to finish a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| there are certain parameters of how we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| But if they need six more years and $30 million more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| it's all relative to what the agreement was in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| Okay, I'm going to jump back to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| This is a project recently brought before council and approved for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| But what I really wanted to focus on on this parcel was how we were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| work with this development team on cleaning up kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| for lack of a better way to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| just a mess of entitlements here from heavy industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| This was the former PSC Metals site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| and there's quite a lot of environmental situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| There's also, you can see all the parcels here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| So PSC Metals was operating on this area without it truly being appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| So once the developer purchased all of the parcels here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| we began to work with them on closing right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| and cleaning up some parcels that had questionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| or ownership that wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| We also worked with TDOT on cleaning up some right-of-way where we did the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| investment on the Marion Street improvements along with the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| So we were able to work with multiple entities to clear up titles on this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| and work to get all of those parcels within one brownfield agreement in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| for development to take place to clean up this site and repurpose this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| into a more productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| So, you know, all of that to say that's where a lot of the behind-the-scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| work goes on between the urban design and development staff, the KCDC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| and working with TDOT, working with title insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| working with a whole host of people to work through really complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| and lengthy processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| We've been working on this site for probably over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| and I truly don't think that this property would be able to be developed unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| we got involved to really help facilitate cleaning this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| So it's great to see that it will be able to be cleaned up as far as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| environmental condition and brought back to life and be able to really utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| the Marion Street improvements and the Greenway connectivity that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| close to one of our corridor streetscape projects on North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| And those are the end of our case studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| So we're happy to chat more or go back through any of the slides and discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| anything else you have questions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Yeah, so I don't know if this is a question for RJ or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| but when I look at the slide packet, number nine, the current redevelopment areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| there are some redevelopment areas that are not on here, like Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| Lonsdale, Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Are those just not current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Is there a reason why they're not on this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| I think the primary reason, and we can add those back, but there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| Some of those are neighborhood plans that are, in fact, on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| but were not approved by council, so they're a little bit different legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| The other thing is I think at the onset of this tool we were looking at urban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| areas, and you're making a good point that it might be appropriate to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| those neighborhood plans and get them added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| So I think there was a distinction between the downtown core and things like TIFF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| because this tool is really used for developers to help them guide their decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| about where to invest and where to look at sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| But neighborhoods have a lot of opportunities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Okay, but so Five Points is different than those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Five Points is an example of one that was approved by council and should be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| Okay, but the others weren't approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| There's different circumstances in each case, but, yes, some of those were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| They're more neighborhood plans that were still thoughtful and engaging with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| but they don't carry the same legal heft of a redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| that's been approved by you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And some of the intent on those neighborhood plans were to really study how the infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| housing guidelines were appropriate in some of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| So if you look at some of those neighborhood plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| they were established and incorporate a lot of the language in the infill housing guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| to show how that is appropriate and how those guidelines can help guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| appropriately scaled development in these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| mostly single family and low-density residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| And actually, now that I'm looking, the green one in the upper right is the Five Points redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| The green in the upper right is Five Points, but you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| The neighborhood plans aren't listed on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| A lot of the tools for incentives, especially tax abatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| are most appropriate with larger scale projects, not more single family or low-density projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3349)|
| 0:56:02| We have other tools that are most appropriate for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Slightly different shift in a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| There's some past conversations and future conversations about the Broadway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3375)|
| 0:56:21| and redevelopment along there, where we also have conversations about Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| Is it appropriate for areas like that to be designated redevelopment areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Like what are the benefits? What are the drawbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| It's a broad stroke question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| So I think that there are benefits, but usually what we would see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| and this is a good case in point along Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| so the Jeffrey Nash project to revitalize the three or four apartment buildings right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| that is indicative of growth heading that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| and the need to put a redevelopment plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| We typically would not, without any private sector interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| put a whole redevelopment plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| What would most likely happen is someone would come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| and they'd say the shopping center at the corner of Chapman and Moody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| and I'm thinking that's outside the South Waterfront District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| We have a project in mind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| We would potentially do a project-based redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| Tax increment finance is eligible on the project level as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| Similar to what we did at the St. Mary's site, but the project-based?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Precisely, and then we would use that data point as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| hmm, we probably need to explore the larger area further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| and then it's very likely that that could lead to a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| along Broadway or along Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| That conversation made me think of a project that came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| for housing at Knoxville College that I heard wasn't going to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| but it made me think about what can we do as a city potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| to help with redevelopment in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Has KC been considered for a project-based redevelopment area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3503)|
| 0:58:33| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Yeah, I mean, that is a wonderful site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| and it would be great to see it brought back to life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| but we haven't explored that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| I just, I think the last project fell through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| because of lack of access to financing options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| Okay, just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Wanted to follow up on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Because Knoxville College is a privately owned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| would that have to be driven by their board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| in order for us to be able to consider it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| to be added as a redevelopment area rather than the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| I mean, any time, any property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| we would certainly want that interest and ambition to come from either the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| or the board of directors associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| I mean, there are times, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| that's a special scenario where there are challenges of vandalism and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| but certainly with any, we would want willing partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| I have a question around just the volume of requests that you have for incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| How many did we receive last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| I would say there were probably around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| I don't have that off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| but there were probably around 20 or 25 in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| This year we've seen about, probably about half of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| but we've also received a lot of inquiries for things like hotels downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| that we are not that focused on continuing the conversation for incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| We feel like the market can carry a branded or flagged hotel on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| Also student housing, we feel like it's carrying its weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| So we're focused on conversations that are for housing most specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3646)|
| 1:00:58| And R.J. and I, just to be clear, mainly her a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| we take hundreds of calls that are sort of initial requests in a given year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| from all kinds of parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| but then those get whittled down for various reasons to people that have site control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| and have a somewhat viable project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| and then it whittles down further to who actually submits an Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| the first part of the process, and I think that's probably about 20-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| Just to go into depth a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| this mapping tool has been so helpful and so useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| because five years ago we didn't have key development priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| we didn't have a map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| so people who called that maybe had an option on a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| or were considering investing in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| we had no real way to show them what was most attractive to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| to partner on an incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| So these conversations are happening more frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| but also we have better resources and better tools to communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| and I feel like even if they don't proceed with a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| they're learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| and we even have people that we've been introduced to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| that are starting to ask more frequently about what's going on in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| and what types of infrastructure plans do you have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| and how is the Greenway system growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| and they're really attracted to all of that public space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| and infrastructure plans that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| and some of those big pieces of civic furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| like the pedestrian bridge, parks, the stadium, the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| So they're calling because they're hearing things about that in the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| and then we're able to have these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| So we are able to, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| market the tools we have available to people on various scales of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| as Knoxville is becoming more on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| And the whittling is not necessarily just due to sheer size, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| It's my understanding a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| we refined some of the application fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| so that they can scale down to smaller developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Is that still the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| We mentioned a couple of specific things about redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| and I'm going to mention those again as a groundwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| for asking a more general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| You mentioned Jeffrey Nash who had spurred some development on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| and that because he took the initiative and made some investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| then that got the city's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| and we can partner with that and kind of build around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| Then we talked about Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| where it's a place that needs some help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| unless the board of directors approach us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| then there's not much we can do, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| But talking more generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| so if you see blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| if there's blighted property in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| and the city kind of looks at it and thinks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| that would be a great place for development of some kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| It's blighted, nothing's happening there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| but the owner's not taking any initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| It's just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| How do we start strategizing and developing tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| to spur the owner or to reach out to the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| or to get some kind of traction going on these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| that we can identify as being underused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| but the owner is not taking any initiative at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| So I think that's a challenge we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| and I just wondered if we're working on strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| or how we would kind of spark movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| on these blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Well, one strategy that we've used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| that has proven to be pretty effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| is we utilize the energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| of our commercial real estate agent community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| and we have been participating in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| we've been invited by certain groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| to come and talk to the folks in their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| We've been invited to the Commercial Real Estate Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| I might be getting that group wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| but it's all the commercial real estate folks in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| to talk about incentives, to talk about special projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| So we're marketing these tools and these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| to people that we know are then marketing them outwardly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| and they can go and share the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and be pushy in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| that maybe the city is not in a position to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| We're offering the Olive Branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| and our teammates and stakeholders in the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| that have different roles in making those transactions happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| are the ones bringing people to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Let's just say that's one way we're partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| with other people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| to really try and activate some of those sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| that have higher and better uses for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| Yeah, that's right, and some kind of outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| or maybe certain property owners don't even know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| because they're comfortable sitting on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| they might not know that the city actually has some tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| to help them develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| So just more outreach, a little more proactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| and more communication to kind of bring those folks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| to where we can make partners out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Just a comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| As the urban tree master plan continues to progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| I'm a part of the implementation team for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| so I don't think there's a specific connection yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| to our current incentive development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| but as that progresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| I would just encourage the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| to look at incentives that can be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| for developments or small groups, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| whatever it is, incentives to outpace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| whatever the tree canopy requirement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| So it's not necessarily called out as a specific priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| but I think it should be in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| particularly as that implementation plan develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| So I would ask that you look out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| And then one question, Director Rosenberg or Deputy Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| would you come forward just to put you on the spot for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| A couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| Do any of our plans permitting review process change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| for these developments that receive any type of incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| or standard protocol just like every other development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| I mean, we try to treat all of our customers equitably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| and make sure we process all of our permits in an expedited manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| but myself and Peter, Brian Berry, others on our team participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| work very closely with RJ and her team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| particularly on projects that have, our engineering team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| projects that have development agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| and public infrastructure that's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| But to answer your question, I mean, we're coordinated in that effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| and we obviously give, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| these projects are typically more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| They require a little more extra review and extra time as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4111)|
| 1:08:39| so they end up getting more attention from our staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| I know you recently updated the turnaround times for permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| These fall within those new SLAs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| These new turnaround times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Yeah, so we set up a tiered system for reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| and again, typically 20 million plus is kind of in that tier four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| so it's the highest review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| But, you know, we set goals for each of our tiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| I just got some data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I brought it with me, but we got our data for May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| and I'm really excited to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| We've actually exceeded all of our benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| for plans review turnaround for the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Is that a first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| That's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| We hit three of the four, I think, last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Last workshop we presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Now we're hitting all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| And not say hitting, we're exceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| So even residential reviews, you know, we started in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| We're at 23 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| We're at six days in May, and that's over half of our permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| and our permits are up 16% over April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| So volume went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Our review times actually went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| So, again, trending in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| So you haven't seen, you know, financing challenges cause a delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| a turndown in applications for permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| We're still seeing increased permits, housing, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| most of it residential, which is great news, single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| So, yeah, we're really proud of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| We're going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| That's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| That's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| But just to be clear, these developments that receive incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| don't have separate SLAs or turnaround times unique to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| They fall within whatever the value of the property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| along with the other developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| and you try to move them along as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| just like everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Yeah, generally they go through the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| Again, these are typically more complicated projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| because they require development incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| They're typically more complicated in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| They're larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| So they get a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| They get a little more attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| but they require a lot more time and attention as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Yeah, I mean, again, there's no special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| We are working on some expedited review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| but that would be available to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| whether they pursue our public-private partnership or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4252)|

| 1:10:54| I was just going to say, following up on what you said about turnaround times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4254)|
| 1:11:05| but things are up, I would just like it duly noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| that the investments the city council made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| in adding additional resources to your departments must be paying off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| Yes, and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I failed to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| No, I just mean it's really good to hear that when you asked for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| we gave it, and what we all hoped would happen is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| Well, and quite frankly, what I'm so excited about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| we weren't anticipating meeting those benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| until probably later in the summer or early fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| so we're meeting them earlier than we thought we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| because we just started hiring these folks the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| so the increase in staffing is absolutely making a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| but also being more focused and having benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| and objectives and goals that we can work towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| and just how we've organized our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Again, we have this tiered review system now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| where everything used to all go in one line, one queue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| so you'd have a small residential project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| in the same line as the hub development on Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| and we, again, took a different approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| breaking it up, better management plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| And I'll just say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| really good morale in our plans review inspections department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| and just feel good about the team we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| and the work they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| All I wanted to say is congratulations to you and the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| It's not one lever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| It's many levers that have been pulled to make this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| It's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| They should be congratulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| You are to be congratulated and maybe celebrate a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| because that's a big win in a short turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| and it's to be commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| I've been cautious on taking a victory lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| In the private sector, they'd take you out to dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| but we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| Not the whole team, up to $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Sizzling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Any other questions, council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| If not, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| This has been a good update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you for the bonus update, Director Rosenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| and really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Oh, I do actually have one question at the risk of faking everybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Director DeBose is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| but I know he has started the process of evaluating NOAAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| Any idea what incentives for those might look like around the corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| I don't want to steal Director DeBose's thunder, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| Do you have any thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Well, he missed class, so somebody's going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| He did miss class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Certainly there are many tools that we already have in place that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| support NOAAs being incentivized to focus on that older housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| and getting them up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| but also keeping the rents at realistic rates for different incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| So we already have the tools in place that can make those projects happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| It's just the fine balance of doing the numbers on how do we subsidize rents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| do we subsidize land acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| So it's all the fine-tuned details of putting together a deal that works numerically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| But in context, we have tools in place that can allow NOAA to be incentivized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| So you feel like the existing tool set is adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| All right, no more teasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Any other objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| I'll ask one final one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Quick, quick, quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Any update on â€‘â€‘ I just wanted to encourage the moving forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| compiling sample designs that can be used for some of the new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| that are going in because both I think that we're seeing a lot of design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| that the communities are not liking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| So if we can find good designs to offer to developers who are looking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| develop duplexes and quadplexes and increase density in the city, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| And I know the city's strategy is to compile from existing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| But keep in mind, a lot of the projects coming in are not super appealing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| So if we can get good designs that actually do match our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| neighborhoods and offer them to developers, I think that really would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| help our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| I think it's a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Once, twice, that's sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| That's it for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240620?start=4556)|
