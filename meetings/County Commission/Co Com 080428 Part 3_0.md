| 0:00:00| And I would want to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=0)|
| 0:00:02| Yeah, I mean, the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=2)|
| 0:00:05| Yeah, I mean, we own the motion to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| Well, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=9)|
| 0:00:10| Yeah, this is how we own the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=10)|
| 0:00:15| And so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=15)|
| 0:00:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=16)|
| 0:00:18| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=18)|
| 0:00:20| I mean, he knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| talking to approve this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=22)|
| 0:00:26| No. OK, I didn't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| I think you should do them all by roll call, roll call vote, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| because we're voting on one or three to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| On the second reading, the first one was called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=36)|
| 0:00:40| Mr. Chairman, if you if you could do by roll call and explain the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| before you take it, because some of these you vote, yes, you're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| No. Some of them, you know, you're voting. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| So if you vote, yes, you vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| But you vote no, you vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| Tell me if that one was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| This is to approve with the amendments from the charter petition group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| Correct. That's correct. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| Two thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Roll call would be the best method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| That way you'll have roll call start in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=74)|

| 0:01:53| No. Commissioner Pinkston. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| Mr. Pan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| I'd like to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| It's two thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Would mine matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| I wasn't doing the count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Do you want to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| No, I don't want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| He doesn't want to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| I'll strip off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| It is a move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| I think it's two thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| If he votes yes it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| But the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| Twelve ayes, six noes and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| 104. I mean, 106.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| This is an ordinance amending Article nine of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| Charter to establish an independent office of inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Knox County Charter is adopted November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| November 8th, 1988 as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| The referendums of November 8th, 1994 and August 6th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| In the governmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Voted 8-0. No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| Finance. Finance 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| And if I get a second, I got a question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Was the wording changed, Madam Law Director, substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| that we would need to make it first reading or is the language such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| that it could be done on second reading tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| I think in this situation, this could be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| Law director, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| pretty sure if this passes, you have to write the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| Capture for the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Now, physical note will be on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| It has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Very. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Law director, does this call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| call for abolishing the internal auditor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| It does abolish the Office of Internal Audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| and it establishes an independent office of inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| Question, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| So kind of in conjunction with your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| if this was to pass with the fiscal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| be the difference between what we're paying now for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Mr. Walls and what we would be paying for this independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| this inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| John says there's not a requirement for a fiscal note here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| Did you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Mr. McKenzie, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Did you ask if there would be a difference in the pay or what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Well, well, that that that was my basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| Chairman Strickland asked, was there going to be a fiscal note of tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| And I thought the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| And I said, well, if that answer is yes, would it be the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| between what the inspector general office would cost and what we're paying now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Be quite a bit different, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| The internal audit office altogether makes one hundred and fifty six thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| That's every employee there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I believe this calls for the inspector general to start out with one hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| and forty four thousand plus all his help in his office space that he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| So you're probably going to be talking about over one hundred and fifty six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=328)|
| 0:05:28| You're probably going to be talking up to three or four hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Quite a bit of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| But according to a lot of record, that will that line would not go into this ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| I won't be voting against this because of the I think a large physical note on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| We know that people in government ought to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| And we have procedures in place to make sure people do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| So I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| We've voted on the call for the question, everybody understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| I had a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Sorry, I didn't recognize you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| So we're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| We're going to have a roll call vote starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Mr. DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=377)|

| 0:10:45| or no employee of the Knox County Board of Education may serve as a member of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=645)|

| 0:15:49| We've had a few special meetings up here over an issue I brought to your attention as well as I show up on public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| form a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Something interesting come about during my investigation and I'm still working on in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| Commissioner Roundtree asked a question during our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| He asked how this material was different than the bag material they sell at Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Turns out Knox County had had this material tested right before our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| They got the results back the day of the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| Knox County's own test reflected extremely high levels of fecal coliform in the mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Knox County's own test reflected high levels of E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| coli in the mulch that was being sold by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| I spoke with TDEC about these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| TDEC assured me that corrective actions had taken place, that this material was not now being sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=997)|
| 0:16:44| that they had since replaced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| And I'm saying it's about time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| What concerns me is with as much attention as Knox County has given to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| when our solid waste department tested this material and found out that what I've been telling you is the truth about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| these high fecal coliform levels in this material, they never bothered to inform county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| And they also never bothered to inform the unsuspecting public who had purchased this right before Easter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| which is the busy time of the mulch season when people spruce up their yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| and hide little Easter eggs full of candy for their children to find in their flower beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| This material had an E. coli count of 630,000 MPN per gram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| That is extremely high according to the TDEC officials I spoke with who are qualified to know about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1052)|
| 0:17:41| It had a fecal coliform count of one million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| They had multiple products testing high in the hundreds of thousands in the fecal coliform counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| I'm very concerned that the solid waste department didn't inform you about these tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| and allowed me to stand up here and tell you about these and appear as if I wasn't telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| I don't think that they were fully disclosing to you what they had in their arsenal when you consider they had it tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| with their own test results and this is their test results I'm telling you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| Something else that I was just recently made aware of that I stumbled across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| the contractors made multiple statements about how when he arrived at this site there was not a stick of inventory there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| that it was completely clean, that there was nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| I found an invoice where this contractor billed Knox County to grind existing logs and brush for $25,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1110)|
| 0:18:40| If this facility was completely clean and there was not any inventory on it whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| then how did these existing logs and brush come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| I've asked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| I've been given a few answers about it being related to land clearing or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| I called the contractors involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| That story didn't hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| That has since been added into our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| But I'm very concerned over these lab results that your solid waste department has known about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| and they didn't share with you and they knew I was telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| What company was that that billed this county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| It was Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| They hired a subcontractor by the name of Matthew Grinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| Matthew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Matthew Grinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I have a copy of that invoice as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| I gave those invoices and forwarded those to Star Matthews with the county commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| She has copies of these invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| How did you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| And I was told by TDEC that they voluntarily took corrective action on this material that was being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| I was told by the TDEC officials that if they had not, they were going to force them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| So what I've been telling you about this mulch is the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Your solid waste director knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| These tests were reported back to him the day of the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| These tests were ordered three days before the workshop so that they could tell you how clean this material was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and it looks like it backfired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| It wasn't as clean as they thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I've had a few more issues come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| I went back into the state records to try and determine how much mulch they had sold in 2003, 2004, and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1215)|
| 0:20:23| I was informed by the state of Tennessee that someone had either misplaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| or stolen those records from the state's file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Somebody had went to the state file, checked out the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| All those are missing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| They have been resubmitted by Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| It's something that concerned me is I'm finding these statements in there from him where he personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| I forget the wording, managed or looked over the testing of this material and signed off for years 2004 and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| He didn't work for Knox County in 2004 and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| How did he personally witness this material was meeting the EPA standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| I can't find any record given to me by Knox County for 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| I requested it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| The solid waste department couldn't produce it because I have evidence to the contrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| that the material wasn't clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Yet, when I went to TDEC, they readily produced it and said that he had produced this for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| Mr. Mays, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| I just also found another item where in 2007 they stated in their annual report that all the materials they produced were class B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1284)|
| 0:21:36| biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| I spoke with the TDEC regulators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Class B biosolids are restricted to public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| This is by their own statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| They said that they produced 30-some-odd thousand cubic yards of class B material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| and zero cubic yards of class A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| And if you contact the EPA or TDEC, they'll tell you that that is restricted to public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| That goes exactly with the lab reports that I've been warning the county government about for quite a time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| And it goes with the lab results that are substantiated that Knox County had ran that they had in their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| and they didn't tell you about last county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| And I have a copy of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| I provided those to Star Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I think that I would like to invite Commissioner Moore if he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| I'll have to check with my attorney, but if it's okay with him, I'd like to have you at our next deposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| because we're going to start deposing people pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I think it's going to be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Is there anything else to come before this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Is the law director still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Where's he gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| You know, the only thing, if these counts are real high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| I think we ought to ask the law director to look into it with solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| and if they need to suspend selling to the public, that's what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I understand this material has already been pulled from the retail market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| The point that I'm making to you all is the unsuspecting public who purchased this material just a week or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| before Easter that took this home, put it in their flower beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| preparing for their grandkids to look for Easter eggs and hot candy in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and dig through it with their hands and put this in their mouth, they were never warned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| And neither were you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| You all and the public would never hear a word about this if it wasn't for me staying on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| And I've told you once and I'll tell you again, I started this as a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| I'm finishing this as a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I have no interest in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I know there's a lot of people here that's been told I'm trying to steal their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Anybody that's told you I'm trying to steal their contract or cost them their contract has lied to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| Just like I'm not Len Mays' son, they lied to you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| So you're saying here today that you will not be involved in any county funded waste facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1423)|
| 0:23:51| Never have been, never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| I've never been involved with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| I've done business with several mulch businesses all over this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| I'm not trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| When I started this, I thought they had three or four years left on their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| I only went over this because of my concerns over the health and safety of this material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| and the fact that Knox County was not collecting their due fair amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| And now I'm finding this invoice for existing brush and existing debris when they've already came up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| and went on the record and said there was nothing existing on the site when they moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| I'm finding a lot of problems here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| And I'm really concerned when records start turning up missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| and the solid waste director can't produce the originals signed by John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| He's only producing records from 04 and 05 signed by him for years he wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Mr. Napoli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Mr. Mays, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| I appreciate all your hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I've actually bought material and grew vegetables in this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| And I'm concerned as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| But, you know, a lot of the information you're talking about, the pathogens and fecal coliform, a lot of that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| and I could be wrong, but when it's, you know, suspect of sunlight and a lot of things, it kills a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| So, you know, I'm not saying that there wasn't contamination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| I'm just saying the effects don't make it sound like, you know, kids were eating poop or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Well, sir, according to my conversations with the folks I've discussed who do know about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| class B materials are restricted to human access sometimes for a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| They don't like to let animals graze on this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| If you put it across your field, they don't like for you to grow crops in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| But also, last year they were selling material that was high in arsenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| I appreciate your hard work, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| The thing that concerns me is they didn't tell you when they found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Actually, I turned my light on before Mr. Mays started speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| I just wanted to sunshine that Thursday morning me and Commissioner Roundtree are going to meet at Powell High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1555)|
| 0:26:04| and we're going to deliver their project graduation checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| We don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| And then we're going to go to Carnes after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| I'm just sunshining that in a legitimate meeting so that I don't get in any trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| But, like Mr. Campen, I appreciate all the work you're doing, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| If there's nothing else, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Mr. Chairman, I just want to congratulate you on a short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part3?start=1585)|
