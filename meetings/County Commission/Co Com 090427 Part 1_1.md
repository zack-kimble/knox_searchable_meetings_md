| 2:28:05| Of future cars, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| You know, in any business, government, what have you, there are places you can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:20| And I think we're at that point where we're all looking at those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| But I don't think that, I think Commissioner McKenzie and a couple of others have kind of alluded to this fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:31| that you can't just do it with a broad axe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| You've got to do it more with a scalpel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| You can't just say, in my opinion, you can't say, well, let's just cut 28 off of this side and 28 off of this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8918)|
| 2:28:44| Maybe it needs to be 10 off of this side and 42 off of another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| We don't know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| But what Commissioner McKenzie brought up a minute ago about we need to set some criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| In order to have a take-home vehicle, you must drive X number of miles a week, a month, whatever is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8936)|
| 2:29:05| And I don't think we're in a position right now to determine exactly what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| The folks that are in these positions are the sheriff and those that are over these departments say, okay, I need employee number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:19| I need him to drive 500 miles a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| So he should have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| And I can document that this is what he's driving or she's driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| But for us to do that, then whoever falls under those categories, that's where they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:35| But just to say we're going to lop them off without some reason, there has to be some reckoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:41| And I think that we have to set some criteria about how many miles or how many trips a week before you can determine who does or doesn't get a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:52| Now, that would not apply when you're talking about the sheriff's department's cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| and the safety of all of us sitting here and those out there all over this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| I'm for having them all out there in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| I want one close to me because every time I turn around, one of my neighbors is calling and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| well, did you hear so-and-so got broke into last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| Well, no, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| But now I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| So the more these cars are out there, the safer I think our public feels in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:25| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| Just to make it clear to Commissioner Brown and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| everyone is talking about taking marked deputy things out of vehicles, driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| We know the crime reduction value of that, and that's not part of this proposal and never has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:40| Well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| The other thing is that we can learn from other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| If you look at the commission form, I've posted what other places have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| We don't have to rely exclusively on those who have the benefit of this perk to tell us how much they can take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| We know that other counties, for example, have set a standard of if you don't drive 8,000 miles a year on county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| you don't qualify for a take-home vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| We can learn from others and impose that standard, and I hope that Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9062)|
| 2:31:06| and his good work on developing standards will come up with something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:12| And listen very closely to what we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| We've heard there's a dramatic cut coming, and then in the fine print it's going to be, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| future cars that we're not going to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:21| I think I should be commended for bringing together the historic rift between the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| and the mayor's department because they have allied themselves to save their perks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| These are the perks that are being saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| Twenty-eight vehicles each is not too much to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| And I think that it's time that we – there they are together again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:43| We're just getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| And all we have to do is say we're over budget on take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| We are way in excess of other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| And asking what amounts to less than a 20% overall take-home vehicle fleet cut is a reasonable thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:58| And if you have great plans forthcoming, you wouldn't object to a standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:03| that is actually probably lower than what a great plan should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| I'm going to give the mayor – I was getting ready to call on you anyway, Mayor Axtell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| but I'll let you go ahead and speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| And in your response, if you could also address, because I'd like to hear your take on this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9136)|
| 2:32:25| the fact that you're going to be giving your budget tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| Because in my thinking, if we were hearing this back in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| and this is no fault on Commissioner Mark Carman because he's been working diligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| and I appreciate the work he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| But if we were hearing this back maybe in January that you could have taken this into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| into your budget tomorrow, then I think that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| But when we're on the eve of hearing your budget presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| and I think that if we – as we go through your budget that you propose to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| we can take into account what Commissioner Harmon is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| Then I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| But if you could respond to the question as to whether or not you think we need to proceed on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9184)|
| 2:33:12| and your thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| Well, first of all, I wasn't planning on addressing it until Commissioner Harmon spoke something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| that just completely wasn't the truth, and I think you need to consider that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| I have never had a riff with this sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| Don't plan on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| We get along just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| We work together, I think, hand-in-hand on a wide variety of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| The reason for you to allude otherwise is you're making a statement that's quite candidly and, in fact, untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| With that being said, when most of you come to visit with me about a proposal, you lay it out in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| You share with me, this is what I want to do, this is why I think it's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| this is why I think it could help Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| In your particular case, you refused to do that or didn't do it, whatever the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| The other 18, I think, have always done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| And with that being said, I want to applaud you for doing that and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| We can accomplish a great deal, and I've said this over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9239)|
| 2:34:02| when we work together and we communicate with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| If we stand off and just take off on our own, then we don't get very much accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| I think you're going to see a budget tomorrow that has some reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| that's going to serve our citizens very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| We actually print the budget, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| We don't have a word processor where we can change it point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| I guess that's another error that you alluded to that's not candidly the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| I wasn't going to bring that one up, but the fact of the matter is the budget's printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| So, with that being said, I would hope that we could get into the budget and work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9268)|
| 2:34:32| I appreciate Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| I appreciate General Nichols, and I appreciate all the other elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| who have worked with us diligently in trying to get through this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| We are in a recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| We have fewer government workers now than we had in 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| yet we're serving more citizens because we've worked well at it together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| and we've helped grow our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| Not creating government jobs, Commissioner, like the two you have, but creating private sector jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9294)|
| 2:35:00| and we're going to continue to do that as long as I'm in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| So, I appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| What a personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| My job is paid for by the tuition of my good student's parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| I appreciate what you go through the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| just like your salary is paid for here by the citizens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| Yours is too, so let's get to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| The fact of the matter is I'm sorry that it's not going to suit you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| The vote may please you greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| I don't ask how you're going to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| But the fact of the matter is we've got a budget coming up tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| We're going to present something that's professional, that's going to serve our citizens well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| and I look forward to giving it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| and I look forward to you amending it in a proper way that will serve your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| and my constituents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Mayor, maybe I missed it, but your thoughts on whether or not you feel we should proceed on with this resolution today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:49| Well, I think you summed it up perfectly, Mr. Vice Chairman, in your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9349)|
| 2:35:52| when you alluded to the fact that you're getting the budget tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| Let's see what's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| A few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9361)|
| 2:36:02| Sheriff, and this is just out of me not knowing, when you request vehicles in a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| do you specify what kind of vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| If we want 20 ground vehicles, do you specify those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9369)|
| 2:36:13| No, we specify a total number of vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| and then we decide if we need those to be marked or unmarked vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| You know, I have, during the finance meeting, for those of you that don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| this proposal failed miserably the first time because the names were in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| And I voted against it because it, you know, violated the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9389)|
| 2:36:36| And there's another proposal in the law director's office that's being reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| that may eliminate some of our drive-home cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| And I appreciate the fact that we've got two people working on the same project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| but why do we debate them separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| Why don't we bring both proposals together at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| Because Mr. Hammond's may have things in it that we like and don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| and this one has things in it we like and we don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| But when we put names in it, we politicized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| And you can say whatever you want to about micromanagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| We're not micromanaging it now because the names are in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| Well, the recommendation of the intergovernmental is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:17| There was no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| So the names are still there on one side of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9440)|
| 2:37:24| So I think I agree with Commissioner Lambert that we need to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| number one, to see what the budget's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| and number two, to see what Mr. Hammond's proposal is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| We've made cars political and we're throwing numbers around like we're going to save $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:43| those cars are going to bring less than $2,000 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| I've been in government fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| I know what they bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| I know what a 1999 versus a 2008 is going to bring, that it's been driven 200,000 miles, 100,000 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| They're not worth anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| So I think that we really need to look at the perspective of what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:05| With the names in it, it's political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9485)|
| 2:38:08| With the names out of it, it's still political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| because nothing changed except for the names, and the names were removed to protect the innocent, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9490)|
| 2:38:15| But we need to make sure that we're doing this for the right reasons and not for political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9502)|
| 2:38:27| My original proposal was to postpone this for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| but seeing what a circus this has become, I don't want to repeat this in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:37| I think we have a budget that's coming out tomorrow that will address some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| Mr. Hammond has some proposals that are being reviewed by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| that some of this proposal may be added as an amendment to Mr. Hammond's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:59| I hope I don't regret doing this, but I'm going to withdraw my substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| and I hope that we vote this down today because this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| Does the second agree with the withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9554)|
| 2:39:15| I'll leave my 30-day deferral standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| Well, you never know what's going to happen between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9560)|
| 2:39:21| Commissioner Pinkston, you had stated that you were recusing yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| Did you still want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:26| I want to ask the sheriff a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:29| First of all, sheriff, you correct me if I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| You said you have added no new people driving cars since you've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9572)|
| 2:39:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9578)|
| 2:39:39| The other thing now, I believe you said with the merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| that you would have to reimburse these people either in salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| and furnish them mileage for driving their own car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| To the best of my knowledge at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| $3,600 seems to be the number for a year that they would have to be reimbursed for the vehicle plus mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| Therefore, if we did take these cars, we're not going to save any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| We're not going to save any money and may end up costing us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| So what we need to do, in my opinion, you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:13| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| Commissioner Pinkston recused himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| I still have the right to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| He's about to give an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| I have already asked the law director if he has a right to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| What I'm trying to say, Sheriff, someone should get with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| and we should set up a criteria to who can, what people have to qualify for to drive a car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9638)|
| 2:40:45| and then let attrition take care of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| When people leave, if they leave, then whoever fills their slot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| if they don't reach the requirements, they don't get a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| I can't say it any plainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| Any person that you take a vehicle away from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| you will have to recompensate them in dollars and cents for the vehicle you've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| plus paid mileage for any official duties they drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| It's just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| But if we reach a criteria of what the qualifications are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| whoever replaces these people will not get a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| Down the road, I would certainly be agreeable with anything that you reach on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9681)|
| 2:41:29| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9691)|
| 2:41:32| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| You're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:41| I just wanted to clarify something that took place in the Intergovernmental Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| Brad, you weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| But the reason that we passed it with no recommendation was because we didn't even take any time to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| because we were taking so long in our meeting discussing other things that we decided just to save time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9712)|
| 2:42:00| And because we knew we were going to have a big discussion about it today, we just passed it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:05| It wasn't even discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| So it wasn't that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| I watched it on TV, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| But it doesn't change the fact that the names are still in it if you pass it with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| But I wanted to make sure that everybody understood that the reason it was passed with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| was because we didn't want to take the time to discuss it that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:27| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| I do not have a problem deferring this for 30 days so we can see what the budget is going to look like tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| I don't have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| I do want to make clear, though, that the policy that I'm looking at is a policy that the law director is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| The current policy we have, plus any improvements that may be able to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| I know that he'll be passing it around to the different people for their review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| so that when we come in next month we will have a policy that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| But it does not address numbers of vehicles, costs, any of that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| It is a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| But I think it's a good policy, and will be a good policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| that will strictly define who gets to take a car home and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| We have seen here today that this is going to be a volatile issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| I'm prepared for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| And we must reduce the number of take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| And I'm prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:18| I'm prepared to vote for it when the budget comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| But I am willing to listen to what the budget has in it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| And I agree with you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| I think not just vehicles, but I think all parts of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| We need to take a look at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| Everything needs to be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| And like I said, I commend the work that Commissioner Mark Harmon has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| and I'm going to be taking that into consideration when I vote on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| and as we go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| So with that said, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| One, just to be clear where I'm standing on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9834)|
| 2:44:00| I'm not in favor of Commissioner Harmon's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| What I'm in favor of is policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| So let me say that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| But I think, you know, and I'm not saying, well, just let me say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:19| In terms of recusing yourself, and I don't know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| and I'd ask the law director to continue to research that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| and maybe give something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| But when you do that, I think it means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| I think you should exempt yourself from the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| To give a personal opinion when you have a personal interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| that led you to recuse yourself is wrong publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9880)|
| 2:44:47| We do this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:48| People recuse themselves a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| When you do that, you say, I'm stepping back from the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| I'm too close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9895)|
| 2:44:56| And even if it's not the law, I think personal responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| and I'm not directing it personally at Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| is generally speaking for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| When we're too close to an issue, we don't need to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| So I want to make sure, while I agree with everything that you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| well, not everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| There's one I'm going to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| But your general thinking, I do agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9918)|
| 2:45:23| I think when we recuse ourselves, we really need to back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| Mr. Holt, question on the sheriff said something I think is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:38| And it may not be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| I'm sorry to call you down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| But the compensation piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| if this body passes a policy which required ten vehicles from the mayor's staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9946)|
| 2:45:56| that they're no longer eligible for, do they have to be compensated for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| That is a question for John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| I figured it was financial, but I didn't know who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| You know, and similar with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| If we pass the policy that, okay, now the sheriff loses five based on this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9970)|
| 2:46:17| then do we have to compensate those five employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:24| You want to get back with me on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| I can tell you absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| I can tell you absolutely, yes, under the merit board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9992)|
| 2:46:33| So the merit board policy, and I do not claim to be an expert, know very little about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| So with that said, so once that package is offered, you've got to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:45| an admin person, I'm just picking one, and part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10005)|
| 2:46:50| in their contract it says that you will be supplied a government vehicle, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| It does not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10015)|
| 2:46:56| So what happens to get that being compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| Once it was added in, once they were given the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| And that's why I said about these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| these people have driven some of the ones that were named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| and the other individuals have driven these vehicles for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:13| And I understand that you haven't added in, really, in additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10033)|
| 2:47:17| This is all historical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10037)|
| 2:47:20| But I guess I do question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| And if by rule now, if we have a resolution that we pass that says now John Doe is no longer eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10042)|
| 2:47:31| for a government vehicle, we really need to look into that not being compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:38| So I'll just throw that out there to HR or John or someone to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10058)|
| 2:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| Commissioner Mark Harmon, if you promise to keep it short for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| I'll keep it very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| I have looked up the claim about the merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| and I find IRS Publication 15B that says that police and fire employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| with take-home vehicles are exempt from fringe benefit increased compensation rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10078)|
| 2:48:03| So the argument that it's increased compensation is in direct contradiction with IRS Publication 15B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:09| and thus the merit system argument is false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10089)|
| 2:48:13| You discussed that with the executive director of the merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10093)|
| 2:48:18| He can be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10098)|
| 2:48:19| It was created by a legislative act in 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| Who cannot modify IRS Publication 15B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10104)|
| 2:48:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| We're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| JJ, with what the mayor, evidently you and the mayor have talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| I do not know what the mayor has lined up for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| But in your opinion, you would rather see us postpone this for 30 days and see what comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:43| Here's the bottom line, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| The proposal you have before you will save you nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:50| What you will see tomorrow will save you hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10130)|
| 2:48:55| And we'll trust you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| Be there in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| Be there, be square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| Well, I'm about to say no lights, but go ahead, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10144)|
| 2:49:08| I did have a couple of questions, JJ, just in terms of vehicle usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| And this probably would go to policy or standards of vehicle use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10153)|
| 2:49:20| For the Sheriff's Department, are you fairly formulaic about how, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10160)|
| 2:49:26| Do you use a formula to decide when a vehicle is done, you know, it's on a replacement schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10166)|
| 2:49:34| We do, and especially for vehicles that are driven on patrol, emergency vehicles, patrolling detectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10174)|
| 2:49:40| Now, we do have several vehicles, as Brad said, that are 1999 Luminas with 200,000 miles on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10180)|
| 2:49:47| maybe an IT person who drives back and forth from the city county building three times a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10187)|
| 2:49:52| to make sure that our systems and our servers are in place would be driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| But if it's an emergency vehicle, something that we have to depend on, yes, we have a turnover policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10196)|
| 2:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| How does the ñ and there's been references by Commissioner Harmon, I think, to other departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10204)|
| 2:50:11| sheriff's departments and counties and so on in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| In terms of your all's vehicle use, you know, how many vehicles you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| how do you all compare in terms of other municipalities similar to ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| The closest relationship that I can give you would be the city of Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| They have ten more take-home cars than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| We have twice the employees and we cover five times the square mile area in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10233)|
| 2:50:40| So they have ten more take-home cars than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| So I think that puts us pretty much right in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| But what about ñ have you compared any to, say, a county like Hamilton County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10246)|
| 2:50:52| There's no ñ you don't have any numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10256)|
| 2:50:57| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| I really do understand Commissioner Mark Harmon's intent, and it is a volatile issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10258)|
| 2:51:05| and it's something that, of course, we're trying to respond to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:13| and ensure that ñ them that we're listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| and we're trying to do things that are responsible from a financial standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| And I think he should be commended for the work that he's done because he has done quite a bit of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:29| I probably will not vote in favor of what he wants to do right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| but it's not because of ñ for lack of work that he's provided for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10293)|
| 2:51:41| The other ñ what I see also is this is another effort in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| to provide controls and standardization of processes, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:53| We're going to have more of that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| There's going to be another big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| Of course, we'll be talking about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| And that standardization provides transparency and accountability and assures the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| And you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| And I'm sure that you'll be willing to comply when other policies or procedures come into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10327)|
| 2:52:13| that Commissioner Hammond's task force on vehicle use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| I always have and I always will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10340)|
| 2:52:23| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| Sheriff, I'm not going to beat this to death, but I did have one real question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10346)|
| 2:52:30| and I don't want to get into the mayor's budget tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| But in your reduction, you're not reducing our patrol fleet's replacement potentials of next year, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10353)|
| 2:52:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| I mean, you know, there's going to be issues that have to be ñ if you reduce, you have to reduce across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| And surely there will be patrol cars that we would normally need in the fleet rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10368)|
| 2:52:55| That's why I'm here telling you we're trying to do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10375)|
| 2:53:00| We know it's tough times and we know we need to tighten our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| But we want to save you real dollars, real dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| Seeing no other lights on, ma'am, would you like to speak on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10391)|
| 2:53:16| If you'll just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| My name is Patty Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| I live at 3037 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| And first of all, I would like to ask Mark Harmon where he's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10404)|
| 2:53:29| I stood here at this podium last year with John Troyer sitting to my right over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10409)|
| 2:53:37| And I said, can anybody tell me why the Knox County taxpayers need to furnish John Troyer a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10417)|
| 2:53:48| Does he not make enough money to buy his own vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| I mean, why are we furnishing people like that a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| The sheriff's department, that should not even be debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| Listen, this is something you can relate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| Whenever the shooting happened at the church on Kingston Pike and the shooting at Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10447)|
| 2:54:14| did they call Mr. Ragsdale or did they call John Troyer, Mike Arms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10454)|
| 2:54:20| They called the police department and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| And something you need to consider before you make any kind of cuts where the sheriff's department is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10464)|
| 2:54:31| you need to realize what they do and you need to realize their job is to protect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| I mean, if you've ever had a break-in in your home or your business or you've ever been robbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10477)|
| 2:54:43| or anything's ever happened where you need them, that's a no-brainer, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| I mean, you just don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10489)|
| 2:54:54| You're taking away from yourself and from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10494)|
| 2:54:57| And somebody that's forgotten here, Mr. Harmon, is the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10497)|
| 2:55:01| Oh, I'm trying to thank you for your concern about take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:05| And I assure you the KPD officers who responded to the church where I saw my friends bleeding, I care deeply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10505)|
| 2:55:12| And I want you to know that not a single patrol vehicle is what this proposal is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:18| You mentioned John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| Well, the person who does the budgeting for the sheriff's office, also take-home vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:24| So why don't we have some parity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10524)|
| 2:55:26| Why don't we seek places where we can remove take-home vehicles that are used as perks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| and save the money that you and I both know is out there to be saved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| Why don't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| Why don't we just simply forget about cutting anything from the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10536)|
| 2:55:42| Because their job is just, it goes without saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| That's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Let's start with take-home vehicles, and then let's start with saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10548)|
| 2:55:55| And let's just, right across the board, and this doesn't include the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10555)|
| 2:56:01| we're talking department heads, Mr. Ragsdale, department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:11| They should have take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| They should have vehicles to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10573)|
| 2:56:18| All these other people, like I said, when something bad happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10578)|
| 2:56:23| when the police or the sheriff's department is needed, who do you call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10583)|
| 2:56:32| Thank you, and I'm so glad that you are emphasizing the fact that I have excluded patrol vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| Yeah, and still, I would like your answer, Mr. Harmon, on where you've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10597)|
| 2:56:41| because I stood here last year and said that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| I've been holding hearings and putting stuff up on the commission website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| and researching it so we can come up with a good proposal, and I encourage you to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| Oh, boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| I surely do appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| Sir, did you wish to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| Am I out of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| Would you give me the hi sign when I can talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| You can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| I need your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| My name is William Wallace, and not kin to the guy in Scotland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| but I am the one that chased the bear down in West Hills and caught him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| I've got a few things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:27| I am a native of Knoxville and Oak Ridge, and I pay my taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| but I question the people that want to raise them just because they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| I'm proud to be a resident of Knox County, and I think it's one of the best counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| East Tennessee is the best one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| I've been all around the United States, and I like this better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| I'm proud to be an American, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10664)|
| 2:57:46| God bless America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| All of my findings in this little report here are based on the assessors and the trustees' websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| This is available to anyone with a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| Sir, can I interrupt you for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Right now we're discussing the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| Are you here to talk about the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| or are you here to talk about taxes in general and maybe your assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:07| I'm here to talk about not my assessment, no, but just the way the assessments are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10687)|
| 2:58:13| That's why I say I need to be prepped because I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10696)|
| 2:58:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:18| I thought you were here to talk about the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| We will have an opportunity at public forum if you'd like to wait for that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10700)|
| 2:58:26| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| How do I know when that time is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10707)|
| 2:58:30| If you could see Jolie over here to get signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| I'm on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10714)|
| 2:58:35| I called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10715)|
| 2:58:36| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10716)|
| 2:58:37| At that time, we'll call your name, and you'll have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10717)|
| 2:58:43| But right now we have to stick to the subject at hand, which is the take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| And I hate to have to sit you down, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10732)|
| 2:58:53| No, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| I'm 78 years old, so I can sit down for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| Thank you, sir, and I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| Sir, you need to understand that that's at the end of our meeting, which could be 738 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10739)|
| 2:59:06| It's not going to be 334.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| If we're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| I would suggest that we let him speak before zonings or at least maybe after this is done since he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10749)|
| 2:59:19| Sir, if you would like to hang around, we can always bring you up sooner since you've been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10759)|
| 2:59:25| But I'll give you a call when we're ready to do that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| Call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10768)|
| 2:59:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| I have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10771)|
| 2:59:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| Well, let's have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| We were getting ready to vote, but the light's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| Do you want to withdraw your call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10781)|
| 2:59:42| Because we're going to go to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| I'll withdraw if you're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10784)|
| 2:59:45| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10788)|
| 2:59:49| The call has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| And right now we are voting on the substitute motion to defer this item for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10791)|
| 2:59:57| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10801)|
| 3:00:02| Let's have the noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10802)|
| 3:00:07| I'm no as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| We've got Commissioner McKenzie, Mark Harmon, Amy Broyles, Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10808)|
| 3:00:15| And we have one recusal, Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10821)|
| 3:00:22| So, just to be clear, we're going to have both things on next month's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| This item has been deferred until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| And Commissioner Hammonds will be coming before us, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10834)|
| 3:00:35| It's in the law director's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10835)|
| 3:00:36| And so, once he has looked at it and it's been passed to the proper people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| then my hope is to have it on next month, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| Next month we'll have both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10842)|
| 3:00:43| And at that time, if we wish to maybe somehow combine them, we can do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10843)|
| 3:00:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=10851)|

| 3:10:02| It's a very high visibility area, so partly we chose it to deter crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11402)|
| 3:10:07| But our main goal is to bring the community together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| and build relationships through gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| And this is something that everybody is very interested in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| especially with the way the economy is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| So it's a way that we've brought a lot of people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| because our community is such a diverse group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| We've all kind of been on the agree-upon and come together to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| Okay, but it's an ornamental garden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11426)|
| 3:10:29| No, it's a vegetable garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| Vegetable garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11431)|
| 3:10:32| And we're going to have plots as well as ornamental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| and also classes and demonstrations on gardening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| You're going to bring us some vegetables then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:40| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11440)|
| 3:10:41| I like tomatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11441)|
| 3:10:42| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11442)|
| 3:10:43| Now, I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:46| Oh, goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| I see why we're charging these fine folks $200 for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| Why don't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| Let's give it to them and let them bring us some vegetables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11454)|
| 3:10:58| How do you guys feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:00| We're all consensus in our group, so I have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| Commissioner Briggs, is that a violation of the ethics policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| As long as it's not $35 worth of tomatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11467)|
| 3:11:12| Divided by 19 of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11472)|
| 3:11:14| Let them donate some produce to a homeless shelter or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11474)|
| 3:11:20| Is that your intention anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| Well, we are mostly educational and to bring the community together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| and have a common place that we can all come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| It's not necessarily a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11489)|
| 3:11:30| As you know, organizational meetings can be kind of dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| I guess the vegetables would be to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| Each person rents their lot for $5 a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| so they have a personal lot and then sharing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| We have our own lot for demonstrations that we will give the food away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| Beardsley Farm, community farm, we are in connection with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| and we can give the food away to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| And they can then disperse it to the people they can disperse it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| Who gets the $5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| I just don't want to charge them $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11518)|
| 3:12:00| Well, let's let Grant talk about how they arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:03| You know, there may be some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but, Grant, if you could kind of talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| We tried to give it away and we couldn't do that according to county law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11528)|
| 3:12:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11532)|
| 3:12:13| The law wouldn't state it and we made it as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:16| Grant Rosenberg, Office Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11536)|
| 3:12:19| The reason we arrived at $200, we actually hadn't negotiated any price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:22| We just said we would give it to them for whatever it costs us to prepare the lot for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11542)|
| 3:12:28| And what the $200 figure came from was the cost of the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11548)|
| 3:12:33| Yes, I mean, you know, I would hate for the county to lose money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| I think $200 is reasonable and it kind of blanks it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| Quite frankly, we don't have a line item in my budget that covers appraisals for this specific kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11561)|
| 3:12:49| And the same goes for some of our other issues when we take property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11569)|
| 3:12:54| Did someone second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| They agreed to the price on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11576)|
| 3:12:58| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11578)|
| 3:13:00| Thank you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| I think we ought to get some discretionary funds together and give these folks their $200 back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| And I'll see what I've got in my account available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| Commissioner Lambert made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11594)|
| 3:13:16| He withdrew his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11596)|
| 3:13:17| Oh, did you withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11597)|
| 3:13:18| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11598)|
| 3:13:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11600)|
| 3:13:21| So we're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11603)|
| 3:13:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11604)|
| 3:13:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11605)|
| 3:13:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11606)|
| 3:13:27| Thank you and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11607)|
| 3:13:28| We think it's a very affordable price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:30| We'll bring you vegetables anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11610)|
| 3:13:31| That would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11611)|
| 3:13:39| Resolution 906 is approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11619)|
| 3:13:43| with the Magnolia Avenue Methodist Church for property located at 2713 Linden Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11623)|

| 3:14:05| If you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| Harriet Hendricks, 2700 Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11647)|
| 3:14:15| I am a trustee at Magnolia Avenue United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11655)|
| 3:14:20| and we want to thank the county so very much for deeding this property over to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11660)|
| 3:14:30| It adjoins our church property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| and we would like to work in conjunction with the Cold Springs Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11674)|
| 3:14:42| their watch group, to help make this into a park for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11682)|
| 3:14:50| We have seen what has been done in the old Mechanicsville neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:57| and we hope to do something similar for the community with flowers and a gazebo, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:08| We're still in the work process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| but we truly appreciate the opportunity to do this and share it with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11710)|
| 3:15:17| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11717)|

| 3:15:23| Yeah, I'd just like to thank you and the Magnolia Avenue United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:30| and Mr. E.O. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11730)|

| 3:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:52| Okay, we'll go back to, I think, what, 501?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| H10501 is approving a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| to allocate the 2009 Recovery Act Justice Assistant Grant, JAG, program award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11758)|
| 3:16:05| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11765)|
| 3:16:06| Nine-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11766)|
| 3:16:07| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11767)|
| 3:16:08| Eight-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11768)|
| 3:16:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11771)|
| 3:16:12| I'd like to first disclose this is going toward the Family Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11772)|
| 3:16:18| and they would like to reword where it says 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:23| It would be up to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| It doesn't necessarily have to be 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| The county is not trying to make money off of the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| so they're only going to charge their hard cost up to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| I'd like to make that in the form of an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11793)|
| 3:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11796)|
| 3:16:37| Does the maker of the motion want to accept that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11797)|
| 3:16:41| Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11802)|
| 3:16:44| Do you want to accept that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| And we need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| We never do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| Okay, we never got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| And your second agrees with the amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| Commissioner Anders, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11818)|
| 3:17:02| Motion is to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11822)|
| 3:17:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11825)|
| 3:17:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:08| Mark Quick, I do want to defer over to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| He had something he wished to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| I want to apologize to the commission on my previous opinion on the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11833)|
| 3:17:18| order raised by Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| I was referring to Robert's Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11841)|
| 3:17:24| which does permit debate and discussion when someone recuses themselves from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11844)|
| 3:17:31| vote, but under the recent charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| if someone recuses themselves based on personal interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:40| and I assume that that was the reason for the recusal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11860)|
| 3:17:44| the wording says that the person who recuses themselves based on personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11864)|
| 3:17:50| interest cannot participate in further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| So for future reference, for the benefit of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11873)|
| 3:17:57| I wanted to point that out, and I apologize for my error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11877)|
| 3:18:00| Oh, no, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11880)|
| 3:18:01| And, you know, we put you on the spot, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| I want an answer in half a second, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| We just demand perfection instantaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| Just real quick, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| does that in any way hinders or harm the vote we took at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11893)|
| 3:18:20| Do we need to revisit it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11900)|
| 3:18:23| The charter doesn't say anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11903)|
| 3:18:30| In today's climate, I don't think that someone will file a lawsuit over that vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11910)|
| 3:18:37| because apparently it was just deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11917)|
| 3:18:42| But if someone on the prevailing side of that issue wanted to make a motion that it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11922)|
| 3:18:50| reconsidered and voted on again, I think that would cure any deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11930)|
| 3:18:57| He did not vote, but he did participate within the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| To be on the safe side, I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| No, I think you actually voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| I think you on the losing side, you and I both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| Yeah, you voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11950)|
| 3:19:11| I'll make the motion, but with the motion, I'm calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:17| Well, your vote is to reconsider Item 914, I believe that's the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:23| And do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11964)|
| 3:19:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11966)|
| 3:19:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11967)|
| 3:19:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11968)|
| 3:19:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:30| Well, it's just to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| That's what we're voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11973)|
| 3:19:34| Do you still want to vote no on the revisit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11976)|
| 3:19:37| We've got one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11977)|
| 3:19:38| Everybody understand what we just voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| It was just to revisit that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11983)|
| 3:19:44| And we still have Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| You're still recusing yourself with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11988)|
| 3:19:49| Now we're back on to 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11991)|
| 3:19:52| Make a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11995)|
| 3:19:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11996)|
| 3:19:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11997)|
| 3:19:58| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11998)|
| 3:19:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=11999)|
| 3:20:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12000)|
| 3:20:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12001)|
| 3:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12002)|
| 3:20:03| We've got two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12003)|
| 3:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12004)|
| 3:20:05| We had four earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12005)|
| 3:20:06| Well, we had three, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12006)|
| 3:20:07| That's just rubbing it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12007)|
| 3:20:08| If we vote again, it would be down to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12008)|
| 3:20:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12009)|
| 3:20:10| The motion passes with 15, two, and one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12010)|
| 3:20:11| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12011)|
| 3:20:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=12012)|

| 3:44:13| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13453)|
| 3:44:14| Mr. Harmon, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13454)|
| 3:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13456)|
| 3:44:17| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13457)|
| 3:44:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| As we start the debate today, I think the question that we should be asking is how are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13463)|
| 3:44:29| the taxpayers' dollars best protected and how is the public interest best served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13469)|
| 3:44:36| Commissioner Hammond asked at the last meeting what the changes would really mean if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13476)|
| 3:44:41| resolution passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| The proposals are all related to administrative issues that every other department in every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13483)|
| 3:44:48| office of the county government already lives under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| None of the changes infringe on the duties or responsibilities of any officeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13491)|
| 3:44:57| Let's very briefly look at what actually would change if we passed this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13497)|
| 3:45:04| First, dealing with payroll issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13504)|
| 3:45:06| As already pointed out by some people, including some of the officeholders, the fee offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13506)|
| 3:45:11| are already in the process of turning the payroll over to the county system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13511)|
| 3:45:15| This would just formalize the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13515)|
| 3:45:18| The next issue deals with regulating and controlling purchasing cards and travel reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13518)|
| 3:45:24| by the county purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13524)|
| 3:45:27| I reviewed the county's control system since the mayor's office turned regulation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13527)|
| 3:45:31| control of the P cards over to the purchasing department about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13531)|
| 3:45:35| There is a four-person control as well as computer controls that makes inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13535)|
| 3:45:39| use very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| In the past year, there have only been six strikes or warnings sent out regarding questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13541)|
| 3:45:46| on inappropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13546)|
| 3:45:48| Sanctions are available to discourage misuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13548)|
| 3:45:53| The point being is that the county government can run a very effective P card and travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13553)|
| 3:45:59| reimbursement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13559)|
| 3:46:02| The third item deals with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13562)|
| 3:46:05| An argument has been made that submitting a budget somehow infringes on the power, rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13565)|
| 3:46:10| or privileges of the fee offices and would inhibit them from functioning as an independent office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13570)|
| 3:46:16| I'd like to point out that the mayor's office, the sheriff's office, and the board of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13576)|
| 3:46:23| are all elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13583)|
| 3:46:26| All of these undergo budget review and they function very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13586)|
| 3:46:31| The county commission serves as a check and balance of the budgeting process and provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13591)|
| 3:46:35| transparency for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| Historically, the commission has supported all the above entities in serving the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13598)|
| 3:46:44| And if you recall, last year after a 12-hour budget meeting, I think we approved all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13604)|
| 3:46:49| budgets of all the departments except we dropped the part about the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13609)|
| 3:46:55| So there's really not been long, contentious debates and we've not slashed budgets inappropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13615)|
| 3:47:01| The next deal with contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13621)|
| 3:47:04| Presently, the fee offices are not required to use the county purchasing department for RFPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| and the competitive bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13628)|
| 3:47:11| Contracts over $100,000 do not have to come before the county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13631)|
| 3:47:18| Number five is human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13638)|
| 3:47:21| The Rutherford Moss Human Resources Assessment in 2007 pointed out glaring deficiencies in personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13641)|
| 3:47:27| payroll, and human resource management in the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13647)|
| 3:47:31| The recent fraudulent payroll payments by an employee in the trustee's office has cost the county about $185,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13651)|
| 3:47:38| which it is unlikely to recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13658)|
| 3:47:41| The argument has been made by the fee offices that they would no longer be able to hire who they needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13661)|
| 3:47:46| by using the county human resource office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13666)|
| 3:47:49| I recently spent the afternoon with Frances Fogerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13669)|
| 3:47:52| If an opening comes up in a department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13672)|
| 3:47:55| the director submits a request to the HR department listing the education and experience requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13675)|
| 3:48:00| She posts the position and then places all the applicants on a spreadsheet for the director to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13680)|
| 3:48:06| He then interviews and hires who he feels is best qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13686)|
| 3:48:10| All human resources does is to assure that a qualified person is hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13690)|
| 3:48:17| Also, just as in the sheriff's office and the rest of the county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13697)|
| 3:48:20| there is a grievance process for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13700)|
| 3:48:23| In the past, the employment process in the fee offices has not been transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13703)|
| 3:48:28| and there's been numerous allegations of campaigns run out of the offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13708)|
| 3:48:33| and hirings and firings based solely on politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13713)|
| 3:48:37| The bottom line is what would the fee offices be trying to preserve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| I honestly believe we have very good people as office holders that inherited a flawed and archaic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13722)|
| 3:48:49| Both Roderick Vermoss in 2007 and KPMG pointed out during the external audit process in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13729)|
| 3:48:57| that the present system in the fee offices was ripe for fraud and lacked the most basic controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13737)|
| 3:49:03| Also, it would never be tolerated in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13743)|
| 3:49:07| The warnings of these two independent auditors turned to reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| with the payroll and P-card problems in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13750)|
| 3:49:14| I have yet to hear how the present system better serves the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13754)|
| 3:49:18| saves money, or why these administrative functions need to be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13758)|
| 3:49:22| I have heard only threats of lawsuits for reasons that are not clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13762)|
| 3:49:26| other than to preserve some vague privileges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13766)|
| 3:49:30| Some of the arguments against this resolution is that it's illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13770)|
| 3:49:35| and I certainly don't want today to get into another discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13775)|
| 3:49:40| I'll concede and I hope that the law director would concede that there is a difference of opinion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13780)|
| 3:49:45| and that differences of opinion are very common when you have lawyers and different people writing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13785)|
| 3:49:53| I would hope that we could just put these aside for the time being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13793)|
| 3:49:57| and try to judge the resolution on its merit and not on differences of opinion among attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13797)|
| 3:50:04| Another argument is you do not want the fee offices to be controlled by the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13804)|
| 3:50:10| As I've already pointed out, the sheriff, the school board, and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13810)|
| 3:50:14| have their budgets consolidated by the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13814)|
| 3:50:17| Does anyone really believe the mayor's office has control of the schools and the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13817)|
| 3:50:24| Another argument is let the fee offices run their offices without submitting a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13824)|
| 3:50:29| The voters will decide if they approve of what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13829)|
| 3:50:32| If that is the case, then each department in the mayor's office, the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13832)|
| 3:50:37| the board of education should submit a budget, and the county commission should accept it without question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13837)|
| 3:50:43| and simply set the tax rate to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13843)|
| 3:50:46| If the voters do not like higher taxes, they can vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13846)|
| 3:50:50| Another argument is the voters have already voted on the issue and it's settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13850)|
| 3:50:55| Amendment number four during the recent election involved multiple questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| but I believe the critical issue decided last November was simply the citizens' desire to continue to elect the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13858)|
| 3:51:06| I also believe the citizens want all branches of government to work efficiently and to save their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13866)|
| 3:51:13| The citizens and the taxpayers elected us to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13873)|
| 3:51:17| They do not want to review every item in the budget or audit the P cards themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13877)|
| 3:51:22| That's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13882)|
| 3:51:23| They want us to protect their interest and assure that their hard-earned dollars that they send us in taxes are spent wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13883)|
| 3:51:31| I've heard from a lot of angry taxpayers in the past several weeks regarding the reappraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13891)|
| 3:51:36| Not one person told me they wanted to pay more taxes to support the inefficient administration of the independent fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13896)|
| 3:51:44| The question I was asked again and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13904)|
| 3:51:47| is anybody looking out for me down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13907)|
| 3:51:50| And what are you guys doing down there to keep my taxes low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13910)|
| 3:51:53| In conclusion, the vote today is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13913)|
| 3:51:56| Are we going to perpetuate an archaic practice that everyone agrees is flawed and liable to fraud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13916)|
| 3:52:05| I do not look at this proposal as adversarial to the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13925)|
| 3:52:08| but as an offer to relieve them of onerous administrative responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13928)|
| 3:52:14| I also believe that participation in the budget process provides the fee offices with an opportunity to work with the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13934)|
| 3:52:21| and offers them an open forum to gain public confidence by explaining their expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13941)|
| 3:52:28| I'll get back to the question I started with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13948)|
| 3:52:31| How are the taxpayers' dollars best protected and how is the public interest best served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13951)|
| 3:52:37| I believe it is best served by supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13957)|
| 3:52:43| Okay, thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13963)|
| 3:52:45| I don't see any other lights on at this time for discussion, so I'll call on our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13965)|
| 3:52:53| Do we have a light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13973)|
| 3:52:54| Oh, okay, I couldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13974)|
| 3:52:55| Okay, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13975)|
| 3:52:58| Dr. Briggs, does this proposal, does it delete any ordinances that we currently have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13978)|
| 3:53:06| There's an ordinance that we have later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13986)|
| 3:53:09| and presently we have on the books an ordinance that says the fee offices can keep three months of reserve funds to cover their expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=13989)|
| 3:53:20| And since they have a budget, they wouldn't need to have that three-month reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14000)|
| 3:53:26| because they would be drawing out of the county general fund, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14006)|
| 3:53:30| Which ordinance is that we're appealing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14010)|
| 3:53:34| It's 2-478, subsection D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14014)|
| 3:53:42| I bet we don't have a copy of that anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| Is it on our resolution or is it on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14025)|
| 3:53:49| There is an ordinance that's also on the agenda that would repeal that section from the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14029)|
| 3:53:58| I'm sorry, Mr. Law Director, which one was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14038)|
| 3:54:02| The existing provision is section 2-478, subsection lower case D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14042)|
| 3:54:12| Brad, that's item 104, 09-04-104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14052)|
| 3:54:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14057)|
| 3:54:18| Page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14058)|
| 3:54:20| And so these two go hand in hand, one has to happen with the other, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14060)|
| 3:54:24| We don't need the ordinance if this resolution fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14064)|
| 3:54:31| What concerns me about this, and we do have a difference and I'm no lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14071)|
| 3:54:36| and I'm just trying to read everything I can on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14076)|
| 3:54:40| is I'm not against more accountability and open government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| but what I am against is us overstepping our bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| And I believe our law director has told us that without a charter amendment, this is invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14088)|
| 3:54:53| And I'm not comfortable, and I know this is not haphazardly because we've discussed it for two or three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14093)|
| 3:55:02| I'm not comfortable when a law director is advising us it's a violation of the charter, go ahead and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14102)|
| 3:55:10| I feel like we're doing an injustice because we're bringing about, potentially bringing about a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14110)|
| 3:55:18| where we have to hire outside counsel for the commission and for the fee offices if they choose to file a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14118)|
| 3:55:24| I'd just like to make a comment on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14124)|
| 3:55:26| is that I think if we were infringing on the duties of any of these fee offices, that would be a very valid argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14126)|
| 3:55:36| Really, all we're talking about are certain administrative functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14136)|
| 3:55:40| and the ones that I mentioned, we're talking about payroll, we're talking about contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14140)|
| 3:55:44| we're talking about how P cards are handled, travel reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14144)|
| 3:55:49| These are purely administrative functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14149)|
| 3:55:52| And the external auditors, the internal auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14152)|
| 3:55:56| everyone has told us that the systems that are employed in those fee offices that are not employed at the county level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14156)|
| 3:56:04| are not very efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| I'll just remind you that the human resources assessment that Roderick Moss gave us in June of 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14167)|
| 3:56:14| pointed out a lot of human resource deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14174)|
| 3:56:18| And I'd like to make very, very clear, this is not a problem with the office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14178)|
| 3:56:25| When you have 25 people, full-time people in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14185)|
| 3:56:29| you can't have the same expertise as an entire human resources department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14189)|
| 3:56:34| And likewise, you can't have the same controls that a payroll of the larger part of the county has, or P card controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14194)|
| 3:56:45| I know Hugh Holt told me that some of the savings that you'll see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14205)|
| 3:56:50| now this isn't dealing with fraud or controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14210)|
| 3:56:54| is that if he sees that these departments countywide are ordering a lot of, for instance, printers for the computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14214)|
| 3:57:03| rather than everyone buying them separately at Office Depot, he can get together a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14223)|
| 3:57:09| and we can get these things much cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| We're talking about simple administrative efficiencies and administrative controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14231)|
| 3:57:16| Have you went to the fee offices and said, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14236)|
| 3:57:19| we'd like to have you do your payroll through central payroll, which they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14239)|
| 3:57:26| Have you said we would like for you to use the employee handbook in regards to leave policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14246)|
| 3:57:31| Have you went to them and said, hey, will you run all your contracts through and RFPs through the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14251)|
| 3:57:36| Hugh Holt and purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14256)|
| 3:57:38| Have you went and done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14258)|
| 3:57:40| I've not gone to every individual office and asked that they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14260)|
| 3:57:44| And that's the reason I put this resolution here before the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14264)|
| 3:57:48| is that we, as the commission, are asking them to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14268)|
| 3:57:53| And I think here's what I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14273)|
| 3:57:56| I believe that if we went to these fee offices and talked to them and not having to change the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14276)|
| 3:58:02| and not having to repeal an ordinance, rather, and before we change the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14282)|
| 3:58:07| ask them to do some of these things to be more efficient, more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14287)|
| 3:58:12| You know, as far as controlling their budget, I would like to see their budget come off the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14292)|
| 3:58:17| and all the fees turned back over to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14297)|
| 3:58:19| But they're separately elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| And without changing the charter, we can't fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14301)|
| 3:58:27| But if we ask them to or if we cooperate and try to gain cooperation before we have to change the charter to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14307)|
| 3:58:34| Well, the thing is, first of all, we're not changing the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| I think it's already there in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| I mean, I agree that that's a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| The sheriff submits a budget every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14321)|
| 3:58:44| He's an independent elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| The Board of Education submits a budget every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14326)|
| 3:58:49| They're independent elected offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14329)|
| 3:58:51| We're not interfering with their duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14331)|
| 3:58:53| All we're doing is asking them to turn certain administrative functions over to the county that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14333)|
| 3:59:00| by virtue of size and expertise, can be handled better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14340)|
| 3:59:04| No one's telling them what to do or what not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14344)|
| 3:59:06| Also, what the budget process allows is that it gives a forum for the budget to be discussed and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14346)|
| 3:59:13| I think it actually improves the fee offices standing in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14353)|
| 3:59:19| and with the voters to know exactly how the budget process in their office occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14359)|
| 3:59:26| I think there's a lot of benefits to these offices that aren't being enjoyed right now by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14366)|
| 3:59:35| And as I mentioned before, we've had the sheriff come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14375)|
| 3:59:40| We actually cut the school board budget $20 million last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14380)|
| 3:59:43| but we've had the sheriff come down here with his budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14383)|
| 3:59:46| I think he got just about everything he wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| I think every department got what they wanted because we're reasonable people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14388)|
| 3:59:53| but it was done in an open process and just the same way the school budget is done in an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14393)|
| 3:59:59| We funded them, but we really aren't interfering excessively with what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14399)|
| 4:00:05| Okay, this debate has a little bit different structure already evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14405)|
| 4:00:12| And if there's no objection on the commission, I'll rule that it can proceed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14412)|
| 4:00:18| Obviously, I think the two principals are probably Mr. Lockett and Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14418)|
| 4:00:24| And so what happened just then was a very civil set of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14424)|
| 4:00:30| and responses between Mr. Anders and Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14430)|
| 4:00:34| And so I think that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14434)|
| 4:00:36| If that's okay with the commission, we'll allow that to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14436)|
| 4:00:40| Otherwise, we've got to just call on people with their lights on in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14440)|
| 4:00:44| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14444)|
| 4:00:47| Okay, then we'll allow that to happen when Dr. Briggs or Mr. Lockett needs to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14447)|
| 4:00:53| We'll do that, and then I'll try to keep the order up as the lights go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14453)|
| 4:00:57| Mr. Pinkston, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| Yes, the first question I've got may be a little silly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14459)|
| 4:01:02| but I need to ask the law director this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14462)|
| 4:01:05| Since your criminal court clerk and your circuit court clerk turned money over to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14465)|
| 4:01:10| would they be sort of qualified as a fee office or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14470)|
| 4:01:16| They are fee offices, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14476)|
| 4:01:19| Well, I believe the Supreme Court ruled that they didn't even fall in under term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14479)|
| 4:01:23| So if this is for fee offices, wouldn't that mean we'd be having to take control of them too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14483)|
| 4:01:30| No, it wouldn't because the Supreme Court did say that they are accepted for various reasons in Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14490)|
| 4:01:42| But this does say fee offices, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14502)|
| 4:01:45| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14505)|
| 4:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14506)|
| 4:01:47| Well, here's one thing that I worry about a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14507)|
| 4:01:53| The gentleman that's writing this up for Mr. Briggs is a gentleman that pushed for this charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14513)|
| 4:02:00| Why he didn't just bring this out, if this is legal to begin with, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14520)|
| 4:02:06| But I do know that we have a law director here, and we had one prior to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14526)|
| 4:02:12| and I've heard several commissioners on here say that we have to follow the advice of our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14532)|
| 4:02:18| Whether it's wrong or bad, we're not lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14538)|
| 4:02:20| Now, as any reasonable man would know, if you go to court, you want a law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14540)|
| 4:02:28| Now, if it's something that is death-life threatening, you want a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14548)|
| 4:02:35| So I'm going to have to stand with our law director on this, in my opinion, because he is a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14555)|
| 4:02:41| And with all due respect, Dr. Briggs is a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14561)|
| 4:02:47| So, like I said, the reasonable man explanation, I've got to stay with our lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14567)|
| 4:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14574)|
| 4:02:55| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14575)|
| 4:03:01| I just wanted to reiterate some of what Dr. Briggs said about this doesn't take anyone's duties away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14581)|
| 4:03:12| It just moves all the administrative functions under one umbrella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14592)|
| 4:03:17| which does make more sense as far as efficiency and cost-saving measures go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14597)|
| 4:03:24| I have a tremendous amount of respect for our law director and what he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14604)|
| 4:03:28| but his job is to keep us out of lawsuits and what he gives are opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14608)|
| 4:03:34| And if you ask a different lawyer, you'll get a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14614)|
| 4:03:40| And he and I have had this discussion before that the best way to stay out of a lawsuit is simply to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14620)|
| 4:03:49| I think we've been asked by the people of Knox County to do something, and I think it's time that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14629)|
| 4:03:56| I also think this is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14636)|
| 4:03:58| This isn't a knee-jerk solution to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14638)|
| 4:04:02| And the other thing that concerns me, if we don't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14642)|
| 4:04:06| is that not all Knox County employees are being treated the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14646)|
| 4:04:11| Some Knox County employees have very fair hiring and firing practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14651)|
| 4:04:16| They have a grievance procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14656)|
| 4:04:19| They have the same pay structure and benefit structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14659)|
| 4:04:22| And I think that it's very important that we treat all of our employees the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14662)|
| 4:04:27| and that's simply not happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14667)|
| 4:04:29| So there's a lot of good reasons, I think, that this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14669)|
| 4:04:34| And I don't think that the threat of any impending lawsuits, which I think personally I think are unlikely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14674)|
| 4:04:46| will sway me from doing what I think is right and in the best interests of the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14686)|
| 4:04:55| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14695)|
| 4:04:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14698)|
| 4:04:59| Mr. Troyer, can you jump down here real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14699)|
| 4:05:08| John, we're talking about some of the offices that the payroll is being turned over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14708)|
| 4:05:14| Which office holders have turned that over, and who's still out there that's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14714)|
| 4:05:22| Because, I mean, the whole thing is about accountability, and that's what I'm hearing from citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14722)|
| 4:05:27| We've got the trustee coming online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| They're online right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14729)|
| 4:05:30| We've been doing the circuit court clerk, and we are working with the registered deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14730)|
| 4:05:38| And we have not worked with the criminal court clerk yet, but that's still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14738)|
| 4:05:47| And we're doing the county court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14747)|
| 4:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14748)|
| 4:05:49| So most of the office holders are turning payroll over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14749)|
| 4:05:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14753)|
| 4:05:54| We're in the process of doing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14754)|
| 4:06:00| See, what I'm saying to Mr. Briggs is that where most of the problems is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14760)|
| 4:06:04| If these payrolls are turned over, and I'm like Amy, you know, I want it out there and it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14764)|
| 4:06:11| But if we're turning it over to payroll, then things that would happen in the trustees' office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14771)|
| 4:06:16| that's not going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14776)|
| 4:06:17| We're not going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090427part1?start=14777)|
