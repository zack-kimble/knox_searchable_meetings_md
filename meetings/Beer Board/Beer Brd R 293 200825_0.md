| 0:02:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Thank you very much. All right, before we get started, I have a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| We have 13 beer permit applications before us tonight, as well as three addendum to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| As you can see, today's meeting, like July's meeting, is being held on Zoom, and that will make things a little different, like we've all gotten used to now in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=140)|
| 0:02:29| When I call the names of the businesses applying for your permit, please raise your hand in the Zoom session to speak or dial star 9 on your phone and dial star 6 to mute or unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=149)|
| 0:02:43| When called on, please state your name and address clearly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation will need to pick up their completed documents at the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| Applicants that have their permits approved tonight can wait until tomorrow to get them, because we're not there, so we'll have to do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=175)|
| 0:03:04| As I'm chairing the meeting, other members will have to make motions in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| Because our meeting is held on Zoom, you've already noticed that we've had to do a roll call vote, and that's why we'll proceed for the rest of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| First up, we've got, in Section 4, temporary beer permit form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| So that's the first part of our agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| And as you all remember, we had an emergency action in our last council meeting to provide for temporary beer service in expanded table service spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=207)|
| 0:03:39| And so that was passed, and really what this is designed to do is add flexibility for restaurants so they can expand their areas for physical distancing outside into spaces they might not have otherwise been able to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=219)|
| 0:03:56| We've actually got five temporary service area requests in our meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Each of those requests are actually located in Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| But I want to take this opportunity to remind all the businesses that might be listening that those spaces are not just for Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| They can be expanded outside that area as long as they're restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| So if you feel that would be helpful for you to have that flexibility, please go ahead and make that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| You'll need to have both a temporary service area permit as well as the permit from the beer board for the beer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| You all should see that information of the proposed form in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| I'd open up for any questions or if there's any motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| I'll move approval of the new form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| I got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I will second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I got a lot of seconds, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| I just needed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| More than one's always helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Oh, there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| I just want to ask that I would like to ask a question for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| I think people for everyone to clarify, this is for temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| It's while the emergency order is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| We discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| I just received an email from someone and there was some media and I want to make sure that was clear for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| I just want to make sure that was clear for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| I just received an email from someone and there was some media and I want to make sure that was clear for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| When you say it can be expanded outside of that market square area, can we just very briefly clarify what are the criteria for what it could be expanded to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| So the criteria is first that it's a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| And if they have questions about that, I think the first place they should go is plans review because they've got to get their temporary permit there first to expand the table service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=338)|
| 0:05:48| So what they're doing is expanding their table service outside of their normal physical space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| I don't know if that answered it or if you want Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Some more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Can it be in their parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| It can't take up their required parking spaces, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| What are the restrictions for where it can be outside of the confines of their walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| It could be in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| But that's why they've got to get it approved by plans review and inspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| OK, so that's something that could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| I just didn't know if we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| We're just leaving it open ended for them to discuss with plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| OK, plans will be reviewing that and making sure that it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| All we're doing is allowing them to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| OK, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Mr. Frost, did I get all that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| We're trying to make it as easy as possible to accommodate businesses right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=402)|
| 0:06:51| So good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Councilperson Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Just trying to get an idea of what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| A lot of the restaurants already have railings on the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| So will there be an extension of the railings as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| Will there be like a semi-enclosed space where it will be marked off with railings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| Or will they be able to just maybe put their tables out into Market Square without railings temporarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| I think in Market Square they've got railings set up out there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| But in the expanded space that's outside of Market Square, it could look like a tent or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| So that's the part that Plans Review and Inspection will review to make sure that they're doing all that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| I didn't hear from Mr. Frost, so I think I'm still OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Two for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| He would let you know, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| I'm sure he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Any other questions, comments, concerns, thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| OK, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| So I think we had a motion and multiple seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| So hearing no discussion, I'll ask Mr. Johnson to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| Councilwoman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=492)|

| 0:11:56| This was an existing license establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Right now, because of the change of ownership, they haven't been selling beer since that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| change of ownership, so we're hoping to resume that once the new beer permit is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=724)|

| 0:12:14| We are missing fingerprints and background check for manager Joseph Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=734)|
| 0:12:24| So yeah, Joseph Fox, he was, I think he's the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| I see him here listed as manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| I mean, hopefully didn't check the box wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Very happy to get it, but Charles Ellis is definitely the manager, and I think he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=762)|

| 0:12:47| Mr. Frost, since we have the president of the company that hasn't completed their fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| and background check, but I believe we have the manager, and do we have enough here, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| are we missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Well, let me ask Mr. Benson this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| I have on the paperwork Joseph Arthur Fox, and he's checked as an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=788)|
| 0:13:17| Is he an owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| He's indirectly an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| He is an owner of the owner entity, SCAPA Properties LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| What's his percentage of ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| I think SCAPA, I can double check, I think SCAPA is like a 20 or 30% ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| I think he owns it 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| Mr. Byrd, would you have asked, or Sergeant Coward, either of you all asked, why would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=830)|
| 0:14:00| you have asked Mr. Fox to get a records check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Was it because he was an owner, or I'm not seeing the paperwork where he's a manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| I had not understood him to be an owner, merely the president of one of those entities, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=850)|
| 0:14:18| the primary ownership entity, but one of the upper line entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Penston, was Mr. Fox asked to get a background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=865)|
| 0:14:34| Sergeant Coward, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Oh, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Yeah, I have his application here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| The manager part appears to be a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| He is listed as owner on his application paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=893)|
| 0:15:03| And Mr. Penston, you say he owns five or more percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Indirectly through an entity, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I was going to say, I pulled up the org chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Yes, Knox Central LLC owns 70%, SCAPA Properties LLC owns 30%, and my understanding is Mr. Fox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=920)|
| 0:15:29| is the owner of SCAPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Okay, so what is SMJT, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| That is the applicant entity that has purchased these assets, the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=937)|
| 0:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| You've listed SMJT as the name of the business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| It literally, I'm sorry, it owns the business, it owns and operates the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Well, if Mr. Fox owns 100% of that, which is approximately, I mean, 20%, I mean, Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| Coward, shouldn't he come to see you for a background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Yes, anyone who has over 5% ownership is required to do a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=979)|
| 0:16:29| That's here in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| It's always been my understanding if that's 5% of a direct ownership and upper tier owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=993)|
| 0:16:43| have historically not been asked to provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| Well, I think Mr. Byrd would tell you that, you know, if people send us org charts and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| you know, they own a, I mean, this is divided over two businesses and the name on the, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| the business owner is SMJT LLC, and Mr. Fox is the president of SMJT LLC, that seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1024)|
| 0:17:18| that would trigger a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| You know, my apologies, that's, you know, in the numerous applications that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1045)|
| 0:17:34| we've never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| So I'm not saying it shouldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| I'm just, we've kind of been going off prior practice and happy to comply with the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I'm not trying to be argumentative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Oh, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| We realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| I mean, you know, big, big entities like, for example, Aldi, where, you know, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| no one that owns more than 5%, you know, people don't go through background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| But I mean, this is, appears to be a small, closely held entity and I mean, Sergeant Coward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1083)|
| 0:18:16| were you expecting Mr. Fox to come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| I saw that Council Member Ryder had her hand up, so I'm going to call her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| Well, I just, so would this be eligible for pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| They just need to complete, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| Not for a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Not for a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Yeah, but we could, we could postpone for 30 days and have them come back in the September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I mean, the property owner information list, SMJT, you know, the, on the beer permit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1127)|
| 0:19:00| the notice of actions, where, who's going to receive service of process if there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| issue, lists SMJT, it lists Mr. Fox and gives the mailing address of SMJT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1145)|
| 0:19:18| So I'd respectfully submit that I think SM, or Mr. Fox, needs to undergo fingerprint and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| background check under the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Could we not remove Mr. Fox from the application as long as Mr. Ellis is here locally for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1168)|
| 0:19:38| of process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Well, if we had two managers and one manager was dropped, that was one thing, but, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| know, do we have, the problem is we have one owner, we have one LLC that's listed, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1187)|
| 0:19:57| and everything else that they filled out, the property owner information is SMJT, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| as Mr. Pinson noted, that's 100% owned by Mr. Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| I mean, I know, you know, under most circumstances, the Beer Board likes to let people get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1212)|
| 0:20:22| the business of selling beer, but I mean, unless someone points out to me, I'm missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| where this can go forward tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| So, yeah, if I may, just to make sure that I was interpreting it correctly, the way I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| reading it, the central filling station is owned by SMJT LLC, and SMJT LLC is owned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1239)|
| 0:20:48| a pair of LLCs, Knox Central LLC with a 70% share, and Scapa Properties LLC with a 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| share, and I gather then Mr. Fox is 100% owner of this Scapa Properties LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| So, let me get a little clarification here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| Obviously, the total of ownership equals 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| How much does SMJT own of that 100%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| SMJT is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| It operates and kind of owns the assets and the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| It doesn't own any entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| It is the applicant, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| We want the beer permit issued to SMJT LLC doing business as central filling station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| SMJT is owned by two LLCs, 70% Knox Central LLC and 30% Scapa Properties LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1302)|
| 0:21:55| Knox Central, the 70% owner, is owned by three trusts, 70%, 15%, and 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1315)|
| 0:22:03| The 30% LLC, Scapa Properties, is owned by Joe Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| So, 30% of the overall ownership is with Mr. Fox through another LLC, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1332)|
| 0:22:28| The question on the application says, you know, what are the owners of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| The owners of the applicant are Knox Central LLC and Scapa Properties LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| You know, is there anyone that owns 5%, and I believe this question has always been interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| quite literally to mean who owns 5% or more of the applicant directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| If there's intervening entities, then, you know, we, you know, I mean, we have filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| you know, maybe hundreds of applications with the city, and this is, you know, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| level of ownership has never kind of been requested in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| I understand what you're saying, and I do feel better about that, Mr. Pinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| I just kept seeing all of these blanks on the forms filled in as it really was SMJT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| And I apologize for that, if that was misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| It was unintentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| It was unintentional confusion, which might be easy for me, but I appreciate you taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| the time to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| So, you know, I don't think, based upon that clarification of the ownership structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| I'm not sure that Mr. Fox needed to come in for a fingerprint and background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1431)|
| 0:24:00| but I guess we're all learning here for the future, applicants having better, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1440)|
| 0:24:08| clarification on what entities are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| So, hearing from Mr. Frost, sounds like we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Do we need to amend to remove the name of Mr. Fox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Well, no, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I mean, you know, obviously, an LLC is a legal fictional entity, but, you know, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| person back there, but, you know, he's, I believe, is still listed as the person who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| going to receive notice of the ‑‑ if there are any proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| So, hearing that we can move forward, any further discussion or are there any motions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| So we're good with the one named person, Charles Ellis, and we can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| You have to have local contact people and the manager, and they do have both on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I would like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Well, actually, we need to wait, because I got ahead of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| I need to ask Mr. Byrd if there's anything missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Because we got bogged down in the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| We do have one little thing the file still needs, health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| We hopefully will have that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Folks, this is Charles Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=1544)|

| 0:43:55| So, Mr. Bailey, I know that you've had a lot of work to get where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| And so, I know that it's not always ideal to extend over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| But I know that we've had some circumstances that are a lot out of the ordinary with COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| hitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2653)|
| 0:44:13| So, I'd like to make a motion to postpone them for another 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| Time to get everything ready for inspections and approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| As a point of clarification, because they've already been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| you're extending them for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Well, I'd like to extend them for 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| Because based on my conversation...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| I meant to say extend, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Yes, 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| And, Vice Mayor, they had originally been approved pending file documentation in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2689)|
| 0:44:57| of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| When you have that discussion with them, do you want to talk to them about another background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| check since it'll be after a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| For the sake of clarity, the meeting following 90 days would be the meeting in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| December 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Wow, this year's gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Do you want to make it October 22nd so it's that year date to extend them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| So, I guess that would be 60 days, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| And then they'd be coming on the year anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| Because I'd hate for them to have it completed and then still have to wait to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| So, let's go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Well, they can pick up the permit at any time, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| Well, if we're going to ask them if they haven't done it by that point, because it'll be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| year to have looked at doing another background check, I think that's the reason we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| about doing it in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| So, extend to October 20, is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| So, I've got a motion to extend Aurora Restaurant and Grill to October 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2774)|

| 0:46:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Mr. Johnson, do we need to call the roll on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2788)|
| 0:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2788)|

| 0:46:30| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2790)|

| 0:46:52| And I would, I meant to mention for Aurora, they did turn in their server compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| since our last discussion with them, so they have been making some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| All right, next up is 5B, that's Fat Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2822)|

| 0:47:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| This was one originally approved back in July of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| You were extended on October 22nd, February 25th, and again on July 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| I understand that since our last discussion in July, you've gotten a new background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2862)|
| 0:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Sergeant Coward, how did that go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2866)|
| 0:47:46| There's no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| And Mr. Byrd, we still need building inspection, fire and health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| And how much time do you think you need to be able to get those completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Well, our situation, I don't know if you heard, but the original owner of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2882)|
| 0:48:10| sold the building, so we're waiting on the new owner of the building to take over so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| proceed with construction of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| I'm hoping 90 days, hopefully end of November, early December, will be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2901)|
| 0:48:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2911)|
| 0:48:41| So we can either...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| I just want to say that it's going to put us well past a year of the background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| Well, he's got a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Oh, they've been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| He did a new background check, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| So I think our options, we could extend or we could, you know, it's been a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| but he did get a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Well, I think that's the primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| So if there's been a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| And how much more time would you be looking at, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| Well, the new owners are going to start middle of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| They take over so we can start construction in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| It should take six weeks from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| From there, if nothing pops up, we got our plans approved and everything's going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| We're just waiting for the sale of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2980)|
| 0:49:48| So I'm hearing six weeks potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Yeah, it's been a year, but he did get a new background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=2991)|
| 0:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| So in the background check was David Lynn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| That was very recent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| It was in July, I believe, right, Sergeant Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| We just got it back a couple of days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Okay, so it was just a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Okay, I'll make a motion to postpone for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| So it's a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Okay, it's a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200825?start=3039)|
