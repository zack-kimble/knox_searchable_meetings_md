| 0:01:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=60)|

| 0:01:29| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Thank you all for being here on short notice, and I know the last thing any of us want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| do is discuss masks more, but due to this week's events, the law department recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=96)|
| 0:01:44| that we meet as soon as possible to discuss policy C-240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| And so, do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| I would like to actually object to this agenda entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| First, the Sunshine Law requires that we give adequate notice, and while our policy says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| 48 hours is adequate notice, for many of the people who are impacted by this policy, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| not adequate notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| Our staff, our teachers, are required to give three days' notice if they want to take personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| So, there's no possibility that they could be here to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| So, the fact that we couldn't give them adequate notice, and that that's a Sunshine consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=155)|
| 0:02:45| that alone should be enough reason to not have this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| Collaborative conferencing has not had a discussion about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| In August, we set working conditions for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| They knew what to expect for this year, and to change those working conditions for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| last three weeks with no discussion with our collaborative conferencing team, which should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| be happening under the Professional Educators Collaborative Conferencing Act, is seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| There's really no legitimate reason to meet because we don't have any new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| We met two weeks ago, and two weeks ago, we knew that Executive Order 77 was set to expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| We knew that, and it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| So, what has happened since then that changes that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Absolutely nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| We knew it was set to expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| We had that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| We don't have any new information, and it's certainly not an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| The next reason we shouldn't be having this meeting is because there was no Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Order that required this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| This policy was brought, let me check the date, it was brought in August, August 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Ms. Satterfield brought the policy because she wanted to decouple it from our dress code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=254)|
| 0:04:26| She felt that the dress code policy and the penalties for breaking dress code policy should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=266)|
| 0:04:35| be different than for this, and at that time, this board voted to adopt this policy separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=275)|
| 0:04:43| from that dress code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| It wasn't required by Executive Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| We did have Executive Order 55 at that time, and that Executive Order said that face coverings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| in schools and higher education institutions, I'm sorry, that's the heading, local education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| agencies, schools, and institutions of higher education are strongly encouraged to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| the policy requiring the use of face coverings by students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| It wasn't a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| There was nothing that said we had to do it, so when this expired, there's nothing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| says it has to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| This is completely optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Additionally, it has been reported several times that the Governor's Press Secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| has said that ending these Executive Orders has nothing to do with schools and that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| can have whatever policy we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| So, since there's no Executive Order that required the policy, there's no Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Order that ends to stop the policy, I don't see that we have an emergency that requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you for sharing your opinion, which we're getting into kind of the substance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Can we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Mr. Watson, do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=365)|

| 0:06:48| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| So, we have four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Unfortunately, Ms. Satterfield couldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| So, do we have, would someone like to reconsider their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=423)|
| 0:07:13| We have a 4-4 vote to approve the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=433)|
| 0:07:33| I'm going to ask Mr. Dupler just to state the reason that the law department asked that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=453)|
| 0:07:44| we have this meeting and then we can, if someone would like to reconsider their vote, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Otherwise, we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| We felt that the board would be wise to have a meeting because obviously, although we suspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=477)|
| 0:08:06| that there would be changes upcoming at the end of this month, we didn't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| We don't like to project things and say things before they happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| But earlier this week, things did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| The governor revised his executive orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| That was kind of the first shoe to fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| April 27th, which was Wednesday, he indicated that he was taking away local authority for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| face coverings and taking away the Tennessee Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| He also issued guidance saying that that applied to all counties except for the six local health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| But even then, and this is probably the biggest reason why the law department recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| some type of meeting of the board, is that he is requesting that mask requirements be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| lifted no later than the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| So with that, we knew that there was additional information out there and felt that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| needed to weigh that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Now, it's also true that the governor and the director of the Tennessee Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=555)|
| 0:09:24| and the mayor, of course that was the other thing that happened, was the Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| Glenn Jacobs, released masks for businesses in Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| And that happened almost simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| I think that was the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Let me make sure I've got my dates correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| I know the governor's order went into effect on the 28th, and then Glenn Jacobs' order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=585)|
| 0:09:53| went into effect on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| But everyone has said that the board is able to make its own decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| School boards are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| So that's certainly the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| School boards are still left to make their own decision as far as masks within the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=605)|
| 0:10:13| So ultimately it's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| But our office is simply saying that, you know, the governor is looking at asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| mask requirements to be lifted no later than the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| So that was the biggest reason for the ask that the board take this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Ms. Christie, was your light on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| I just want to say my reason for not approving is the fact that Ms. Satterfield is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=639)|
| 0:10:47| I would approve it otherwise, but she is the one who brought this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| And I feel now that more than ever we need to make sure that, you know, the First District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| has a voice at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| And, you know, it's not because she purposely chose not to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| I think we all know that she had scheduling conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| But, you know, if you want to call it at a time when she can be here as well, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| vote differently on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Mr. Dupler, just to clarify a couple of things that you stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| You said two different, you referenced the governor's actions twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| The first time you said it, you said he's requiring by the end of May that mask mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| be lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| And the second time you said he's asking for mask mandates to be lifted, which is two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Can you clarify what the governor actually did in relationship to the end of May, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| it relates to the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Well, I mean, and I was, and I apologize if I was unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| I mean, there are, and there's a lot of people that are unclear about the executive order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| because it wasn't just an order that just came in and says, hey, we're just wiping away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| It wasn't that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| But what it did say was that there is no requirement for face coverings in the 89 of the 95 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=721)|
| 0:12:10| Of course, Knox is excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| They're one of the, or we're one of the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| So his executive order doesn't directly apply to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| But then Mayor Jacobs made his order apply directly to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| However, neither one of those applies directly to the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| I mean, that's been clear throughout the orders and the language is that, you know, the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| systems are left for the school boards to make their own decision because school boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| have control over their respective school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| So, but it also said, but the mayor's also put out language saying that he's requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| and he's not requiring, but he is requesting that mask requirements be lifted no later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| than the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Again, you know, we're not saying the school system has to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| But what we're saying is under that guidance, you know, the recommendation would be toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| So at our last meeting, and several people referenced this in emails that they sent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| me, is that we had a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| It was a very specific conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| I think Ms. Christie brought it up first, and then I engaged in conversation with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Mr. Dupler, about where our authority comes in order to even require a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| And at that time, I believe what you said is because there's the current state of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| that gives us that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| The state of emergency has not been lifted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| Again, that's where things get confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| I'll read out of Governor's Executive Order 80, which is the one that was handed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| April 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| What it says is, I, and then Bill Lee, etc., etc., do hereby declare a continuing limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| So under that, I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| So there is a continuing limited state of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| That's why our office says that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| So the reason I'm voting voted no for this agenda is because this agenda is re-deliberating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| a topic that we have now met about 8 times, 9 hours of discussions, and 55 public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| We literally made a decision about this 2 weeks ago, and we all were in agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| if the Governor did something that lifted that state of emergency, then we would secede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| So to me, the only agenda item to be discussed is, do we still have the authority to re-litigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| what we want to do or not do, to me, is not honoring the will of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| The will of the Board, 2 weeks ago, made a decision, and I know it was a 5-4 decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| I know it wasn't a majority decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| If we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| I can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| If there's a substitute motion that changes the agenda to say, let's have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| about the authority of the Board to implement what it's already agreed to, then I can vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| for that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| I can't vote for an agenda that re-litigates something we've litigated for 9 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Ms. Spab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| Yes, I'd kind of like to address this also, and several other people have done it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| I'm going to refer back to what Mr. Dupler has talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| The emergency...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I mean, what the Governor came out with the other day was talking about the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| That is not what is on our agenda to pass today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| It is to pass something that becomes immediately effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| And we all got a recommendation last night from the Superintendent, which actually much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| more goes along with what the Governor recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| And it was to let end...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Go through the end of May, which would get us through the school year, which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| we committed to our students and to our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| And I really have a problem with thinking when that was the thing the Governor came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| out with, there was a need for an emergency meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| When we're meeting next Wednesday, regularly scheduled, and that would have us time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| deal with what the Governor came out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| I see no reason that this was an emergency today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| There are some things going on in our school system that I do think are emergencies, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| this is not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| As Mr. Watson has talked about, we just talked about this two weeks ago, and we are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| a meeting next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| And I think at the Wednesday meeting, it could come up and talk about actually dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| what the Governor asked for, which is sunsetting it at the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| So, for that reason, I can't agree with this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| I think Ms. Owen was next, and then Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Just following up on what Mr. Watson said, in addition to re-deliberating, it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| that we have made this decision and that we made it two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| We additionally voted not to have a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| So, we additionally voted that we were going to suspend policy and say that we weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1035)|
| 0:17:23| going to talk about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Yet, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| I won't be supporting this whether we deal with it today or we deal with it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| If the Board recalls, two weeks ago, I made a friendly amendment to end this at the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| But, no, this Board wanted to extend it until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| So, I withdrew my friendly amendment, and we wouldn't be here today if those five votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| would have accepted and approved the friendly amendment that was made two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| because it would have aligned with the Governor's ask, if you want to call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| that all mask mandates end at the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| But, here we are today, because this Board wasn't satisfied with a May, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| a May end date, they wanted to extend it on in through the entire summer so that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| one of those children in summer school were masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| So, I won't support this either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| So, I just find it very frustrating that that amendment was made, it was voted down by four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Just a brief comment in regard to Ms. Owen's comments that it was not a legal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1122)|
| 0:18:54| I believe, I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| I believe that the 48-hour notice would apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| Also, I believe that anybody that lives in Knox County, or works in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1143)|
| 0:19:16| that is impacted by this, is aware from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| She talked about some people in the media not knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Well, some Board members have done everything they can on media to stir it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1167)|
| 0:19:36| for lack of a better term, and make sure everybody was aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| So, I don't think there's any question but what any reasonable person that is impacted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1182)|
| 0:19:57| knows something about it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| To clarify that, I'm not saying that people don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| I'm saying that a 48-hour notice, when our teachers require 72-hours notice to take leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| so that they could be here to address us, that is not adequate in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| I agree our policy says 48 hours, and I agree that that normally would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| And if we were having this meeting at a reasonable time of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| when people who are working and kids who are in school could actually come and talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| then that would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| But when we're having this in the middle of the day while literally everyone impacted is in class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1239)|
| 0:20:48| that's not reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| With all due respect, Ms. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| do you believe that if we had it, let's say for argument's sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| at 5 o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, next Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| do you think that this, since you're so interested in teachers being represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1271)|
| 0:21:21| do you think the hall would be packed with teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| I believe that any teacher who wanted to be here and any student who wanted to be here could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| That wasn't what I asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Whether they choose to be, I can't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Answer what I asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I have no way to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| You don't have any way of answering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| The question isn't whether they would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| The question is whether we give them the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| The reason the meeting was scheduled now is really because when we polled board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| board members were able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Ms. Satterfield had until, I think, 10.30 that she could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Once we saw that we had so much public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| there was no way that she could extend her time past that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| and so that's the reason for her absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| When we scheduled the meeting, it was understood that she could be here at least until 10.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| and so whether we could have gotten the whole meeting in in that time frame is unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1339)|
| 0:22:27| However, when the law department asked that we add this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| I didn't think that if we put it out for a Thursday evening that we would have better attendance anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| It is certainly during the workday, but it's up to this board to carry out the business of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| and so we tried to schedule it when board members were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I think we had Mr. Watson and then Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Ms. Bounds, I appreciate you bringing up some of the discussion that we had two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| and I do remember you making that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| and I also thought there was some wisdom in that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I will also remind the board that the discussion we had prior to the mask policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| was related to superintendent's recommendations for guidelines for this coming school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| and the reason that I did not go with May at that time is because we had just agreed to follow his recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| which is Tennessee Department of Health guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| which at that point recommended masking in schools, which would have been in effect in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| and so by choosing a date of May last or two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| we would in effect said we're going to sunset a mask policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| and then for two months of summer school, we have no guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| and then at the start of August, we would then have guidance again to re-mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| That was not something that I felt like was something we should do to our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| and our teachers and to our parents to have that back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| and I think Ms. Owens' point is valid, but also we did hear from a lot of people from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| Just in two days, this is not counting any prior e-mails that I've received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and you all have a copy of this chart at your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Just in two days, I received 346 e-mails and voicemails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| which is way more than any other time we've had this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| and I categorized them by parents, doctors, nurses, teachers, students, and principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| So out of parents, we had 257 e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Sixty-seven percent of them, 171, said, why are we talking about this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| Please don't change this at the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Doctors, we only had four total, but 75% of them said, please don't change this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| Nurses, we only had five total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Three of them said, please don't change this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| Teachers, we had 65 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| Ninety-one percent of them said, why are we changing this right now, potentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Students, only 11 responded, but all 100% of them said, please don't change this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| Principals, four of them reached out and said, four total, 100% said, why are we considering changing this right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1502)|
| 0:25:11| I know Superintendent Thomas also did a survey of all principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Mr. Thomas, do you have those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Seventy-four percent of principals wished to keep the face mask policy like it is until the end of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| So total, out of those 346 respondents, 73% said, please don't change this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| I don't think that this is a decision that we need to be making simply by public opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| But if that is your view, that this is a public opinion decision, obviously the public opinion is, why are we talking about this again right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| And also, in fairness, we know that we have over 60,000 students in this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| So a 346 sample is not representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| But of the people who chose to elevate their voice, it was a clear majority that said, please don't change this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Ms. Hounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| I'd like to make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| First, to Jennifer's comments about the collaborative conferencing and 72 hours notice to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| Being an educator, I understand that that is what is required of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| I also understand that having taught in this system for 23 years, if I had wanted to be off today, chances are my principal would have granted me a personal leave day or I could have just called in sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1584)|
| 0:26:39| So that might have gotten me in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| But I do know that while 72 hours is the goal, that is not always what is practiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1602)|
| 0:26:52| And thank you, Mr. Watson, for your point that I did make that friendly amendment that it would end at the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| And I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| But I do want to say that if the public believes the mask policy is effective, they've either not been in the schools, which has been limited this year, or they're unaware of what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1622)|
| 0:27:18| This mask policy is not protecting their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| I talked to one of my principals the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| He said, and we all know that in middle and high school, it is very difficult the springtime of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| And you can imagine with Governor Lee's order and the mayor, whom everybody highly respects as Cain, come out with the no mask policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1654)|
| 0:27:44| The principal said, you know, the kids walking down the hall and I tell him to put his mask up because that's what I do all day is police the kids and tell them to raise their mask over their nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1664)|
| 0:27:55| And he looks at me and he says, the governor says I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| And the mayor says I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| Madam Chair, Madam Chair, a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Sir, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Our discussion as a board right now is moving into deliberating this agenda, which that's not what I've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| I've been deliberating whether or not this agenda is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| We have a vote that is 4-4 that says we're not meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| From my understanding, if it's a 4-4 vote, then the agenda fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| I'm fine with us continuing discussion whether or not we want to bring back an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| I do not want to deliberate masking when that is the agenda item that just got voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I'll take Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| We have several lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Do we have other comments regarding the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Ms. Bounds, are your comments complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I don't know if Mr. McMillan had his light on or Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Just a comment in reference to what Ms. Owen said about teachers being required to wait three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1743)|
| 0:29:14| I suppose that it still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| There is such a thing as emergency leave, and most principals, I've found, will grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1759)|
| 0:29:30| If you have to have emergency leave for the next day, or even if you call and explain the situation that morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1770)|
| 0:29:43| they will grant it on the spot if they, you know, deem it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| That's contrary to what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| If someone from the executive team could help me out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Since we are testing right now, is personal leave even allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| And do we know how many schools are testing today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1812)|
| 0:30:22| So during this testing time, during these weeks, is personal leave allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1822)|
| 0:30:31| Mr. Bolton or Mr. Reiswick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I can, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I can probably address the testing issue, and then Mr. Bolton may have to on the leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| So the window is open for testing, and schools have flexibility to set their testing window how they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| I do know, I don't know everyone's schedule sitting here today, but I do know that some, if it's not a full testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| that some schools do use this as like make-up days to make up for portions of tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| So I would feel reasonably confident to say that there is some testing going on in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| and I can't tell you specifically which schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you, Dr. Reiswick. Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Thanks, Madam Chair, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| In regards to personal leave, it is at the discretion of the principal to approve a personal day, which is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| There are some parameters around the personal day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| There can't be a certain number of employees out of the building at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| It gives discretion to the principal to make that approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| But as far as the testing, I'm not for sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| All right, if we do not have a substitute motion for the agenda at this time, our meeting is concluded then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1899)|
| 0:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| We will vote you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210430-special-called?start=1913)|
