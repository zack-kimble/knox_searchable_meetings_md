| 0:03:27| First, I want to welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| We have a group of Cub Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| It's PAC 255, AOL Den, from Colonial Heights United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Would you please stand so we can recognize you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| They are about to become Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| So congratulations and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| So we have a couple of great events coming up in the next few weeks that I want to make sure everybody knows about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| I don't often report on individual events at our public assembly facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| but we have something special coming to Chilhowee Park this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| From this Friday, March 16th, to Sunday, April 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Knoxville's first ever Dragon Lights Festival will occupy the Midway area at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| This should be an amazing show with 42 large lantern displays lit by thousands of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Mary Bogert and her team at SMG have worked tirelessly to bring this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| and I know they are really excited to have an attraction that is expected to bring thousands of people over the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| So you can find out information about it all at dragonlightsfestival.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| And next weekend we head into our annual spring festival season with the 2018 edition of the Big Years Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=280)|
| 0:04:48| This year, Big Years will run from Thursday, March 22nd, to Sunday, March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| In those four days, there will be more than 120 musical performances, film screenings, public events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| art installations, and other unexpected happenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| If you've been to Big Years, you know the only thing you can count on is that you will be surprised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| and I can vouch for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| As I said before, I usually walk in not knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Jesse knows all these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I go in not knowing who they are, and I'm always pretty much blown away, if not shocked, every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| Sometimes it's traditional stuff that you're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| Sometimes it's really kind of mind-bending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| It's an interesting assortment of music that always inspires and entertains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| This year, the city was happy to sign on as a sponsor to help support some of the free public programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| including a Fiddler's Convention on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| So if you don't buy a ticket, you can still participate in the free public programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| You can find information on the schedule and tickets at bigyearsfestival.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Finally, maybe less fun than those events, but still important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Now, that's in my notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I can't believe you said that, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| We're talking about my annual operating budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| Those are pretty exciting for anyone who's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| They will take place over three days from Monday, March 19th, through Wednesday morning, March 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| Different departments are scheduled to present their budget requests each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| These hearings are open for council members, the media, and the public to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| Sometimes it's standing room only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| It's so popular for these operating budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| But you can find the full schedule on our website at knoxvilletn.gov slash budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| The hearings will be held here in the city county building in room 453, particularly invite council to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| It's where my department heads present the budget to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| We ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I always give council a chance to ask questions if you want to at the end of each of their presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| So please come if you're able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Are there reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| I wanted to, I guess, let everyone know that Councilperson Singh-Perez, Councilperson Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Councilman Campin and I will be making our debut as your Scruffy City All-Stars on March 23rd at noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=437)|

| 0:07:39| I just want to invite everyone to come cheer us on and put together your own team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| This is a great event that's going to raise money for Fountain High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| but also other charities and non-profits as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| Our team will be challenging a team from the county commission as well, so it will be very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=471)|

| 0:08:16| You know, actually, we should practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| I would encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=499)|

| 0:08:36| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Maybe we can get some Big Ears attendees, because I don't think there's a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| at least the morning portion of the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| We encourage people to go both places, both to the neighborhood conference and to Big Ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Would you like to give us a report on your newborn baby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| The baby's doing fantastic, except when she screams at us for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Besides those times, it's really, really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Okay, any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Okay, let's move on to resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| 11A is a resolution renaming the Knoxville Convention and Exhibition Center as the World's Fair Exhibition Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| We have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| 11B is a resolution commending the East Tennessee Office of the Chapter of the Leukemia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| and Lymphoma Society's Man and Woman of the Year campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=574)|

| 0:09:43| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Rather than read this into the record, what I thought I'd do is just take a few minutes to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=586)|
| 0:09:54| Many of us may not realize, but every three minutes, somebody is diagnosed with blood cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| And just for our Boy and Girl of the Year and their families, what I thought I'd ask is those here and in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=599)|
| 0:10:07| if you've had an experience or a loved one's experience with cancer, can you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=607)|
| 0:10:17| Cancer really affects so many in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| And many of you may or may not know, but Sarah actually lost her mother to leukemia in 2005, and I lost my uncle in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=620)|
| 0:10:30| This resolution is really recognizing the important work that the Tennessee Chapter of the Leukemia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| and Lymphoma Society is doing right here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Through groundbreaking research initiatives, LLS is discovering new treatments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| and therapies helping all who suffer from cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Most people don't realize that nearly 40% of all new cancer therapies were first approved for treating blood cancer patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=646)|
| 0:10:54| LLS is literally funding the fight against cancer, with 18 new approved FDA therapies just last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=654)|
| 0:11:03| LLS funds local support groups where patients have grants and access to prescription drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| and assistance to those who are fighting cancer here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| This resolution also recognizes two very brave young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Lily Bittner, who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia B cell when she was six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| and Sawyer Dyer, who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia when he was seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| Lily and Sawyer, do you mind standing up for us for a quick second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Lily and Sawyer are now both eight years old, and while they're continuing with their treatments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| they're also serving as the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's Boy and Girl of the Year in 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| to help raise awareness and much needed funds to help cure and support those battling cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| So maybe we can all give them a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Finally, I just wanted to say, Lily and Sawyer, that you're not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=719)|
| 0:12:18| Everyone in this room, as well as those who are watching at home, support you in your fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| as well as those who are struggling with cancer today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Thanks for all you're doing to help, and with that, I'd like to move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Thank you, Councilman Roberto. We all do share in what you just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so, order. Thank you all for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| and accept a 2018 Emergency Solutions Grant Award of $161,250 from the Tennessee Housing Development Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| with the required local match of $150,000, $140,000 of which is to be provided by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee, and $10,000 is to be provided by the Voluntary Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| for a total grant amount of $311,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so, order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Helen Ross McNabb Center Incorporated to provide funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| assistance to reestablish the Knoxville Early Diversion Program in an amount not to exceed $74,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Ms. Barbara Cook has signed up to speak on this. You know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Ms. Cook, please state your name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you. Do I get to see the timer up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| We don't have a timer up there. I'll just have to tell you when it's up to a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| You have your timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| I did this once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Set our timers, get them in sync here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| I'm Barbara Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| As you all probably know, to speak before this council on an issue, one has to state a position that is either for or against the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| That's unfortunate, because I am not against treatment and real help for folks with mental health issues or those for whom prostitution is a way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=881)|
| 0:14:57| What I am against is pouring money into programs that are open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| Jail diversion is not and should not be the goal for providing services to people with mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| Providing services to folks in need and just providing services is not an end unto itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=910)|
| 0:15:18| The grant program referenced in this agenda item, the one this proposed program is supposed to reestablish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| is the exact grant I used as an example when I spoke to you at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| One million dollars over three years to divert individuals from the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| Only 21% of the original goal of diversion and only 33% of the original case management goal were provided service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=940)|
| 0:15:49| many of whom were prostitutes, supposedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| None of the demographics that I've been able to obtain with regard to that program breaks out prostitutes from the rest of the population served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| Yet support for reestablishing this program uses the results from this grant as justification to reestablish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| Three years of experience with prostitutes should be enough to provide an estimate of the size of the problem in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| $322,000 annually for three years should have produced a database of known prostitute encounters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=980)|
| 0:16:29| what resources and treatments were made available to them, and whether or not they are still practicing their trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| At the very least, an idea of what worked and what didn't should provide a very specific roadmap toward future treatment and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=995)|
| 0:16:48| If indeed Helen Ross McNabb has extensive and unique experience in diversion programs, as was stated on the agenda information sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| they should be able to provide specific goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1014)|
| 0:17:04| For example, reduce the number of prostitutes operating in Knoxville by 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| Of course, this would mean they knew how many there are and would require keeping records of what treatment and assistance was provided to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1032)|
| 0:17:24| And whether it actually achieved the desired result of active prostitute reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| In-depth, reliable data must be collected and analyzed to determine best practices to guide the more worthy goal of healing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1052)|
| 0:17:43| and removing them forever from the possibility of future encounters with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| I totally get the dilemma you face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| A good number of you haven't been on the council long enough to know what took place in 2013 when the original grant was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| You know how you're expected to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Hey, it's a small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| Jump change when compared with the huge dollars in funding that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| I must admit to you there is a much larger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| It is my hope that you will become involved in the process of deciding what results you expect when you approve funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| and what you can expect in the way of specific, measurable results and program accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| I also hope you agree that jail diversion is not and should not be the goal for providing services to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| Services to folks in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| And just providing services is not a solution in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| Please ask that these providers address the issue of prostitution and not jail diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| And ask them to provide verifiable data that those whose lives are affected are indeed being made better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| Not just being treated over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1151)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| I know we have representatives from McNab here, so I would like to ask them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| They have asked us as part of our addressing the issues downtown and along Broadway there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1177)|
| 0:19:48| they asked us to continue this program and to contract with McNab to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| So, Leanne, would you like to set your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| Good evening. My name is Leanne Heumann-Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| My name is Candace Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| I am Senior Director of Intensive Mental Health Programming for Adults with the Helen Ross McNab Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| So, would you just like me to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| Just tell us some about the program and why you support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| Sure. So, I would agree with Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| I would say that our project that we had that was funded through the Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1233)|
| 0:20:55| that was a subcontract to us, it was originally from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| We were audited by them very successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| We were highlighted by them. The Federal GAINS Center came in to audit us and actually had other places around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| come and look at us for actual pre-diversion programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| There's not a lot of programming who can do really well at pre-arrest diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| So, I would also say that I think the goal didn't start out as just serving prostitutes or individuals identified with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| We had a very large group of individuals we were targeting for the pre-arrest diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| When we were awarded this, we met with the department and with SAMHSA and with KPD and narrowed that focus down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1297)|
| 0:21:46| We would rather serve, I think at that time we felt like the more intensive we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| and we could be with a smaller number of individuals served, we would have better outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| And it yielded better outcomes because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Chief Rouse, would you like to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Thank you, Mayor. I would add that obviously, and I agree, that diversion is not the goal, it's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| Diversion is the process to get to the goal, and that's to make individuals whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| And I can confirm that Helen Ross McNabb is a great partner in looking at those human aspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| and trying to heal those in our community who are broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| And they're great partners and we had an absolute huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| And this is a program that has been replicated and written about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| And we thought it was valuable to again embark upon it because of the successes that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| And in terms of the number of prostitutes in our area, that number is like the number of homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| It changes daily because of all the other issues that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| Individuals drop in and drop out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| And so it's not a number that we can sit here and tell you that today we have 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| That number changes daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| And so we want to help as many as we can and to get them out of this lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| and to, quite frankly, make them whole again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you. Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| So I am kind of familiar with this process, though I am new to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| I have had conversations in the past with Lieutenant Bush. Did I get the title correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| It might be in front of my house. It might be at the end of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| And it's been a common conversation among business owners as well as residents in my neighborhood over the 12 years I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| So I know that I've had conversations with Lieutenant Bush about how effective it is, how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| And it's not so simple to give somebody one treatment and expect them to be cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| It just doesn't work that way. Unfortunately, that's what we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Can you tell me if someone calls in a complaint to KPD and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| hey, I see somebody working the area, what happens from that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| What's the officer that comes out trained to do? When is it initiated for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| I'm a very pro-caseworker, social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| I think we need a much higher rate that we can't afford, unfortunately, for both our homeless and our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| going back 12 years ago, if we could pour funds into caseworkers and social workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| we would get ourselves so much further ahead, because that's where we're really lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| That's not the reality that we can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| So when one of my neighbors or a business owner calls in a complaint about somebody working the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| because they territorially do that, what happens? What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| We have kind of two avenues of getting involved with individuals that are practicing prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| Lots of times we'll do ride-alongs with police officers, or if the police officer gets a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| we will meet the police officer in the field, and at that point in time we'll do an assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| and we'll start that process of trying to engage that person in treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| You are right on with the fact that it takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| And I think what we know is that we stuck with these people for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| Sometimes it took us months just to get them to engage with us and trust us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| because if you look at all the trauma that they've gone through, whether it's past trauma, present trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| there's a lot of issues, and sometimes it takes a lot of time, and we're prepared to stick with those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| But that's how we would get involved with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| So if you had an issue, you could call KPD or whatever, and then we would meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| So when we do stings, do we employ this program or the social workers in that capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| Yes. We were involved in a couple of stings where we were around the corner, and you might want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| Sure. So we do include them in our sting operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| as well as we have an advocate at our Family Justice Center that we incorporate in that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| because many times you find that individuals may be human trafficked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| and so we want to make sure that we're screening for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| So it's all part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| So we have an advocate, we have Helen Ross McNabb's caseworker that is there with us to determine the best route to handle these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you, and thank you to McNabb. We appreciate what you do. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| Okay. So who made the motion and the second? Will didn't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Finbar and Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| Oh, you made the motion, and Finbar made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| 11E is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a quit claim deed to Debra Haynes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| for one parcel of property located at 2744 Tarleton Avenue, parcel ID number 082KG037| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| within the limits of the city of Knoxville pursuant to the homemaker's program for a contract sales price of $22,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Becky, remind me, remind us exactly on this homemaker's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| This is a house that's in pretty decent condition, and from the outside it looks that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| And what time frame are they under, and what do you think, and what are their plans for this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Becky Wade, director of community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| It looks like some of our other properties that are acquired through the blight process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| This was acquired through foreclosure, so it is not necessarily in as bad a shape as some of our properties that we sell through homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| The buyer proposes to rehabilitate the property, bring it up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| and then rent that property to a low-income renter, someone with a voucher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| and they have a year to finish the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| So they have six months to start and a year to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| And you have history with this buyer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| Yes, this purchaser has done some great work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| They've purchased several lots in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| And you all follow up on it at some point, I guess, in six months, make sure they've started and they have progress reports and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| As you know, if work isn't done in a timely manner or if the job isn't completed, the city does have the authority to take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| I think it's important to partner with people you've got a history with like that and show good results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| It's not before us on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| So this particular property owner, they're purchasing this property through homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Are they using or applying for additional programs through the city for financing, like BRF or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| Just the homemakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1786)|
| 0:30:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1806)|
| 0:30:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1816)|
| 0:30:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1841)|
| 0:30:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1864)|
| 0:31:12| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1872)|
| 0:31:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| There are samples of the lights already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1895)|
| 0:32:05| So there's a fair number of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1925)|
| 0:32:35| We're going to split the facility into six zones, really more for just our ability to digest 30,000 lights in bite-sized chunks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| And so those same zones will be how the installation is phased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| So we don't know exactly which zone we'll start with, but the idea would be they would work on one zone, finish it, move to the next, finish it, move to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1967)|
| 0:32:56| The exception being we may treat interstates differently and just do all the interstates at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| But that final schedule in terms of the phasing of the zones is still kind of to be determined based on how long the design takes in each of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1981)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you, Erin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you for taking the time and taking the time and taking them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Just give me the numbers again of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| So especially for those of you who joined Council since December when we first looked at the MOU for this agreement, in a nutshell, the city does not currently own streetlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| What we do is we pay KUB 100 percent of the cost of running the streetlights, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Half of what we pay them, $2 million approximately, is the energy that the streetlights actually consume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| And the other approximately $2 million, it's actually a little north of that, closer to 2.3 in 2017, is what's called a facilities charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| And that is what covers all of the maintenance budget for the streetlights as well as debt service and kind of all this other embedded cost that KUB has taken on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| That facilities charge has been a long arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| It is following kind of TVA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| It's been in place for many, many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| I compared it in the past to an adjustable rate, never-ending mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| So essentially the way it's determined is not actually based on real maintenance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| It's based on the total value of everything that KUB has put into the system ever, multiplied by a percentage rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| And that's covered around 14 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| So at the end of the year, it comes again to about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| That is an unsustainable model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| Both KUB and the city recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And so one of the goals in this project, in order to achieve any type of maintenance savings, is we've got to replace that facilities charge with direct maintenance costs, because LEDs are so much cheaper to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| So long explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| The idea being we need to, in order to get rid of that facilities charge, pay off the remaining stranded costs of the system, so everything that KUB has not been able to recoup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2117)|
| 0:35:26| That value is estimated at $5.6 million that you see here, including all the lights, the cables, you know, poles that are ours, such as the decorative poles downtown, as well as equipment and things that will be able to be used in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2126)|
| 0:35:40| Moving forward to repair the system as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| So that's where the $5.6 million comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| When we do that, essentially what we're doing is we're paying off the balance of the mortgage, and then we will own the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| Good analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| The difference of electricity, the difference of the light bulbs is going to change, is also going to get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| So total, all total, all in, we're in for $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| That's what's budgeted, and we do expect to fall safely within that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| In terms of the annual savings, we'll get, again, these are ballpark estimates based on initial frames, but we're very confident that we're, if anything, underestimating the savings as opposed to overestimating savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| We expect to save at least a million or 50 percent on the energy side, so half of our energy cost goes away when we replace with LEDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| We totally eliminate the $2 million by the facilities charge, but, of course, now we have to pay direct maintenance costs, of which there will still be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| So we are ballparking $1 million of ongoing maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| That still leaves us net $1 million left over from removing the facilities charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| So we're looking at ballpark, again, saving $2 million a year when you combine the energy side along with the maintenance cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| And so we're assuming a contract that KUB has to maintain these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| You're outsourcing, right, the maintenance of these, and initially we're assuming that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| We are going to piggyback on it, so I wouldn't say assume because I think that means something slightly different, but we are going to piggyback on it under state law allows us to do that, and that will ensure a smooth transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| And so we will continue that going forward, will they or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Right, so under the proposal you have today, that contract would run April through December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| That gets us all the way through the retrofit project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| That would take the next nine months to evaluate whether, for instance, we would continue to directly contract with a company like ServiceOne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| or whether we might look at bundling services under a much larger master service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Okay, thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| So the big picture is we're more energy efficient, more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| We change out all the lights to LED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| We absolutely appreciate KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| They've been excellent partners in a very complicated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Okay, any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2289)|

| 0:41:36| 12B through J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Good afternoon. Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| Currently we enforce several building construction codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| We have four different appeals boards, which requires 29 different appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| Of the four boards that we have right now, one of them is active about eight times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| The other three boards, they rarely, in the four years that I've been with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| have had to meet. Therefore, those board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| it's not part of their schedule. When we do need them, it makes it problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| The most recent example would have been the Farragut Hotel and the French Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2542)|
| 0:42:32| The French Market was going to request a plumbing variance, but it was difficult to get a quorum to find the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| remembered they were on the board and weren't associated with either one of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| Anyway, this is intended to consolidate it down to a single board that's made up of folks who have a diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| background and knowledge in building construction who can listen to the appeals and render a fair decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| It just makes sense to utilize people as opposed to appointing people and not necessarily utilize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2579)|
| 0:43:11| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| Thank you. What you're saying here is for each of these boards, some that I see electrical here and some different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| So you're saying that we'll go from 29 people to nine people that have some specialized expertise in the area that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| being appealed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| That's correct. Of the four boards that we have right now, there are several positions that are duplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| So we might have an electrical engineer or a mechanical engineer on the plumbing board as well as the mechanical board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| So there might be three different mechanical engineers, whereas under a consolidated board, there would just be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2626)|
| 0:43:58| A mechanical engineer on the plumbing board, a mechanical engineer on the mechanical board, and a mechanical engineer on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| building board consolidated. So there's a single representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| Right now we would only have one electrical mechanical engineer on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| And so I guess I'm just a little perplexed that we'll go from 29 down to nine rather than maybe looking at we would have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| people on the board for each of those areas of expertise. And so what is your thought process as it relates to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2664)|
| 0:44:34| I don't think it's necessary because everybody is familiar with construction techniques that's on the board, except for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| consumer rep. So whether you're a mechanical engineer or a mechanical contractor, you're still familiar with all the aspects of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2680)|
| 0:44:50| construction. I didn't see the need for the redundancy on a single board. That's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2690)|
| 0:45:01| We didn't have that redundancy on the individual boards, so I'm not sure if creating that redundancy on a singular board would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| helpful or would add value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| And so how long did people that have utilized the appeals board, do you have some figures on that? How many appeals do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| normally have in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| We usually have about eight. Eight to ten in a year. Ten is a strong number there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| And have you had any feedback that was not in favor of the downsizing of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| We reached out to all the stakeholders, whether it be the Home Builders Association, the Architects Association, and really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| feedback that we did get, other than thank you for letting us know, was that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. No more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| I would like to say that over the last few years and throughout our administration, we've really looked at several different boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| You know, they start years ago, and they may have served a purpose at the time, but as things change, then we like to reevaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| them. So over the years, a former council has made some adjustments, like the solicitations board was no longer necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2771)|
| 0:46:20| And there's been some others like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| So I appreciate Peter taking a look at all these different boards that rarely met. And by consolidating, you know, we have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| that are meeting month after month, and then whatever the appeal is, they're fresh, they know, you know, they're up-to-date on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| rules, they've got it on their calendar, and we can be more responsive to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| And it's my understanding that the individual boards were created back during the era where we had different divisions that didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| necessarily talk to each other and coordinate and work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| So four years ago when I came, the building inspectors sat in one area, the plumbing inspectors sat in a different, and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2816)|
| 0:47:04| little coordination. We're trying to break down those walls of divisions and work as a solid unit that can help our customers, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| matter what their issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| And also talk about how they have multiple disciplines now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| So we have a construction where instead of, if you're building a new house, having to schedule four different inspectors out there, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2842)|
| 0:47:30| can schedule one, and they're qualified, they're certified to inspect all the disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| And actually, we make sure we go one step beyond and make sure that they've been approved by not only their building supervisor, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2855)|
| 0:47:45| we have an electrical chief who is in charge of that trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| So they get approved not only by the state, but also by our chief level inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| So it's part of our modernizing and updating the department, and with it the appeals boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you, Peter. Any other questions from here? Okay. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=2883)|

| 0:52:14| Counsel, we are now at public forum. We have two people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| The first is Selina Capps. Is Selina here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| Thank you for being here, ma'am. Please come on down and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| Selina Capps, Knoxville, Tennessee, 10021 Bluegrass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| On February 27th, I came here, and I was in a very good mood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| I came here to complain about the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| One of my favorite movies growing up was The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| On February 27th, when I spoke about the angry white male driver and the gun, I had called 911 and informed them that I was being terrorized by what I believed was a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3169)|
| 0:52:59| Since I was not 100% sure, nothing was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| It took the officer over ten minutes to respond after being terrorized and told by 911 to back off, so I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| The KPD failed me. I felt that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| I felt that had it been a white woman being terrorized by a black male, the outcome would have been different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| There was no bolo place for me. Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| This was the ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| So infuriated, I called IAU and spoke with Sergeant Chadwell. He is the bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| During the call, I felt Officer Henderson blew me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| I said the next time, I won't be honest, I'll just lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| Well, Officer Henderson informed me that I was on tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I also felt that I was not acting like a person who had a gun pulled on them when he was listening to the audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| Note to everyone, if you ever have a gun pulled on you, make sure you flip out, act crazy, and that way maybe they'll believe you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3235)|
| 0:54:04| Different people handle stress differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| Officer Henderson and Officer Chadwell also said it was my word against the driver's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| They said that was true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| However, they said that they would have at least called a bolo in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| That's all I wanted was a bolo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Only thing I wanted was someone to call and check and find this man and find out what his reasonings were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| Officer Henderson said that I should have had a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| Officer Chadwell sold me a very nice camcorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| I have a nice camcorder for my front of my car and for my rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| So that way I will be protected the next time something like this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Then after talking to Sergeant Chadwell, he told me that I should maybe call the Knoxville County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| because that was actually their jurisdiction and they should be the one to handle the police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| And he also informed me that if I did call them, he was going to make sure that he sent the tape over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| stating that I had said that maybe the next time I would lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| Well, you know, I don't take threats too kindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| And so I told him, go ahead, send the tape over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| I didn't really care because I had told him up front when I called IAU the first time that I had said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| I don't like being threatened by Sergeant Chadwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| Also, I am trying to get a copy of the 9-1-1 tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| I do not feel that I should have to pay $50 for this tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| I have left messages for Alan Ball requesting that I be allowed to come and listen to the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3348)|
| 0:55:54| That's all I want is to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| Without the assailant's description, they do not have the correct license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| And the only thing I want is just the ability to just listen to the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| Now, I want to get to the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Clarence Vaughn and the PARC were a big asset to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| Clarence believes in building bridges, not walls between the citizens and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| He helped me conduct research on my own and helped me get answers to my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| One thing I would like to say about the good, and that is Lieutenant DeBow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| Lieutenant DeBow is one of Knoxville Police Department's finest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| He treated me with respect. He did not blame me. He did not criticize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| He told me things could have been handled a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| He treated me kindly, and that's all I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| So I think that you all should be proud of Lieutenant DeBow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| He is a good man, and he should be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| And as far as Sergeant Chadwell, maybe he needs a little bit of people training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| Is Robin Harris here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| Robin Harris still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Okay, she must have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Okay, council, that is the end of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| And I just want to again tell Will what a great way to spend his birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| Maybe he'll be lucky next year to fall on a council night as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| Anyway, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180313?start=3461)|
