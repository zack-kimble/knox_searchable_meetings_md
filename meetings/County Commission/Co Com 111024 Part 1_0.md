| 0:02:23| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| I'm going to ask you a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I kindly ask that you answer out loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Once I'm finished with your questions, then I'm going to defer to our staff and question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=148)|

| 0:02:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| And I'm going to skip several questions we would normally ask, because this is a first-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| application for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=169)|

| 0:03:21| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| This is the first time that we have had catering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Mr. Law Director, would you tell us about this, since it is something that we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| had come before us before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Under Tennessee Code Section 57-4101, a person who has a catering business and who is desirous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| of selling beer within the county limits can apply for and receive a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| This gentleman appears to meet the criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| It is really the decision of the Commission as to whether or not you want to grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Sir, are you going to be serving the alcohol, or do you have a liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| I just obtained my liquor license Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| The service will be off-premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Who is doing your serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Are you going to have ABC cardholders serving your service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| I was going to ask the same question along, but only on the beer permit, this catered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| beer service, they have to comply with rules and regulations that would surround the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| that they cater to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Is this what we're headed toward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| Essentially, but he has obtained a state alcohol beverage commission liquor license as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| which, of course, as you know, relaxes the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| So that's something that I did not have to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| So then I guess my only other comment is we need to be careful here, I think, in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| did you run track in high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| Well, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| We may not be able to catch him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| It was my brothers that were the ones that were really the track people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I was more of the wrestling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| So if you catch me, you better be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| That's why we have Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| We'll just send Wolfie and see how it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| And I have a question, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| If something happens, if he's at a party and somebody gets out of control, does it fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| back on him or does it fall back on the host?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| What happens there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| No, I mean, under the dram shop laws, essentially, he's going to be responsible because of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| state and county licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| He can't do anything that's violative of our state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| So if he, for instance, is serving people who are clearly intoxicated, he has liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| You understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| You've been doing this for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| By the way, folks, commissioners, how long have you been in business now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Forty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Forty years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| They do first-class work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| I'm glad to have you in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Just be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Don't be afraid to tell somebody no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Actually, I just completed the course here a couple weeks ago and really found it informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| A long time ago, I bartended when I was in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| Of course, it was before the ABC requirements of having a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| But I found that to be an extremely informative class, and I'm glad that it's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| And we'll just tell you right up front, too, that the Sheriff's Department will be by within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| six months at one of the parties and try to catch somebody underage because people like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| yourself come up, and then six months later, they're back because somebody sold somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| that was underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| So just have your people on their toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Sheriff Jones, we're on the one application for a caterer's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| He appears to meet all the requirements of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| He has obtained a Tennessee State Alcohol Beverage Commission license and has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| a server's course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Do you have any questions or comments, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| No other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Sir, before you leave, see the young lady over there in the red scarf with her hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| She has a present for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| No other items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| We are adjourned until 1.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| There's one other one on the Kimberlin Heights General that someone had, I think, Joe, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| had asked Wolfie to go by and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| Apparently, it's a location that they, it's never been open, but they deliver and serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| beer there or sell beer like six cases a week or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And Wolfie's left me a message that says he's been by there on a number of times and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| times of the day and has never found the business to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| We did contact him by letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| He called our office and said he is currently physically incapacitated and could not appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| today, but likewise asserted he was not currently serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| So what we'll ultimately do once he's ambulatory, we'll bring him in and either have him have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| the license revoked or in the alternative, he can demonstrate it's still viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| No other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| We're adjourned until 1.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| I'd like to call into session this portion of the Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:21| This is the time where we have a public forum and honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| As of right now, we have no one signed up for a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| We do, however, have a very special honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| And I would like to ask if Anne D. Acuff would join me at the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=513)|
| 0:09:00| She said this is a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| We have a resolution that I would like to read, if it's okay, and read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| But first of all, do we have a motion that we accept this resolution in honor of Anne Acuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| And I'm sure it's by unanimous consent of all the commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| So, Anne, we're going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| And we want you to know that a lot of your colleagues are here because they knew that this was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| She said she was surprised, and that is by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| We wanted it to be a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| The resolution reads thus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Whereas Anne Acuff has been an invaluable employee of Knox County government since September 1, 1965,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| when she accepted a position in the Finance and Administration Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| By the way, she was the youngest ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| She was three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| And so she was kind of a child prodigy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Whereas administrations and even systems of Knox County have come and gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| but for over 45 years, Anne Acuff has remained at the center of the Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| And whereas Anne plans to take a much-deserved retirement from her position as Accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| and Budgeting Director after November 18th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| and whereas Anne's dedication to excellence, precision, and fairness have been an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| and a standard for employees to aspire to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| and whereas for decades Anne Acuff's hard work has been instrumental in producing the award-winning budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| and financial reports that have become such a hallmark of the Finance Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| and whereas Anne's professionalism, institutional knowledge, work ethic, and ability will be sorely missed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| and her personal warmth and grace will be missed just as deeply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| and whereas it is wholeheartedly agreed among Anne's colleagues and friends that someone may fill her space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| but will never take her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| So therefore, resolved by the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| the County Commission honors and commends Anne Acuff for her 45 years of laudable service to Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| and the people of Knox County, we extend to Anne our very best wishes for much happiness in retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Anne Acuff, and it is to take effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| And I understand that Sheriff Jones says that you can speed today and you will not be arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| So that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| And on behalf of the Knox County Commission and the citizens of Knox County, Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| if you would come forward, and John Troyer, I know that you all would like to say some words as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| but we want to wish you well in your retirement and let you know you are going to be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| And thank you for your service, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| We have a proclamation, and ironically enough, the words are identical except for one misspelling of her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| It's not Anne Acuff, it's Annie Acuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| And it is now officially I'm going to supersede you, if that's all right, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| We're changing it to Annie Acuff Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| And I did note that she's been here 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| And I was trying to think what was I doing on the day that Annie started working here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| I was probably getting my diaper changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Oddly enough, the day she leaves, I might be getting my diaper changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| But anyway, Annie, we love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| You're wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| You are my favorite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| And she also has got a pond in her front yard she said I could come fish in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Although, as I went to her pond and saw it, I could probably fall down and fall all the way across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| So I'm not really sure how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| But, Annie, I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| You're wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| And we are going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| And you are one of the finest employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I've been in public service now for over 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| And you're one of the finest people I've ever worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| And I truly mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| You're wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you, Annie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| I'll just keep it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Ann, you've earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| This is a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| And what was even more of a surprise, it said Ann Acuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| Now that it is Annie Acuff, I feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| But I've truly enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| It's been a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| And I've enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| I've been blessed to have had my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| I've worked with really great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| I've worked for people that are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| I owe a lot of gratitude to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you all for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:24| Mr. Chairman, I did talk to the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| and he said that if she does speed, if she gets over 85,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| that they would turn the taser way down, but that she'd still be able to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| Also, do we have another resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Mr. Mayor, did you have another resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| We've got one for Gary, but he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Obviously, he didn't have a permit to speed today, so Gary's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| But when he gets here, we'll surprise him also, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Well, this concludes all the resolutions that we had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Again, Ann, Annie, congratulations to you, and we wish you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| We are adjourned until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| We'll go back into session at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:20| Call to session, the October meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=860)|

| 0:14:44| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| We do have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Our devotional today, well, I was looking for Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| He's going to ascend from the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| Commissioner Brown is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Let's go ahead and proceed to our Pledge to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Commissioner Wright, if you'd lead us in the Pledge to the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| I would ask that you stand to give proper courtesy to our country's flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| and give the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:28| Next item is the approval of minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Do we have a motion that they be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| It is so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Do we have any amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Yes, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| I was wondering if we could add, as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| what was in the paper on Friday about some of the county's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| There may not be a final answer until the auditor's report is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| Please give us some idea because we're getting a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| and a lot of calls about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| If someone could just tell us something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| and tell the public something about what's going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| We will add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I just wanted to add a discussion just real briefly about Hillside's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| just update what's taken place in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Another discussion item on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Would it be possible that I could call on Professor Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| now that he has arrived to give our devotion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| We'll finish this item and then we'll come right to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Commissioner Shouse, did you have an amendment you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I wanted to take, thank you for asking me, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| I want to take 802, 803, and 804 off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| 802, 803, and 804 will be taken off consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| and we will hear those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| If not, do I hear a motion that needs to be added, added, and deleted, deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| The agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| So, Commissioner Brown, if you would have our devotional for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Since we are between 9-11 and coming up on November 11th, which is our Veterans Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| I thought it would still be appropriate that we kind of honor some of those that serve us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| This is a story that probably didn't make the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Some of you might have heard it before, but when that flight hit the Pentagon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| it hit real close to where the nursery was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| which there was a whole bunch of babies and toddlers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| The attendants there were, you know, how are we going to get these folks out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Suddenly, a young Marine comes in the door, and he says, what can I do to help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| She said, well, we've got to have some help getting these folks out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| So he leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| She thought, oh, well, he's left us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| We've got all on our own again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| About two minutes later, he comes back in the door with 40 Marines in tow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Each one of them grabbed a crib, a heavy crib, and they didn't have a crib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| They picked up toddlers, and with the nursery workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| they took them outside to a safe place in a park out of the danger zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Then, reminiscent of the old West days, the Marines put those cribs in a circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| and inside the circle they put the toddlers so that they couldn't get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| And those 40 Marines circled those cribs until the parents came for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| or until they weren't needed anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| That's just one example of the unsung heroes that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| We recently commemorated the ones who died in 9-11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| and those that served in 9-11 that are still living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| But I think it's important that we remember those who do service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| because they do it on a voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Nobody is conscripted into anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| They do it because they want to make a difference, and that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Ronald Reagan had one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| He said, Most of us wonder if our lives made any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Marines don't have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| So, you know, we could add a few others to that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| but at this time I would like for us just to take a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| and remember some of those who are serving us domestically and on foreign fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:26| Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| and we thank you for all the opportunities that you give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| We thank you, Lord, that we live in a free country where we can assemble as we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| to carry on the business of our county and our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| We ask, Lord, that you be with each of these who are serving for us to keep our country free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| at home and abroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| As we go through this meeting today, let everything we do be done in accordance with your will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| These things we ask in Christ's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| One other thing that I meant to add on the agenda as an amendment to the agenda was the resolution honoring Ann Acuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| So that is there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Next item, drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| We don't have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| So we have no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Do I hear a motion on transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Do I hear a motion that they be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| They are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| We have 129 notaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Is there a motion that we approve the notary applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1223)|

| 0:26:53| but maybe have some of the candidates that would like to present themselves to us in a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1613)|

| 0:27:02| And I believe we've already got about four or five citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| and any citizen who's interested can still send us a resume, but, yes, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| But we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| I didn't count the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1630)|

| 0:27:14| to present themselves to the commission before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1634)|

| 0:27:53| So do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I'd second it for 30 days or the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Does the mayor have one or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1676)|

| 0:29:14| First, I guess, you know, I have a curiosity about an expense like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| I realize from a budget standpoint, these are federal dollars that fund your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| These are not local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| But when I read things like water, isotonic water, low-calorie water, it's kind of like water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:40| So I wonder about, from your standpoint and a budgetary standpoint, why do we, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| are we doing, in your estimation, a good job with the funds that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| I mean, I just, you know, I think about as you prepare a budget, like you have to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| That's a hugely complex thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| And to spend $750,000 on what is essentially water seems strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Because of the fact that we are financially independent, we receive no local tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| we have to look for opportunities for categories in which we can meet customer demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| And our customers, the students, are asking for bottled water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| They're asking for flavored water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| They're asking for low-calorie isotonic drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Like there's several beverages that are out there that are low or zero-calorie drinks that they would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| They also are part of the American Beverage Association approved selections for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| And we also meet the requirements for grades K through 8 requirements for the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| as far as the regulations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Bottled water is a huge industry in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| There's 8.6 billion gallons of water sold annually and $4.1 billion worth sold annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| For us, it's, like I said, an opportunity to generate revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| It's certainly not a condemnation of the water supply here in Knoxville and all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| One of the most recent changes that we've instituted here in Knox County schools is we are offering a hydration station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| within the cafeterias where we're providing cups at no charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| and we're providing water for the students so they can go through and they can get municipal water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| If there's not a water fountain, they can get cups of water as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| And so the water and the isotonic drinks are items that are for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| So, although it's a $750,000 line item, over several years, it is not a non-revenue generating product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:56| It's an item that we're going to be selling for an upcharge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| And I understand that kids are subject to these very intricate marketing efforts that these businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| that supply these things are out there pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| And I just wonder, I guess I just would hope, from your standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| are we doing everything that we can do to promote kids using this very adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:33| and excellent public water supply that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| So, I know that budget items are budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| And even though this is separate from the locally supported operating budgets, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:52| I still just wonder about as you sit down and prepare your budget, could we be saving money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| Could we be reallocating monies in ways that are just more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| than satisfying maybe what kids want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Kids want a whole lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| And we don't give them everything they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| And so maybe that speaks to some educational efforts on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| But, you know, it's just a strange item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Well, like I shared, we are offering them an opportunity to have water at no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| They can have the municipal water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| So if there's not a water fountain, we still have pitchers of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| The opportunity for us is that the customers, the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| are demanding bottled water and flavored water and isotonic beverages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| It's not something that is a detriment to our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| And it actually provides an additional opportunity for us to be able to meet our financial requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| for our labor, for our cost of food, and for our cost of utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| and other things that we pay for through our school nutrition budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I guess I'd just, you know, at the end of it, just ask you to evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| see if it goes with the ñ if it fits, parallels the goals of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| And just because kids demand it doesn't mean we have to supply it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Commissioner, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| And I think that's something that we take very seriously and really want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| There's sort of a complex interaction between interest and demand and nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| And I think Mr. Dickel is really expert at trying to make sure that we provide our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| with very nutritious meals but also make them attractive so that kids are interested in participating in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| And I think he's done a great job with that in a variety of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Some of the things that he's been able to do in his short time here, providing many more fresh vegetables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| our farm to school program, he's really pushed and made happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And things like Hispanic Heritage Month a month or so ago really brought some ethnic options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| into the menu for our cafeterias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| And I think he's doing a great job of finding that balance between making sure that these are attractive options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| that students are interested in and making sure that they're nutritious and meet our interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and making sure that students are healthy and making healthy choices so that they can be strong learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Dr. McIntyre, this may not be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I don't know if you can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Really, it's a Bob Thomas question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| But this 750,000, and Tony alluded to it there just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| what will you turn that into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Because if you spend 750, you'll actually make how much for back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And I know each of the schools, and they depend on this now, what kind of revenue will this generate for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| If you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| It's our cost of goods sold is about 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| So our pricing strategy for beverages is around 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So you're going to make an additional 40% on top of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Additional 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Additional 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| And, Commissioner, as you know, that will help us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| make sure that this is the school nutrition fund is self-funding and self-balancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| and allow us to provide great options for meals for kids that are nutritious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| and that are attractive so that they'll participate in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| So it really does help us make sure that that program is both solvent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| and meeting its goals in terms of making sure kids get healthy meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| The next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| The next item is on Page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| It's Resolution 408, Approving Contracts for Green Waste Disposal Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| with Nature's Best Organics of Tennessee, LLC, $14.41 per ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| for the disposal of green waste and no charge for pallet disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and Knox Ag, Inc., doing business as Shamrock Organic Products, $28.82 per ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| for the disposal of green waste and a pallet disposal fee of 50 cents per pallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| You know, I spoke about this at the last meeting about why it has some objections to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| You know, there was a contract that was signed back probably about eight years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| where there would be revenue sharing between the county and with Nature's Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| And really what it said was that the county would pay so much as a tipping fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| when we took trash and brush out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| By trash, I mean green waste out there, and then they would grind it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| There were other waste products that were organic waste products that were brought out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| some from composting and some for other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| And then when this was sold to the public, the county would get so much per scoop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| And from about 2003 when this was started up until 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| the county didn't get anything, according to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| When this was finally looked at, it was finally brought to the attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| it wasn't the county that found that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| There was not good contract monitoring on the part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| And just in summary, what happened, there was a mid-level county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| who basically told Natural Resources Recovery, or NRR, that they didn't have to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| and that that would serve as an offset for some of the allegations that NRR had made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| that somehow the county had not lived up to their contract on the part of guaranteeing so much green waste to be on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| when they moved in, which wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| And also that was not guaranteed in the contract, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| Then there was supposed to be so much green waste that was brought there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| that could be ground and sold, and at least on NRR's interpretation, that threshold wasn't met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| There was supposed to be a license for composting out at Forks of the River that the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| according to the contract, may or may not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| That was not guaranteed in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| That was offset by them withholding the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| And there were some other things that I won't go into because of the limitations of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| But the bottom line was that if this had not been picked up, we still wouldn't be getting the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| and the debt would be getting bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| We asked an independent researcher to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| It was Pan Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| I believe she was a former president of the Tennessee Bar Association to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| And we also had our own internal auditor look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| And then a citizen also filed a key TAM suit in Chancellory Court, in Judge Weaver's court, over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| And the basis of the court suit was a false claims made, and there were several parts of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:58| I think at this point, and I'm quoting Judge Weaver's report on this when he said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| is that the county was owed, and this is exactly the numbers that Pan Reeves came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| and also our own internal auditor, Richard Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| that the amount in revenue sharing fees that were withheld from the county is $311,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| There was also a false claim from Matthews Grinding for about $27,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| And I'm not going to go any further with some other claims because those may or may not be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:34| At the workshop meeting, I asked that we vote against this just because to be fair, let me also say that in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:43| there was a settlement signed between the county and NRR that basically said that we'll just forget everything if it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:53| In retrospect, I think that was a big mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| There still is this court case that is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| and I'm not going to try to read the whole thing, but these are the judges' word in chancellery court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| and I realize that NRR is not here to defend themselves, and so I want to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| But according to the judge, there is no dispute that NRR acted in concert with a county appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| to obtain payment from the county of a false claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| There is no dispute that NRR, in position of the county's revenue sharing fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| which the evidence presented showed to be approximately $311,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| No dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| There's also no dispute that there was a false claim filed with regard to Matthews Grinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| I won't go into all the details of what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| This case is still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I'm going to change my mind on what I said the other day about why we should reject this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I think we should give some consideration to reject it until the court case is finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| but that didn't appear to be the wisdom of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| But what I would like to do is to make a substitute motion, and that is, if this goes ahead and passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| which I think it will from the evidence that I saw at the workshop last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| I'd like to make a substitute resolution that if the courts do indeed, when they render their final judgment, state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:29| and uphold that the false claims and what they refer to as the reverse false claims are justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| then the contract that we're about to pass be void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| I think that's fair to NRR because, as we like to say, they have not had their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| We're taking it out of my judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| We're taking it out of everyone's opinion as to whether this is, you know, is right or fair or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:58| We're leaving it in the courts where it probably should belong because everyone deserves their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| But if the courts do indeed find that this was a false claim, that the county didn't get the money that they were due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:10| then the contract should be voided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| Point of clarification, when you say finds that the false claims were justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:21| are you saying that they will be found guilty of false claims to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| Is that your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| That's what I meant to say, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| In other words, the courts will uphold the key tam action of a false claims and reverse false claims being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| The motion has been made in seconded that it be approved subsequent to the court disposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| In other words, what we'll do is if it's the desire, I mean, if this is all, if everything is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| then that's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| But I would say that we go forward with this, let the contract that was bid out go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| But if the court finds that the false claims and reverse false claims were justified, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| they find that they were guilty, I don't know if that's the proper term in civil action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| but finds in favor of the plaintiffs rather than the defendants, then this contract would be void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| because it would be an affirmation by the courts that there was, I guess you would say, a willful disregard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:26| and an intentional holding of the county's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I agree with part of what Dr. Briggs said, but I've done some looking into this on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:45| This is set up totally different than the process that we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| If you look, it says per ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| We were paying by the load, and a guessing game was going on last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Both of these folks have scales, and they weigh this stuff as it comes across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| For the public's benefit, if you weren't listening last Monday, there was only two bidders in this for this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:10| One of them is exactly double what the other one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| If we went with just one of them, it's going to cost the county a whole lot of money to take care of what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| These folks have two places that this can be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| It can save the county a ton of money on doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| And last Monday I also asked Mr. Vanderveet if he had any problem in putting in some restrictive audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:44| checking up on whatever you want to call it, and he assured me that that was in there this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| And I believe, Mr. Law Director, if any contract that the one of the individuals is found guilty of something or other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2751)|
| 0:46:01| doesn't that automatically void the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Well, depending upon, sir, if it's directly related to the contract, it could conceivably void it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| If there's any kind of misfeasance or malfeasance directly related to the contract, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| When you look at the price of gas and man hours and trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| when you take a truck that's got two men and they've got to take two hours to run a load, you know, out there, it costs a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| That's why there's a second one in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| It's cheaper for us to take that load to the more expensive place because they're back on the job quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| So, as I say, I believe we'll save a lot of money going this route, and I believe we have enough controls in place this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| You know, fool me once, shame on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Fool me twice, shame on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| But I think we've got enough controls in place this time to be sure that that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| So I'm in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Commissioner, if it's okay, we have two people at the podium who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| I'd like to go ahead and hear from them, and we'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| So if you'd give us your name and address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901, here on behalf of Nature's Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:10| I would urge that you vote against the proposed or amended resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| First of all, there are a couple of problems with it, and I yield to perhaps the law director on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| I've got my own thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| But you have one resolution dealing with two contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| And if there's a subsequent voiding of the action taken, I would submit to you that it'd end up voiding both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2850)|
| 0:47:40| You can't separate out in the resolution, separate out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| We're going to take one action as to one part of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and a different action as to the other part of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| So I think there's a technical problem there and a legal problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| In addition to that, and I don't want to get back and argue the issues in connection with the pending lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| I would simply note, for those who may not recall it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| that everything that had occurred prior to the memorandum opinion that Dr. Briggs is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| was done on the basis of evidence introduced only on behalf of the Quaytown plaintiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| There was no testimony, no presentation, and no participation on the part of NRR at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:31| The $311,000 is not perhaps something contrary to what Dr. Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| but my understanding is that it is not a yet quantified number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| That is what the Quaytown plaintiff has alleged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| That's the number that everybody has used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| But I do not believe the county has ever itself quantified the amount that's in dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| When we get around to getting our proof in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| I think that number is going to be different than the number that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| But be that as it may, the most significant part about that past history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| and we're talking about past history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| is that this body voted when you were a 19-member body, 19-0, 19 to nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| to ask the parties on behalf of the county and the parties on behalf of NRR to go to a mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| and see if they could resolve their differences about how much, if any, they owed the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| or how much the county was obliged or perhaps obligated to them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| And the county asked for numbers from our client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| It's not something we actively initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| We were asked to put it in and make it part of that mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| That was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| A number of representatives of the county, including a member of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| signed off on that mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| And for a period of three years, as a result of the mediated settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| we paid to the county a minimum of about $72,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| Now, all of that relates to past allegations of shortages on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| past allegations of difficulties with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| and it's not doing some of the things it was supposed to have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| And that matter was resolved on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| What you would do now, if you did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| and if you could make it effective is to say, okay, NRR, we say you did something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| and now you've agreed to settle and dispose of that matter by paying the county some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| Yes, they operated the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| but they paid the county some money that they weren't otherwise obligated to do until they undertook to do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| And they paid them that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| And now what you say is, having done that, now we're going to punish you all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| I think that that matter, that mediated settlement resolved those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| The issue about who owes what and why, as far as that court case is concerned, is over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| and it will be resolved over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| And the court can make whatever findings it wants to make and do whatever it needs to do with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| And I submit to you that this is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| This contract for both of the vendors is terminable at the will of either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:28| The county can get out of this contract and terminate this contract on 30 days' notice without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| There's no need to have this kind of thing built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| If, indeed, there's something that occurs and it appears to be proper that action be taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| I believe the county executive and the administration can make the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| as to whether they should terminate the contract or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| And they'll have the benefit of looking at the numbers, seeing what it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| see what it costs if they did it, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| But I do think there is a problem, Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| It just sort of caught me cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I hadn't thought about this, but to try in one resolution that's awarding contracts to two different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| there's a problem about voting where you're making certain things applicable to only one of those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| I don't see it, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| The commissioner didn't bifurcate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| He's just merely saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| And the contract, by operation of law, is voidable if we find later there's an impropriety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| But he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| It's not as if we're sectioning out one of these two contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| And, Mr. King, I agree with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| We probably shouldn't split it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| And what I mean is if we find either party at some point guilty of something, we need to rebuild it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| But I'm referring particularly to this because this is the only pending litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| I think that the whole thing ought to be rebid because then we'll just have one that may not work for Shamrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| But I think we ought to rebid the whole thing because there may be other bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| There may be other bidders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| And I think that if we find if a party is found, you know, liable or they're found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| I'm not sure what the proper term is in a civil case because this is a civil and not a criminal case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| It's not a guilty or not guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| But if the plaintiff is or is found in favor of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| They just prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Or they prevail, then we ought to rebid the whole contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| The only thing I would say in response to that is lawyers live a lifetime trying to deal with the what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:39| And it's always better to deal with the facts as you know them when you take an action as to take action on what if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| and what we're doing or what's being proposed here is a what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| I suggest to you that the better thing to do is if something like that occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| you make your decision at that time and not in advance of the occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| It's the equivalent of dealing with a hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| That's my suggestion in all due respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| I think the motion that was made originally for approval of the contracts for the second is the appropriate one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| rather than the proposed substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Yes, we have another individual that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Would you like to give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| No, I'm the gentleman over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Yes, my name is Randy Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I live at 3901 Topside Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| I'm the owner of Shamrock Products, the other bidder in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| And Mr. King chose very eloquently to go down memory lane with you a little bit about the proposed mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| And for those commissioners who weren't seated when there were 19 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| I'll toss this little reminder at you and the rest of you as well that there was a significant amount of money that was due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| And people at the time thought it was some $300,000 associated with revenue share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| And I asked the commission to do an audit of the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| and everything that went on before you agreed to enter into the mediated settlement agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| because you not only were forgiving the $300,000, you were forgiving all claims known and unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| A little bit later you decided to do the audit after the mediated settlement was given and the releases were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| And you found out that, in fact, the number was half a million dollars and not $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| Well, surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Some of you expressed outrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Mr. Chalice expressed outrage in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| But nothing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| So I'll remind you that when that mediated settlement agreement was gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| the idea was that they owed Knox County taxpayers a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| And their quid pro quo to you to get them to release them from paying that money was we won't sue you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:45| And the claims that they brought forth that they said they could bring against Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| in litigation aggregated $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| And Judge Weaver, not me, but Judge Weaver, described these claims as spurious and illusory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| So it's not a far step to know that you gave up nothing and gave away a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| And now here we are today, and it's time to give them a new contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| allow them to continue to work for the Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| And in reference to what Mr. Brown said, you know, fool me once, that's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| But fool me twice, shame on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| Well, here they go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Because there's another lawsuit out there that everyone seems to forget about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| And that lawsuit is Diana Popp versus Natural Resources and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| You are a co-defendant with them in that litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| And the protection that the law department gave you in that matter was that you would get an indemnity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| from Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee, that they would cover your legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| And if you were found guilty, they would pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Well, if you'll pay attention, you'll notice that the company bidding on the new contract today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| is not Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| It's Nature's Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| It's a new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I dare say, and I speculate, but probably not without foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| that the old company is now a non-operating entity with no assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| I'm sure that because they've been in a wash in lawsuits from a key TAM plaintiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| and in this environmental case that their lawyers have tried to make an effort to make them judgment-proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| Well, that leaves Knox County out in the cold if, in fact, Diana Popp wins this lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| and if, in fact, you run up a bunch of legal fees trying to defend yourself in this lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| because it's out there and it's active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| It's on the Knox Circuit Court docket today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| And it's due to come to trial next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| So when you say they're going to save you a bunch of money, Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| the real cost of doing business with Natural Resources is more like the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| They didn't pay you half a million dollars and you gave up all rights blindly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| when you said they don't have to pay you half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| because you only thought you were giving up $300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| which you shouldn't have given up in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| because the claims that were the quid pro quo were ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| Next, you're sitting here with an indemnification from a non-operating entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| that who knows what kind of condition it's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| but you're willing to let these people eviscerate your indemnity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and not protect the taxpayers against a very real lawsuit that's imminent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| And I ask that this commission slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| And instead of making the same kind of quick judgment that you made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| on that mediated settlement agreement, that you slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| and you say, I'm going to protect the taxpayer this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Don't let them fool you twice, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Make sure that your indemnity in the POP lawsuit is still good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| and that you don't sit here in another year and find yourself going, oh, my gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| our indemnity for legal fee reimbursement and for a claim if you are found guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| and that entity is judgment proof, you'll probably pick up their share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I ask that you slow down and make sure that they don't sting you again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| sting the taxpayer one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| And if you do choose to do business with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| I dare say that in your non-governmental roles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| if you were doing business and someone owed you a whole bunch of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and didn't pay you, you probably wouldn't take their phone call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| And if somebody threatened to sue you with claims that a chancery judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| in Knoxville, Tennessee, described as illusory and spurious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| I doubt if you'd take their phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| But here you are ready to do business with them again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| because you think it's going to save you a whole bunch of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| But I purport to you that the real cost of doing business with them is a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| Do you remember when Mr. King said that his client hadn't had a chance to defend himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| against this key town claim and they hadn't had their day in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Well, guess what, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| There were three or four days before Judge Weaver where you paid Dean Farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to make that lawsuit go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| And there was lots of proof put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Bruce Weaver got on the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Tom Salter got on the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| There were tons of people that got on the stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Mr. Greaves, your time is about up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| Could you wrap it up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| So you paid hundreds of thousands of dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| You paid $100,000 or more to Pam Reeves to do an investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| and she didn't have the ability to put anybody under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| So it really didn't have a lot of teeth to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| So I ask you to consider what the real cost of doing business with them is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| It's been half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| and then it's been $100,000 for Dean Farmer, $100,000 for Pam Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| And then you've got this POP lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Make sure that the obligation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| And as a final comment, I'll say this to simplify matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| If you choose to do business with Natural Resources or Sid Bryan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| or whatever they're calling themselves now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| I respectfully submit that you can award the entire contract to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| And if you don't want to do business with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| I stand ready to do a fine job for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| the same way I've done for the city of Knoxville for the last 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Next speaker, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| My name is Bradley Mays, 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| I'm another litigant, in addition to the POPs, that has sued Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| I sued them to make them pay you money that was owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| when I thought they were financially abusing this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| The same parties that's talked to you now, talked to you then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| and told you that my claims were foolish and untrue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| tried to make me look like a liar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| There was even e-mails sent that I refrained from sending that weren't from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| They were sent from a county computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| But when we got in front of the judge, the judge reviewed the evidence, and it was severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| He said the claims were very strong against this contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| and you gave away your right for this money for nothing in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Subsequently, your engineering director is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| The thing that worries me currently is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| They've changed business names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| What happens if I go to court and win you all a million-dollar judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| and Natural Resources of Tennessee LLC owes you the million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| This is a new name they've came up with, a new corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| and you're going to be stuck doing business with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| and they can walk off and bankrupt the other one and just tell you all to take a hike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| And there is no reason to open another corporation that I can foresee in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| except for they plan on screwing you out of the settlement on the first corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| from the first eight years of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Why else do they need to change company names except to avoid paying you in case I win?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| The thing that you need to realize here is you all have the right to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| You all are the taxpayer's protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| And if you let them slip through with this, you're giving us no protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| That's what's upset me for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| The taxpayer's received no protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| When your engineering department knew about these zoo invoices, knew about Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| they told you there was nothing wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| and told you to pass a blanket forgiveness of claims known and unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| and never told you about those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| And according to the recent audit, they knew about them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| They came here and promised you the mulch wasn't contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| And we later found out that they lied to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| Why would you let a department straight lie to your face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| and continue to believe what they say and pass these amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| We are leaving the taxpayer here on the hook for the pop litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| We're leaving the taxpayer on the hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| If I win a million-dollar judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| they can keep on doing business with Knox County and bankrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| and not pay you one red cent of the money they took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| That a judge has said the claims were strong, severe, and real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| There's no reason in the world you should allow this company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| to just simply change business names, do business with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| and not have some sort of mechanism here to be able to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| I don't think they should bid at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| With a judgment as strong as we've got so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I don't think they should have been allowed to bid at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| The stewardship of this entire program has failed the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| When we sold Solway, we had $4 million invested into that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| Commissioner Norman asked that MPC evaluate if it would bring more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| if we zoned it industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| Everybody was told the decision was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| We later found out MPC had been cut completely out of the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| They put it up for auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| They auctioned it on two weeks' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Nobody could get financed, nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| Selling a $4 million asset on two weeks' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| And, of course, they had their money lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| They purchased it for $2 million, 50 cents on the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| That's good stewardship of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| And we're fixing to do another one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| You're fixing to let them open another LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| and the only purpose of this new LLC is to protect them against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| Knox County having a claim against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| The only purpose of having this new LLC is they're afraid they might owe you money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| and they don't want to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| And you want to go ahead and sign up with a new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| There's no reason to change their name that I can foresee other than to avoid paying you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| with the first contract and the first corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| It's inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| I almost had a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I forgot what my false word was when we started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| It almost falls under that you can't make this stuff up because there's so many variables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| and accusations and claims and counterclaims in this deal or all of these deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| I hadn't read all the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| I still haven't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| I read the waste audit several times this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| I read the Pam Rees report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| I did not read at length the Judge Weaver's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| And it does appear to me that people are saying this $311,000 is basically a hearsay number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| Pam Rees' report, she says it's, she quotes the Matthews grinding bill, which was, I think, $27,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:09| and the defendants withholding the $311,000 revenue sharing owed to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| And that was, some of that was at the looking, at the approval of Mr. Evans, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:22| And regrettably, of course, he's not here, and it's easy to kick around somebody that's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| But it appears to me there was a huge amount, hundreds of thousands of dollars that were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| that was not paid to the county that should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| And I won't even go into all the zoodoo and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Many of those were our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Many of those were the, not the county's fault for not, our employees said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| don't worry about this or don't worry about that, don't worry about the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| And I guess the only thing NRRT said don't worry about was putting in the CPI rider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| which maybe saved us a few thousand bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| But what puts us behind the eight ball, to me, is that we got two bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| And they're, one's $2880 and the other's $1440.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| I mean, if you look at a truck, what's a truck carry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| I mean, at least ten tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| If we go with the $28, every truckload is going to be a difference of $140 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| And it's going to be, I would think, thousands of those things throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| I mean, we're talking about big money and only getting two bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| It's a great dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Obviously, once there was, it looks like NRRT or whatever they're called now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| and there's a resource recovery, intentionally cut Mr. Greaves' bid in half just for some reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| I guess to show how cheap they were going to do it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| And they formerly did it at $23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Now they're going to do it at $1440.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| But there's hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake going forward as I view this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| If we go with the $28, Mr. Greaves' inner city exclusively, like these guys or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:08| they're crooks whether they're crooks or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I mean, all the innuendos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| But we're costing the taxpayers going forward hundreds of thousands of dollars more, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:22| if we go exclusively with the Mr. Greaves' Zaler Avenue facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| I just don't see a $14 versus a $28, how in good conscience I can vote to give exclusivity to the inner city location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:39| just simply because of the substantial numbers difference and the hit to our bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| I was trying to read the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| What's the term of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| It's an annual-based contract, I think, up to five years, renewed on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| The contract also includes a 30-day with or without cause termination verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| So we can, with or without cause in 30 days, we can get out of this either agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| Either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| If something does come up in six months or a year, we can pull out in 30 days notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| You know, I second Commissioner Briggs' motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| simply because I wanted to hear the conversation about what our options are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| if something really egregious comes back from those court proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| It wasn't necessarily support for it, but it was my desire to hear that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| You know, just to give folks, I know we talk a lot about commissioners that weren't sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| commissioners that were sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| I guess I was a commissioner that was sitting for a large part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| One thing I need folks to understand from my novice view of this whole thing from day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:16| how can you put a dollar value on showing up one morning and your retention pond is gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| No more water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| How do you get your arms around what that costs you in terms of your business and your business model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| And, you know, regardless what lawyer or judge or whatever looked at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| if you're in the business of dealing with poo, whether it's from the zoo or wherever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| you need environmental protection measures in place, and they have to be secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| They have to be secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Are you going to lose your license, your shirt, counter shirt, and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| So when things like that started to happen, you know, we can argue up and down about the integrity of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| and their deeds and whatnot, but I think Commissioner Shouse hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| A lot of this was our own doing or undoing, and we have to just own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| You know, we can continue to dig folks up and give them 30 lashes and bury them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| That's really what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| I mean, I've heard Mr. Evans' name invoked hundreds of times over this last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| both publicly and in our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| It is what it is, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| We did what we did during that time, and we, you know, turned a blind eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| We called it even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| We did a, you know, yeah, we can not pay this because we did this or didn't submit this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| We can do that as long as the day is long, but when I look at this, we have two bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| These bids are drastically different, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| We'd be crazy not to entertain a bid of $14 with no pallet fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:22| That's what we're talking about, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| We do a lot of talk about fiscal conservatism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Can they handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| I don't think anyone's argued about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| You can argue about the people in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Can they handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Is it convenient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Yeah, it's pretty darn convenient for a huge part of us, of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| So, you know, I think when you gel everything together, and I know there's strong arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| and there's probably some validity to them, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| I don't know these individuals, but I do know some of the things we've dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| in reading the report, listening to folks, but, you know, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| that whole thing was messy on both sides, extremely messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| And what I'm trying to do, hopefully, we'll get out of that mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| But putting someone out of business because it was messy on both sides is not something I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| So, you know, I'll vote how I vote, but I'm definitely in favor of this contract going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:22| And with what Mr. Holt just said, I mean, if they're guilty, we can void the contract in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| So that's something that's always at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Yeah, I just had a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| Let's be real clear what we're voting on and what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| I'm voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| This isn't going to make a lot of people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I'm voting for the contract to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| And I agree what Commissioner Schaus said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| I agree with what, you know, really what everyone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| This is a good deal for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| I'm a little curious as to why in 2002 that $14 wasn't enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| and $23 was what the contract called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| And it wasn't the contract, by the way, just to make it straight, is that the contract wasn't per load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| It was $23 per ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| And we were supposed to have gotten $1.50, you know, per scoop when they put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| So this wasn't a load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| This dealt with per ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| But to any extent, my resolution, just so it's clear because we're starting to discuss something that's not on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| my resolution isn't whether we should approve or disapprove the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| My resolution is that we approve the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| But if, and I'm going to use these terms, and I'm putting some words in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| if natural resources recovery is found guilty of basically committing fraud against the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| or not living up to their contract and not paying us the money we owe, all the contract is void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| and then we go back and re-bid the whole thing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| So I think what we're doing, it's a bit of a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| but what we're doing is we're letting the contract go forward where NRR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| I'm going to call them what they are, gets part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| They'll be getting part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| They will be getting part of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| But after everybody has their day in court, and I agree with Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| is that the plaintiffs in this did not have the or the defendants in this have not had their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| They did not, you know, they've not been able to present their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| We'll let the courts decide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| This may still take another year, year and a half, two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| What I'm saying is that, and it doesn't depend, to get with what Mr. May says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| it doesn't depend what the name of the company is now, is that this contract with the county will be void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| and then we can look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| I would rather go ahead and just kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| We put it out for re-bid because then everybody's had their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| Both sides have presented their cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| If you believe in the judiciary system, which we would believe would be fair to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| is that we'll let them decide this because they're going to hear every bit of the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| not some of the commissioners that were here, some that weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| And it is a very complex and messy case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| But if they find that this company has defrauded us, then we'll put the contract out for bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| And we will let it go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| We are looking in the interest of the taxpayers by having this very, very low bid go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:21| But if we're found out that this particular company are the same, it's going to be the same officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| the same owners of the company, did us wrong, then we're going to start all over from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| and then we'll decide whether we want them to bid or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| And I hope that this satisfies no one, but it does protect the taxpayers in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| It lets the low bid go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| It puts it in the hands of the court where both sides, you know, we don't really want to be judge and jury on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| But if there is found to be an injustice against the county, then that will stop it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| And that's the motion on the floor right now, not whether to approve the contract or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| but to approve the contract with those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| If you gentlemen would like to speak, I'll give you two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| In response to Commissioner Schaus, an average load is more like two tons, not ten tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| And the actual county volumes that you would be, Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| is probably around 3,000 or 4,000 tons a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| The bulk of the volumes that was passing through Solway, I believe, came from Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| and from individual residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| So you're not talking about anywhere near the kind of money that you're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| Yes, sir, you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| I was going to make a similar statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| According to a letter sent from this law firm in October of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| the county's portion of the green waste was averaging about 2,000 tons a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| He highlighted it out for several years, Mr. David Draper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| an attorney that works for Lewis King and Walthrop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| So if the portion that actually came from the county was 2,000 tons a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| and let's say they receive half, that's about 1,000 tons a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| So you're going to save 14,000 tons a year or dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| That's your savings, 14 grand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| I believe it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| It's not a huge volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| And the other thing that I wanted to point out is that if, well, can I, I'll save my last 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:18| Yes, Mr. King, you have two minutes if you'd like to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Do I get to speak after he gets his last 45 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| I'd rather get it over with so I can try to respond in my final year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| I don't mind going now, but I may want 45 seconds to deal with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| I'll give you that courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Two, three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| On this issue of the savings, in addition to the amount per ton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| the savings that the county was calculating and working on involves more than just the difference in the tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4723)|
| 1:18:52| It involves the time, fuel, et cetera, in going from one location as opposed to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4732)|
| 1:19:00| So the savings is more and is potentially and will be more than just the tonnage tipping fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:09| And that's the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| They wanted more than one vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| They can speak for themselves, but that's at least my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| I hear what you're saying, Dr. Briggs, and I know what your intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| It's rather clearly expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| I did not want this body to go forward under any illusion, however, so I'm going to make one point about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| You are dealing with different corporate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| They are different legal entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| There is an issue as to whether you can take the actions or asserted actions of one entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| and apply it to another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| I'll just say that and I'll leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| On the issue by Mr. Mays about auctioning off this property on two weeks' notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:04| I dare say most folks, and certainly him included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| were well aware this property was going to be auctioned off 45 days before it was ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| It was the subject of much discussion and debate over a series of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| as to how the property was going to be sold, which was the best way to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| Contract was entered into with the auctioneer, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| There was ample notice that the property was going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| It was noticed enough that he showed up and bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| And if, indeed, it was worth $4 million and we bid two and got it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:51| if it's worth that four that he's talking about that you all took it on the chin, he had the right to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| as did about, I don't know, a hundred other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| Mr. King, if you could wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| In any event, it sold for considerably more than the appraisals this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| or this county got of the property before they sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| They'd had an appraisal conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| They had that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| And the price it brought at sale was more than that appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| You have one minute, sir, Mr. Mays, and then we're going to hear from our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| I would just say that I've read that appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| You all had ten acres of concrete, a $200,000 set of truck scales, log cabin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| everything else built out there, and it appraised for like $100,000 for all the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| Nobody can get approved on a loan over $500,000 in less than 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| and he just said it was sold on a 45-days notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| You know, borrowing the money, what your property brought was basically who could borrow the most amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| in the least amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| The third point I wanted to make is he made it very clear to you all that this is a different legal entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| And if we catch these same people and I prove what we've proven time and time again in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| if we prove these allegations are to be true and we get a verdict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| you're going to have a hard time doing anything to the new company name over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| If you don't put something hard into this resolution through the form of an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| you're going to have a hard time taking corrective action against this new corporate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| And that's why you need to put something into this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| Mr. King, we'll give you the courtesy of one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order here, is that when we have the school board chairman come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| and want to speak, we don't let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| But, yeah, we're letting these people talk back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| They're supposed to have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| I thought those were the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| The rules are being enforced against the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| I mean, I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| This can go on all day with arguments between Mr. Mays and Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| I mean, I think at some point we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| I mean, what are the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Well, if we want to shut down the discussion, we can do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| We've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| I was going to say that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| We can go all day long backwards and forwards between the two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| I don't want to hash out the selling of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| We hashed that out back in August and July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| We decided it was appraised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| We sold it for $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| We agreed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| We're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| So that's over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| What concerns me about this, and I apologize for my absence last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| but what concerns me is the changing of the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| I don't have a problem with the new bid for the new company name and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| But what concerns me about it is if it's said in a court that they owe X amount of dollars, NRR, to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5030)|
| 1:24:03| there's nothing to keep them from going bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| And if they go bankrupt, then we're out that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| We won't get it back because you will not be able to tie them to that new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| And we just will lose that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| That's the only thing that concerns me is why the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| If it's not a big deal, it should have been submitted under the same name instead of creating a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| So that's the only thing that concerns me about this, this low bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| I mean, it's attractive and it's good, and I hope that it would work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| But, I mean, it concerns me that of having two vendors, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| Also, it's nice to have the competition, but I wish the numbers were a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| Was it stated that the original bid was $23?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| In 2002, it was $23 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| That's another thing that kind of brings a red flag for me, why it would drop that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| But, I mean, that's their business that they run it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| But I have concerns about this name change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| and losing any financial that needs to come back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| And I asked this during the whole decision when we decided to sell the two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| I asked, did NRR owe us any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| Was there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| I was told, no, everything's been paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| And now I find that there's still lawsuits out there saying that it's up to half a million dollars, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| that they owe the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| That concerns me that I was told there wasn't owed anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| and now they're finding out that there could possibly be a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| But I'm just the name change really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Mr. Graves, could you come back to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| Mr. Mays, you might want to be just close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I may have a quick question if he doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| While these guys are coming down here, one thing that he brought up that I thought was a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| talking about this sale that we had, you know, it was fine to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| Let me tell you, to do that kind of money, do that kind of loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| if it was to bring two to four million dollars, it's going to take a lot longer than 45 days to get approved at the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| If you've tried to buy any commercial property lately, the banks have been extremely stringent on what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| It would take you three or four months to get something like that approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| So I agree with that statement that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| The question that I've got or the concern that I've got with what Dr. Briggs is coming up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| I understand that completely and I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| But, Randy, the way I see it is, all right, if we do this with what we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| that these guys get in trouble, then we can cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| Well, don't you feel that if these guys get in trouble, they're going to delay it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| delay it as long as they can in court and it could go on for another two to three years before they're ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| But, Mr. Mays, you've had some experience with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| What's your opinion, Randy, if this thing ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| I'm not a lawyer, but when you all were considering whether or not to extend their contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| or the mediated settlement agreement, you said, well, we'll just let the courts handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Well, it still hasn't come to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| It's nothing but motions to delay, motions to delay, motions to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| And I don't even know when it's scheduled to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| So this will just go on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I mean, it's a great thing for Mr. King's law firm, but it's not a very good thing for the Knox County taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| As far as saving money, the amount of money you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| I'm sure the devil would make a really attractive offer for any of your souls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| But I ask that you very carefully consider, you know, what's your integrity worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| and who do you want to do business with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| And that's where I'm at with this, too, Mr. Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| I'm glad you mentioned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| You know, you're saying that your estimation, you guys, you think it's going to save ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| the difference is about $14,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Is that what you all come up with, the difference of $14,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| You know, gentlemen, ladies, I'm a businessman myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| I sell insurance policy, and it's just a bold-faced lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| Then I turn around, and next year I change the name of my company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| So it's still the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Guys, if we vote for this, we've got our heads in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| They have screwed us before, and they're going to try to do it to us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| And I don't know who said it, but we owe it to the taxpayers for $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| We don't need to do business with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| We have our integrity, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| That's only on the tonnage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| That doesn't include man hours, vehicles, gas, and all the other stuff, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| Plus the fact that we've got 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Any time we get ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| I just wanted to hear what he had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| This issue is ---- and I've been here for the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| It's so unbelievably complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| I don't know how we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| I tend to agree with Mr. McKenzie that there's mistakes all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| We've got to own up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| We cannot solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| It's a lawyer's heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| It's our purgatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| I don't know how to get out of it other than allow the judicial process to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| I agree with Dr. Briggs about, you know, what if this company is found fraudulent at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| and we're doing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Well, I mean, they're tainted and we shouldn't be doing business with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| But we've got that solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| So we can void the contract in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| I mean, I just don't see any other way to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| Who knows what with all the stuff that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| I just cannot get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| So, I mean, I agree with Rick in many ways on his points, but I just cannot, I can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5407)|
| 1:30:20| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Just, you know, one thing that I have a problem with, and I'll be honest with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| I have a problem with this department telling us if we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| They've been in charge of this for years and we've been misled on a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| It seems to be a cover-up on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| I'm not so sure that we would be told that we're having a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| that we would know to pull the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| That's, you know, that's a major concern that I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| It seems like, well, there, there, it's okay, we're going to let this pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| Let me tell you, when Mr. Mays is through with his stuff, folks, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| we've been hearing about it and hearing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| The man knows what he's talking about, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| And then we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| We've been looking in the rearview mirror for about an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| or however long we've been looking in the rearview mirror about things that have gone on the entire time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| that I have sat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| What we have before us today is a resolution about where we can go take green waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| and have three places to dump and at various prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| And it's up to Dwight Vandivate, I'll call him by name, to do his best job to make sure we get the best value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:30| for the taxpayers' money about hauling green waste to one of three places at two different prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| That's all that's before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| Cancellation of the contracts in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| If we have a problem with anything, we can take care of it in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| The thing that I kind of see in the amendment would be that the entire contract would be thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:55| That would leave us with no vendor to go to until we could get a new contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| So the resolution as presented to us is what I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| The motion on the floor is a substitute motion, which would approve the contract subsequent to the court ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| And depending on the court ruling, the contract would be void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5536)|

| 1:34:21| Clerk, if you would read the next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| The next item is Resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| It's approving the provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated Section 68-211-701 through 704| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| and 707, also known as the Jackson Law, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Mr. Vandevee, would you just kind of brief us on this and exactly the ramifications of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5686)|

| 1:34:50| As mentioned last week, the Jackson Law is a local option statute that if you pass by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| two-thirds majority gives you broader oversight over the placement of landfills within Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Absent adopting the Jackson Law, if TDEC permits a landfill and the applicant meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| all other conventional zoning requirements, then that landfill would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| If you pass the Jackson Law, it affords you much broader oversight and authority, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| the right to turn one down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| And I actually sent you a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| There's a Section 704 that if you get a chance to look at, it gives you very broad authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| If you just think it's inconsistent with the neighborhood, if you think it could negatively impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| property values or otherwise have negative implications, this body would have the right to turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| down, even if it met other zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| So this needs to be approved by two-thirds vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| We would encourage your approval of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I appreciated Commissioner McKenzie's question, but it really just gives you concurrent permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| authority, along with TDEC, that goes above and beyond what the zoning ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| It gives you very broad authority and also creates procedural steps so that if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| has concerns about a landfill, there are public notice and public hearing requirements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| would have to be met and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Mr. Jarrett, just for clarification, a two-thirds vote is how many votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| You have ten present, and you'll need seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| We don't go by the 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Let me back up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| I thought we always went by the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Nevertheless, my point was it's still seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| It's what I was trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| It's still seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Regardless of the higher math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Now I've lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| The math problems always get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| The question I was going to ask is that I've seen quite a bit of writing about this, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| and the other e-mails and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| This is not a question about the technicality of doing this, but if we become equal partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| with the state and the state approves or TDEC or whoever you want to say this permitting authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5815)|
| 1:37:04| is right now, and we disagree with them, the county's position is what's going to prevail, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:14| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| You would have the ultimate right of refusal even if somebody was permitted through TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| and even if they met all the requirements of the zoning ordinance as published, you would still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| and, again, if you get a chance to look at it, that paragraph 704 of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| Shelby sent that out to you last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Details of the conditions under which you could opt to turn down a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| And, again, they are very broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| It has to do with property values, inconsistency with the character of the area, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| I guess where I'm headed to with the question, though, would be so this is the situation that we come upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| and we've had public hearings and we've gone with whatever we think to be the appropriate course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| But if State of Tennessee has said that all the requirements for permitting have been met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| does that mean then the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| What's the outcome of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Would the property owner take county commission to court over its decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| And I'm in favor of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| I'm just trying to see what might be down the road or around the bend if this were to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| Hypothetically, if TDEC approved it and this commission declined it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| we are not going to issue grading, building, or construction permits on that basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| And so, subsequently, I suppose somebody could take you to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| But our office won't permit any activity for grading, construction, or building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| or anything of that nature if this commission has turned it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| But you do see my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| What would be the property owner's next avenue of whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| And it would be then to court, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I assume it would be chancellery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Commissioner Burroughs has asked that she be allowed to participate in the discussion on the pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| Without objection, we'll move on to number 803 and come back to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Or 802, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| 802 is on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| It is regarding the issuance of not to exceed $14,400,000 general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:19| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| Yes, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| I guess Joe or John's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| These are new bonds, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| This one and 802 and 803 are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| 802 and 803 go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| They're the new money, and that's exactly what was approved and anticipated to be issued through the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:41| And so what we're asking for is permission to put that out for bid and a competitive sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| I have a question on 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| So a motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| 803 is the resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| $14,400,000 of Knox County, Tennessee, making provision for the issuance, sale, and payment of said bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:13| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of principal of premium, if any, and interest on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Commissioner Schaus, do you have a question on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Mr. Mayor, did you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| I need to request to speak out of order on the previous resolution dealing with the pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:41| I have a lot of people back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| We have some other meetings to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I was wondering, do we know when Commissioner Broyles is expected to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| We didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| She was waiting on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| We were just going to go ahead and take a couple of other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| And if she's not here, we're moving right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Motion is made to approve and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| H6, resolution 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| It's number one, authorizing the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| and the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $23,500,000, making provisions for the issuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:24| sale, and payment of said bonds, establishing the terms thereof and the disposition of proceeds therefrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of principal of premium, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| and interest on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| And number two, in connection with the county series 6-A-1 loan agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| and series 6-K-1 loan agreement and series D-3-A loan agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| and the related public building authority bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| authorizing the conversion of the interest rate period to the index rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| and approving certain amendments and the form of execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| and delivery of documents in connection therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| John, come and define a couple of these things for me, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| As I told you this morning at the pension meeting, I did have my, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| your municipal finance one-on-one that you gave us back six months or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| Well, let me just start with a little bit of background, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| One piece of this is to refund series 2003, and that's a little bit better than $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:34| And our expectation is that we would save about $1 million in interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| and that's a fixed rate for a fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| And in round numbers, about half of that would be for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| and about half of that would be for general county savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| So we do that one refunding, and we get, in round numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| about $1 million in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| Part B to this resolution is related to 2004, 2005, and 2007 variable rate bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6173)|
| 1:43:03| that are already outstanding, and we're talking about improving or doing two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Improving how they work from a standby bond purchase agreement into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:15| it's like a private placement, and also to save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| So each of these steps will save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| And then, okay, now I'm ready to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| The 23-5 million you're refunding, that stuff matures half roughly in April of 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:40| another half April of 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| It's short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| It's relatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| But you're dropping it from five to one and a half or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| That's how you're saving all the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| And so we're capturing those savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| Part of that is that it will be a current refunding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| and so we're able to do that January 1st, and we want to capture what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| And the variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| Why are we doing three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Why are we not doing all five of the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| Three of them have one provider that we know that we want to exchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| and we're going to improve those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| The other ones I think we can take a look at and monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| but we really were after just improving those three because we knew we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| change those because the liquidity provider is getting out of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| and we knew that our time period was limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| and so that was our focus of our energies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| The first one, the 6-1-29, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:48| That provider is 67.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| That provider is BB&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| They're solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| They're with us, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| The V-1-K-1, V-I-K-1 are 69 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| That's a problem maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| That's 69 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| That's a DEPFA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| And then the 71-5, that's a DEPFA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Those two of the three are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| And then the other two that you left alone are BB&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| So I guess we'll just the first one, the BB&T, one of them is already material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:29| No, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| The BB&T re-upped it, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| Their letter of credit expired June 30, and they re-upped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| June 30, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| And so we're in good shape with them for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| I guess my question is why, well, you told me, although BB&T is on here, who's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| and two of the DEPFAs who is wanting out of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| Is that right, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Correct, Commissioner Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| And we need them out of the business, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| As you correctly mentioned, you've got five outstanding variable rate loan agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| Three of them were converted to BB&T back in 2009, and then they extended those recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| The DEPFA Bank has indicated they will not extend, and we have the opportunity to actually lower the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| in connection with those going to the index mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| So we're not only lowering costs on the outstanding variable rate debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| but we're extending the terms out to four to five years versus the DEPFA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| which was going to expire next year in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| Because we got such good proposals back from the three banks that I spoke about last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| U.S. Bank, PNC, and JPMorgan Chase, we wanted to have the opportunity on one of the BB&Ts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| to look at bringing in JPMorgan Chase, which was kind of the third bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| if it looks like it makes more sense than just staying with BB&T for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| That would be, as far as big banks go, that's a blue chipper for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| What does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| I still don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| And it's in the to convert the interest rate period to the index rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| I'm sure it's simple, but I just don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Yeah, currently the bonds are out trading in what we call a variable rate demand market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| where the interest rate is reset on a daily or weekly basis based on where money market funds are buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| high-quality floating rate taxes in paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Going to the index rate would be that one of these three banks would agree to buy those bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| as Mr. Troyer just said, and bring them in-house on the balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| And then the rate would reset based on the agreed-upon index, which would either be LIBOR or SIFMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| which is the high-quality tax-exempt indices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| So a JPMorgan or a BB&T or a U.S. Bank would take those into their portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| They wouldn't be floating out there in money funds and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| They'd buy them into their own balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| And then the rate would just be set based on the index that's out there on, like, a weekly or monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| That would also insulate the county from some of the volatility that's out there in the money market funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| And it also insulates the county from any volatility that one of the banks may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| because they are the owner of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| So while you want your partners to be healthy, you wouldn't be subject to any disruption that they may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| from their own business line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| So, and those things would last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| Up to five years, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| And these things, something else to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| Am I correct on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| The maturities are 2029, 2034.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| Those are the final maturities on each of the loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| So we've still got a problem even after these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Well, it's not necessarily a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| I shouldn't say problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| Yeah, in the variable rate market, you always have expiration dates on your credit facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| whether it's a standby bond purchase agreement or a letter of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| And so you try to have those staggered out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| And then from time to time, you renegotiate with either your existing provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| or you bring in a new provider to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| So that's always an ongoing maintenance issue with outstanding variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| In exchange for that, you get extremely low cost of funds versus the fixed rate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| It's very low cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| John and I kicked this around some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| What is --can we unwind these things sooner or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| I mean, it still worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| The word swap, I think it's Jefferson County, Alabama and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| The county always has the option to terminate any of its interest rate swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| The question is, where is the market value at the point that you want to terminate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| Currently, all your interest rate swaps are performing extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| You're receiving back a lot more than you're paying out on the underlying variable rate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| So the hedges are working very effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| If you want to terminate, then it depends on where the market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| And you'll either have to pay to terminate or you could receive a payment to terminate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| depending upon where market rates are at the time of the termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| So, okay, so you just look at the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| But it is the possibility is there to unwind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| And it still just scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Am I doing these numbers right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| We've got roughly 660 million outstanding and 310 are in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I mean, I would just run them at 310 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| Have underlying variable rate bonds, of which two-thirds of that are hedged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| This is probably the hedge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| They're listed on this thing John gave us, which I use up really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| It's in layman's terms, so I can understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| They're listed as VRDBs, variable rate debt bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| Variable rate demand bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| Demand bonds, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| And two of them, three of them are listed in parenthesis as swapped, and two of them say VR mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:50| Tell me what I'm talking about that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| They're unhedged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| They're in the variable rate mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| The three are swapped, meaning, in theory, we have hedging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| And two are just at the mercy of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Well, all the variable rate bonds are at the mercy of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| What you did with your interest rate swaps is you hedged the volatility in the variable rate market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| by entering into interest rate swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| And so, I assume you're looking at a presentation where differentiated between variable rate bonds that are hedged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:20| i.e., with interest rate swaps, and variable rate bonds that aren't hedged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| and so your true cost of money is variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| It doesn't take into account any of the hedge factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Okay, so we're at 37 and 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| So, about 110 of the VR and the REF 2290 are swapped, generally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| So, if you take your 110 that are unhedged, using your numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| and the actual variable rate in the market is 0.2 percent, and your credit cost is 0.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| and the county's true cost of money is 0.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| If you look at your hedge debt, and while the variable rate may be 0.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| you're paying a higher fixed rate to the counterparty under the hedge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| and receiving back a variable rate to help offset part of that fixed rate and part of the variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| So, the true cost of money may be more like a three or three and a quarter, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| So, one final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| The real problem, the real risk here would be if interest rates returned to 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:26| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| If they returned to, I mean, prime was 18, so tax-free, say it returned to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| Would that be the risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| In the late 70s, early 80s, high-quality tax-free variable rate bonds may have got up into the 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| and 8 percent range for a very, very short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| But as we talked about last Monday, that's one of the reasons why you have a diversified portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| Some traditional fixed rate bonds, which normally are your highest cost of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| Some unhedged variable rate bonds, which normally is your lowest cost of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| And then some hedged debt, which is somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| And then if you're unhedged debt, the variable rate started to rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| and that 15-year average is about 3 percent, 20-year average is about three and a quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| then the county trustee is going to be able to earn more on the asset side of your balance sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| through those investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| So, you've got some built-in hedges there on the asset side of your balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| If you were a county trustee, had $10 million to invest, and we still had $200 million in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| and tax-free went to 7, we'd have a huge debt service problem, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| I'm not speaking, I'm not saying doomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| I'm just speaking in hypotheticals, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| Right, but in hindsight, looking back, if the county only had $10 million of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| you probably would not have taken on as much variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| As you know, the county's fund balance, both general fund and debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| is very substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| It's way, way above $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| If you chose to drive, bring down the fund balance substantially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| then you probably want to look at changing the makeup of your debt portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I would just, and John and I, again, we don't want to put words in his mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| we talk kicking around casually about the swaps, and there are areas of concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| and I would hope we could address slowly, work our way out of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| Of course, the well-documented issues in Jefferson County, Alabama, that you're referencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| really had to do more with the municipal bankruptcy of the debt that they were ordered to mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| to put on by the courts for their sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| And then they did, they leveraged their debt and their interest rate swaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| so they had swaps that were well in excess of the amount of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| And so it was more of a bet, a risky bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| And then they didn't have the ability because of the, it was a revenue transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| They didn't have the ability to refinance the debt because there weren't sufficient sewer revenues to pay that debt off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| Here, as you guys know, you've got extremely strong credit rating, and this is general obligation-backed debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:55| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| And I don't mean to be projecting doomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| As you said, the sewer issue in Birmingham, and I referenced Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| I think that was tied to an incinerator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| So there are projects that have drug those things into bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| You explained it for me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| I didn't mean to tap so much time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| No, thank you, because I appreciate your asking those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| It was extremely helpful for me to understand, and I appreciate your ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| I don't know what questions to ask, so I appreciate the fact that you were asking those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| I need to recuse myself because I'm on the local board at BB&T Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Let's go back now to item number 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| It is a resolution amending the Knox County fiscal year 2011 through 2012 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| to appropriate $1,577,611.64 for the purpose of providing a 3% pay increase for budgeted Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:53| effective January 1, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| You know, I've talked a lot about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| I still feel the same way in that, you know, when we talk about value, we talk a lot about value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:18| We talk a lot about price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| We talk a lot about, you know, what we're standing on in our, you know, morals and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:29| And I just, it just, I have a hard time justifying a one-and-a-half percent raise over a four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:41| I had a hard time in July and well, the roll-up to July, and I still have a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| You know, Social Security is paid better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| We're talking about a four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| So everyone wants to talk about, well, don't complicate the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| It's not complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| One-and-a-half percent increase over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| That's all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| What I'm talking about is making that three percent over four years, less than one percent a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| So we can talk about the untangling and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| We can't go back to May and June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| There were valid reasons for not presenting that in May and June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| You know, there was some uncertainty, and I fully understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| As Commissioner Shouse, as the gentleman ended with, we always, well, we don't want to be like Birmingham, Jefferson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:44| We don't want to be like Harrisburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| We're not those entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| If you all remember, those of us that take water and sewer from KUB, our sewer bills were doubled over a 10-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:59| because that's how they handled that crisis called, you know, the government saying your sewers are not in very good shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:07| and you're overflowing and you're mixing waste and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| So let's not compare ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Let's look at where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Let's look at our financial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Let's look at our financial strength, and let's value, let's apply a value to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:24| Less than 1% over a 4-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| That's all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| That's all I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:30| Maybe I'm talking alone, but that's all I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| I'm talking about, as I said earlier, Commissioner Norman brought up a question over $750,000 for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:44| Half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| Poof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| We're talking about a million dollars in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Half of that is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| We're at $125,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| We're almost at that $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| I mean, you know, so in terms of, oh, no, the dollars aren't there, they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| We'll have to do some shuffling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| We may not be able to put as much toward the pay down as we all like and feel perfectly comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:15| But just think about the folks going home with an extra, after taxes, $19 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:25| Trying to make that $38 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| That's all I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| So I just said, you know, and hopefully over this last week, I asked, you know, I gave folks homework assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| Hopefully we all, I gave myself one as well, hopefully we all took me up on it and actually asked people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| even those that complain and say, no raise, no raise, no raise, ask them when's the last time they have a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| They've gotten a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| Ask them how have they dealt with this drastic increase over the last four years over a lot of common commodities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:56| and made your decision based on what's best for the overall good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| So, again, I just ask you all to consider strongly, sincerely, honestly consider this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| a substitute motion that I'm going to introduce that we make this 3% raise retroactive to July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:17| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| If not, motion dies for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| I believe that back at budget time I spoke to a need for a raise for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:40| And at that time I sided with the fact that there may not have been money at that time available for a raise for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:52| Last week I believe I brought that up again saying that I liked a raise for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| And at this time, first, I'd like to say that I appreciate Mayor Burchett's efforts in regards to coming up with funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:07| a raise for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| These are extraordinary times in which we're living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| I guess it's really unprecedented that maybe we, as Commissioner McKenzie has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| that we've gone this many years without some kind of action for county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:28| To the reverse side of that, we've really tightened belts, our belts at several occasions doing or trying to do more with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:38| But I'm now pleased to see that the administration is bringing forward a process by which county employees can get a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:50| However, I think that what I would like to present is that the 3% is sort of standard fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7310)|
| 2:02:00| And I'd like for us to think for just a moment outside the box and how the money that we have now on the table might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:08| in my opinion, more equitably distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| And what I propose is splitting the dollar amount available for pay raises amongst all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:19| Rather than using that traditional percentage arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| And I ask that you, as my fellow commissioners, support this or at least talk with me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| After all, a gallon of gas or a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk is the same for any employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:41| Whether they're making $35,921 or whether they're making $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:49| Now, the reason I used the $35,921, I believe that to be the person that's in the middle on the pay roll in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7369)|
| 2:03:02| If you take the total number of employees and you start at the top and you start at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| and you knock them off one at a time going from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| In other words, it's the mean, not the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| That means that the person in Knox County that's right in the middle of the pay rolls making $35,921,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| then on a per year basis their raise would be $1,077 on a per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:30| But we have other employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| In fact, half of the employees of Knox County are below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| Take, for example, the $25,000-a-year employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| The annual raise would be $750, whereas the employee at $100,000 annual pay would be getting a $3,000 raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:55| I'd like for us to consider that and talk about it for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| And really, I would offer a substitute motion that instead of a 3% raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| my substitute motion would be that the money now found available for employee raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:10| be distributed for that second half of this physical year on a per-monthly basis equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:22| I guess if you want, well, I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| Question for you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| When you say equal, are we talking about the $1.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| We have six months, and so that $1.5, you divide that by six, and whatever that money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| I mean, I'm trying to get a feel for what you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| And I'm glad to discuss it because sometimes my words may not come out as my thoughts would have them be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:51| But, yes, that is what I'm proposing, that across the board, for all the employees in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| that are covered by this particular 3% raise, the 3%, which would be $3,000 for a $100,000-a-year employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7497)|
| 2:05:09| or only $750 for a $25,000-a-year employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:15| Now, that's on a per-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| And you see we're only talking about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| So that $750 would only be half of that because we're only talking about three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:27| Did I answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Substitute motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| I can't remember where that came from, but just forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Is this a bonus or a pay raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| This is a pay raise, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| And so this would be something that would be what percentage does that work out for a $20,000 or $25,000 employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| I'm just offering the facts and figures of a 3% raise versus an across-the-board raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7556)|
| 2:06:04| And let me back up and say I did leave a sentence off of my where I started was, even back at budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:15| what we were wanting to do was help those people that were the truck drivers and convenience center workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:23| and people that are out here doing the legs and feet of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| And that's where I want to end up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| This is a one-time deal, but it is a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| And if we need to go to a raise that is percentage-wise at some later date, then that's quite possible also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7596)|
| 2:06:44| All that's been presented to us is a pay raise for a six-month period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| and continuing on after that, provided it's in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| But you do see the 3% is $3,000 at the top end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:59| and significantly smaller for the same gallon of gas, same loaf of bread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| same person that we're trying to help that's at a lower scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| Sounds like the commissioners are going to get a nice pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| That's another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| And that's another question that needs to be brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| Let's pause there for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| I have not really investigated the line items of this particular matrix that's an addendum to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:29| Is the code for commission included in any of this raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:36| We're Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Yes, the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| I'm not saying that I have asked anyone, but I need to make sure of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| because I did not know that the commissioners were included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| And if that is a question, then I'll address that when we have more time to talk in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| Are the school board members, Francis, also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Francis Fogerson, is the school board involved in it, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| Well, they'll make what we make, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| Yeah, they have to make what we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| So, yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Mr. Jarrett, I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| The charter reads that school board members receive the same compensation and benefits as with the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:18| So it wouldn't affect line employees of the Board of Education, but it will certainly affect the school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:29| Commissioner Briggs, do you have other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| Yeah, I'm not going to – we'll vote on this here in a minute and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| I think that we have to look at also, and this gets a little bit about what Commissioner McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:41| the Social Security beneficiaries have not received an increase in their cost of living or any change since 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:50| They will get a 3.6 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| The veterans have received no increase in their pay also since 2009 based on the cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| You know, I know everyone, and I do appreciate the work that the county does, the county employees do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| and I think we need to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| They do have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| I have a feeling if there were any jobs open that in a competitive marketplace that any vacancies would be filled very rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:20| The people who I feel sorry for aren't the people that have jobs in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| but it's the people who are out there working every day and paying taxes so somebody else is getting a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| Quite frankly, if I had my druthers, I'd like to cut taxes and give money back to some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| that have been paying it that are absolutely suffering right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| Almost one in ten Tennesseans are unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| I think our unemployment rate was 9.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| We have people in this county who are not receiving any pay increases every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| and we have people in this county who don't even have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| Nevertheless, you know, nevertheless, just not to be, you know, the gringe that stole Christmas or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7793)|
| 2:10:00| you know, I'll go ahead and support this this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| but I do want to recognize that there's other people out there that no one seems to care about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| and those are the taxpayers and those are the people that are also, you know, they're also suffering this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| And, you know, my question is, what are we doing to give them some relief also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| The final comment, you know, that I have to make is we say we've got a little extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| The decisions that we make are not made in a void or made in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| And the monies that we take for this this year and all the years going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| because this is not a one-time bonus because we had a little extra money coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| this will be a permanent part, you know, of our budget, you know, going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| We're going to have needs, I've read already, where the school board is short $7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| and we may very well have to close schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| Now, where do we put our priorities, to get pay raises or to close schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| I'm not saying that one is better than the other or one's more deserving of the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| and I'm not making any judgment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| I'm just saying that this is what we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| These decisions that we make are not made in isolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| and we have to consider some of the other needs, you know, of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| You know, I'm going to go ahead and listen to the rest of this discussion to see if whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| you know, whether I can support what, you know, what was just proposed as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:25| But, you know, I think we need to take all that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| I hear a lot of us up here feeling that we're advocating for a very small group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| but I also, at some point, think we have to advocate also for people who are also struggling out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| who don't have jobs and who are paying taxes and have not had a pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| who's sending their money to this county who may see their child's school closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| because there's not enough money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| Yeah, I want to speak to Commissioner Wright's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| As much as pretty as it sounds and as easy as it sounds, it's, number one, accounting, it wouldn't be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| Number two is when you do stuff, when you do it, take a lump of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| and you divide it evenly amongst the ranks, it creates compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| And it takes us years and years to get away from that compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| So you begin to see things, people that have been here for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| become less than enthused about working here because the guy that they hired in yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| is making almost as much money as those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| And that compression would have a huge impact on compression if we just split it evenly among the recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:41| It just sounds good and it looks good, but it creates an accounting nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| And it's not fair to the people that have been working for a long time to gain that longevity and seniority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:54| And so the more compression we create, the more our problems are down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| I mean, that's a good idea you came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| I've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:06| I guess this is for Mr. Troyer and or Frances, either one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| What's your take on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| This is news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| I just heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| But what's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| Is this something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| I think it's vitally important that we maintain the statistical validity of the compensation system that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:23| If we give each person an equal dollar amount, now every one of us is off step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:31| We have no compensation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| And we've worked very hard for quite a few years for this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| There are two ways that you can give an increase and still maintain the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:45| One is a step increase and the other is an equal percentage increase, so that everybody gets one step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:53| or everybody gets a specific percentage, but it's everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:59| And I think that it's been discussed since your last meeting that the greater number of employees would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:07| advantaged by the three percent as opposed to the step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| So you'll get more money to more people by doing the three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| But it has an additional benefit that is very dear to people that are in the compensation business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| and that is it makes us a bit more competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| We haven't adjusted the scale overall since July of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| We've been slipping behind each year that we have not given a percentage increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| so that we now are lagging the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| A step raise won't adjust the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| A percentage increase will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| So you've got a double benefit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| A three percent increase puts money in the pockets of more people, a greater amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8095)|
| 2:15:02| and it also addresses our market rate, our competitiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:09| Mr. Mayor, I'd like to hear you chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| What do you feel about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| I agree with what Frances said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| Tim Burchett, county mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| I think we have to be real careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| We dealt with that in Nashville forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| It seemed the compression was the biggest problem that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| I handled the pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I think it was the last significant pay raise that the state employees received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| And that was one of the problems we were trying to correct was compression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| It's very difficult to make folks understand that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| But when we've got people that have been working for the county for 15 or so years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:49| somebody's been there six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| and we end up that is beneath them in pay and also in qualifications and ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:58| And then we raise their pay up arbitrarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| I think it creates a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| And that's a problem they've been trying to correct for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| And I think they've done a good job of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| And I think this would further complicate the problem if we passed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| our respect to the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| But that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Yeah, and I see what you're saying, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| You know, Mr. Mayor, the way I look at it, on the surface, OK, it sounds like a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| But the way I look at it is us up here, we're public servants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| And it looks like we'd get the biggest pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| And that sure would not go with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| I'm not too happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| If we did it, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| I don't think that was Commissioner Wright's objective at all was to give himself a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| I just think he was trying to look after folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| And I think that's why we have this deliberative body here to discuss those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| Yeah, my wildest dreams, that was Commissioner Wright's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| No, and I don't think it was either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| I don't think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| But I just, if we do that, I mean, I would feel that we, as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| ought to exclude ourselves from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| But, I mean, thanks for thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| I'm in favor of this 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| I don't like the step increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| It's about giving more money as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| Like Frances said, 3% is going to give more money to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| And since I will forego my 3% because I do not want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:23| I'd rather the county workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| I have a regular job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| And I'm not saying I'm rich or wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| I'm just saying that I didn't get in for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| And I will forego my 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| Question, John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| I want to make sure that I have my numbers with regards to Commissioner Wright's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| His suggestion, as I recall, and I want to make sure I'm correct on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| is take the $1.5 million approximately and divide it over six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| That would be about $262,900 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| And then that would be given equally to all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| There's about 2,200 employees, if my math is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| So each employee would get about $120 a month, which is about $60 a pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| So everybody under this proposal would get the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| Is my math correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| I mean, are my numbers correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| I'm not that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| I need to use a calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| No, but I mean, as far as the 2,200 employees, that's about correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| That's who would get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| And so, anyway, I may be off a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| But, anyway, I'm just trying to get a feel in my mind that everyone under this proposal would get about $60 a pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| Each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Now, I guess, Commissioner Wright, under your proposal, is this how it would be done next year as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| That from here on out, that money would be given each month with the same amount given per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:46| So next year, instead of $1.5, it would be $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| That would be divided by 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| And this is all based on where we were six months ago and where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| We're trying to help those employees of Knox County that are at the low end of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| And then I'll get back to you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:08| The one thing that has kind of been alluded to a couple of times is, number one, the compression factor in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| But by doing the straight 3% across the board, our matrix was set up on a step-raise system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:25| We are, by virtue of not doing it for three or four years, we've skewed that system horribly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| But by doing this 3% across the board, it puts us more in line by being able to do step-raises the next time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:40| and get back into the regular circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| So that would be my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| Mr. Wright, you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| A couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| A couple of comments to some of the statements that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| First, it is acceptable here among commissioners that we should advocate for our point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8392)|
| 2:20:01| And I appreciate how people think and try to walk the walk, you know, follow what you're trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:13| But some of the words that I've heard come out, compression, well, if we've had percentage raises all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:22| then we've been going, have we been, is this, I can't see how every time it should be a percentage raise then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:37| because the further apart, that's how you get further and further apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:44| Let me back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| We were trying to help the bottom when we talked about it a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| We're trying to help the bottom when we talk about it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| And we will talk about something else at the next budget cycle, which, Mr. Chairman, you've already alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:57| What are we going to do next budget cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| You know, maybe we'll be back to a percentage increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| Maybe we won't have any percentage increase at all because we may not have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| It may be like it was at the last budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:15| Some other words that I've written down here, but I've lost my train of thought on what those words may have alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| One of the things was someone said it would make an accounting nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| With computer systems, as we have today, this is not ledger and everybody with pencil and paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:33| This is programming and this is high-tech stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| And maybe those are the people that need a six percent raise and the rest of us just need a percent and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| Statistically, it's going to skew our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| Well, that's a good statement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| I would like to maybe apply a law that says move and apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:56| I can't think of many people that are leaving employment in Knox County and going to a surrounding county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| I can't think of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| Maybe there's a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Maybe there are several good examples out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| But I can give you examples of Knox County having openings and a couple hundred people applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| Some of them overqualified for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| So it's nice to work for Knox County at the good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| What we need to do is help those people that are already employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| This, again, is the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:32| I've heard it two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| It's a greater amount of money to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| It's a greater amount of money to those people that are above $35,921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:46| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| Those people will get more money because that $35,921 person is in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:54| Everyone below that, go down to $25,000, is only going to get $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8574)|
| 2:23:01| The $100,000 person gets $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| I think I've spoken all that I can about, you know, how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| And there we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| Mr. Mayor, if it will help you, too, I will be like Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| I will forego the 3% too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| It will help your kitty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| So, oh, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| Francis, I had another question there about one of your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| In terms of what Commissioner Wright's proposing, you know, just basically an amount spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| to everyone in the county, and this sort of invalidates the step system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| Why is it not, why are we not able to just take that amount, add it to the step, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| you've just created a new step for everyone in the county, and then go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| I don't understand how that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| You're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| You've got a dollar amount on this particular step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| You've added that dollar amount to that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| You've just created a new step every single time for everyone in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| Is that a, so does that throw everything out of whack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| What does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:17| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| See if I can explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| Our scale was developed, and one thing that we have done is we have benchmarked against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| a lot of similar organizations, similar governments, and that we have judged a particular job to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:44| have a salary range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| You know, this is our minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:48| This is our midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| This is our maximum salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| And they're all, they're in alignment like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:56| When you add an equal dollar amount to each of those, I'm struggling to find a simplified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8696)|
| 2:25:08| way to explain this, but they don't keep the same balance between the steps, between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:14| jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| They've talked about compression coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| You can do it in a percentage way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| You could do it in the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| Now, the steps are not even dollar amounts apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| Across the scale in the same pay grade, they are not even dollar amounts apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| And when you go from a lower numbered pay grade to a higher number, they are not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| dollar amounts apart because there's a different starting point and there's a different maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:46| The range is just different for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| As I stated before, the only way to keep the compensation system intact is to give either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:57| a step raise or to give an even percentage raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| At times, people have talked about naming a particular salary and saying we'll do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| different for people below this number, something different for people above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:13| You cannot, you can't take a pair of scissors and just cut our scale and say all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| are below and all these people are above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| Any given number, you draw stair steps across the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| And it, a system that is based upon a particular wage favors the new employee over the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8786)|
| 2:26:36| with greater longevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| Perhaps that's rambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| I'll go back to my basic point is you keep the system valid if you give a step raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:48| or if you give an equal percentage raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| And right now, I contend that giving an equal percentage raise has two very important effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:59| It gives more people more money and it increases our market rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| It makes us more competitive as an employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part1?start=8824)|
