| 2:44:44| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| I'm trying to get up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| Send the letter to the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut and their response was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9895)|
| 2:45:04| We have sent, I know the mayor, this commission passed a resolution that authorized us to send a letter to Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9904)|
| 2:45:13| and in turn, based on that, there's a lot of specific, by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9913)|
| 2:45:18| what needs to happen in terms of him communicating to the town of Knoxville and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9918)|
| 2:45:23| That has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| In fact, frankly, the mayor jumped on it pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| getting that communication extended to the city of Knoxville and the city of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| So that has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| And they've responded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| I personally haven't received any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| The mayor's shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| I can say at the last meeting, I know that the vice mayor of Farragut speaking for the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9941)|
| 2:45:47| indicated that they wanted to come back to the table on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| I haven't had a formal conversation with anyone representing the city of Knoxville on this specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9950)|
| 2:45:57| I would hope that they would, but I can't speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9957)|
| 2:46:03| Because my concern is if we're interested in postponing an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| this gives the community an opportunity to, and I appreciate Commissioner Busser's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| but we no longer live in isolated communities here in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| I mean, you know, we can say Powell and we can say Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| but all of the county is connected by utilities and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9984)|
| 2:46:28| They're all connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| And the cost associated with that impacts all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| So I would appreciate conversations between, if this is approved, between now and July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=9994)|
| 2:46:40| to actually hear from what the community has to say in each of the districts that we serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10000)|
| 2:46:47| because they are all interrelated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10007)|
| 2:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10011)|
| 2:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Mr. Skinmaker, I know that Mr. Hare has approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| Would you like to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| Yeah, I'd like to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| He's probably going to tell us when the letter was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10018)|
| 2:47:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10020)|
| 2:47:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10021)|
| 2:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| The letter was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| And just to clarify, the letter was not just sent to the Town of Farragut and the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| The statute required us to send the letter to the City of Knoxville, the Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| the Board of Education, Knoxville Utility Board, Hallsdale Powell Utility Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| the Soil Conservation District, and the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| At this time, we have not received any responses, nor have any official conversations taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10043)|
| 2:47:29| So we'll keep you all posted as soon as we get updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10052)|
| 2:47:33| And how long ago was that sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10055)|
| 2:47:36| That was sent out last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| Oh, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| I'd like to go ahead and recognize Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| He had turned on his light initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| I recognize Mr. Jay, and then we'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| Last week's discussion was we had no idea what any kind of proposal from MPC would cost the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10073)|
| 2:48:02| And since we have representatives from the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10082)|
| 2:48:07| would they like to give us an update based on the discussion from the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10092)|
| 2:48:13| I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| But I will say then, Commissioner Jay, I'll get to you after we have our representatives from MPC address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10095)|
| 2:48:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10102)|
| 2:48:26| Jeff Welch, 400 Main Street Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10106)|
| 2:48:30| I didn't get the last week's workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| Gerald Green indicated the desire was to, and what we heard from the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10112)|
| 2:48:38| is to move forward with the procurement office, Knox County Procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10118)|
| 2:48:42| to develop a request for qualifications to find a scope of work that would update the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10122)|
| 2:48:50| Mr. Green indicated that the cost might be around $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10130)|
| 2:48:55| We've gotten a couple of other estimates from other communities ranging, again, from $300,000 all the way up to $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10135)|
| 2:49:05| And it all depends, I think, on the scope of work you want to have involved in doing the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10145)|
| 2:49:11| the level of public and community involvement you want in a community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| That will take a considerable amount of time and effort in meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| and all that means is that we'll be engaging the public in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10159)|
| 2:49:25| How we go about it is how you would work out the scope of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| The comment about spending an extra four months, Mr. McGill, on engaging the public is a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10169)|
| 2:49:37| so that can help us if the commission desires to go down the path to help us better define the scope of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10177)|
| 2:49:44| the level of public involvement, the community engagement that we need to have in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| So we're not in a position that we could go out and hire a consultant at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10189)|
| 2:49:55| Once you develop that scope of services, then you would get costs associated with the consulting firms to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10195)|
| 2:50:02| Then we would come back to the commission with a formal request for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| Okay. Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| Recognizing Commissioner Schoonmaker, you asked a question and your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10211)|
| 2:50:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| And then the other issue as far as the state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| it's been assigned to a subcommittee of property and planning, but it's not put on any committee agenda either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10221)|
| 2:50:32| And we have one of our local Knoxville legislators who serves on that subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10232)|
| 2:50:39| And, again, I still think it's just a caption bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10239)|
| 2:50:46| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| I know I'm the new guy, one of the new guys here, this wing of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| but it baffles me a little bit that we would appropriate funds for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10260)|
| 2:51:06| we don't know what we're appropriating funds for, don't have a scope or a set of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10266)|
| 2:51:12| or a plan of action for exercising that scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| and don't have an understanding from a state legislature of what may be applicable within the scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10276)|
| 2:51:25| And it just seems really disconnected to go ahead and pick a dollar amount based upon a couple of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10285)|
| 2:51:35| without a real plan of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10295)|
| 2:51:38| And so I just want to lend my support for the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| If I don't understand this correctly, tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| but there's nothing I can see that would prevent our planning team from developing a scope of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10306)|
| 2:51:53| even going out and getting proposals for that scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| or bringing that scope of work to us in the time period between now and July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10316)|
| 2:52:02| So I think there's a lot of work that can be done in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| but I sure would love to know the cards that I have in my hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| before I decide whether or not to put some money on the table and bet with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| And it seems like we're a little bit blindfolded here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10331)|
| 2:52:14| So I'd just like to lend my support for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| I think we can get this narrowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| I, too, have watched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10340)|
| 2:52:23| I was not here during that long discussion, but I have watched it several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| And the more we discuss this, the more I'm confused with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| And if we can figure out a way to simplify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| and go forth with a better scope of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| I sure would be a whole lot more supportive of spending taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| on a laser-focused objective versus a little bit of a scatter shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| So I just wanted to lend my opinion to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10366)|
| 2:52:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10367)|
| 2:52:48| Commissioner Jay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| I recognize Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| And I think the parameters we have at this point are so broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10373)|
| 2:52:58| that that scope of service could not be defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| even with the amount of money we had associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10382)|
| 2:53:05| And I must have missed something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| because I thought the amount of money was $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| Now the amount has ballooned beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10390)|
| 2:53:14| And if the MPC staff is having conversations in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| even at the sector plan level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| then those scope of services can now even be defined under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| I'm a little confused as to why they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10406)|
| 2:53:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| The chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| You can clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10414)|
| 2:53:35| Because if the East Sector Plan was just done a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| then the scope of services as we are having the sector plan conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10423)|
| 2:53:49| Well, the East County Sector Plan was not just done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| It was a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| Those were one-year plans for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| which is totally separate from what we're talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| as far as the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| Those were one-year plan meetings for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10444)|
| 2:54:05| And is it not possible to have an extended conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10445)|
| 2:54:09| as we have already planned those sector meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| to have conversations with the public that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| Well, that would just be within the city of Knoxville sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10456)|
| 2:54:20| for the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10460)|
| 2:54:21| This would be, we're talking about a countywide general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| that would encompass several meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| hundreds of meetings most likely throughout the development of a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| Again, that scope of work needs to be flushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| It needs to be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| Your level of public and community engagement needs to be included with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| And, again, you just can't do it on one meeting alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10483)|
| 2:54:47| That just occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| And you're saying the staff there doesn't have the capacity to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10489)|
| 2:54:55| The staff does not have the capacity at the planning right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| to do a general plan update for the entire Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10502)|
| 2:55:03| That is why we would need to engage a consultant to assist us with that effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| which is that effort would take a year to 18 months or more, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10507)|
| 2:55:11| depending on the level of community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10511)|
| 2:55:14| We don't have the resources to just give a more narrow focus for that even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10514)|
| 2:55:20| We could come up with a scope, a really broad scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| but I think we'd want to have more discussion, engage the county commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10524)|
| 2:55:29| and the community on what is some of the major issues that we need to be addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10529)|
| 2:55:35| as we prepare and finalize that scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| and before we proceed in with the general plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10538)|
| 2:55:41| So I think there's some work that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| and I guess from the staff standpoint is we're looking for some type of a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10544)|
| 2:55:49| on the part of the commission that is there a desire to do a general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10549)|
| 2:55:54| Will there be financial resources there to do a general plan in July if you postpone this until then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10554)|
| 2:56:03| Is there a desire on the county commission to update the county general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10563)|
| 2:56:10| Right now we're hearing obviously not a consensus at the commission level yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10570)|
| 2:56:15| And so the $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| I'm not sure where that $100,000 came from, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| Okay. The chair recognizes Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| If we could, there's several members from the public that I think would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10589)|
| 2:56:33| I'd like to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| And staying with Robert's rules of order, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| and I told the public they would have a chance to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| So I'll invite a couple of members from the public to talk to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10600)|
| 2:56:44| I'll then move on to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| Well, can I follow up with them after they finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| Yeah, after they finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| The chair has not expressed any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| I've been running the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| I haven't even spoken to this subject myself yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| So at some point I'll be weighing in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| But I do want to make sure everybody gets on the table first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| Go ahead and name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| Thank you, Chairman Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10624)|
| 2:57:05| Kim Frazier, 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| I just wanted to speak to two of the points that were brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10628)|
| 2:57:12| And that's I've had conversations with Senator Briggs over the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| and his comments were I think that MPC, County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| and the citizens have to decide what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| My intention is to do nothing at the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| I will wait and see what elected representatives the County Commission needs or wants, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| No bill has been put on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| In the conversations with him, he basically told me these are two separate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| and nothing that you do or decide here should have any relation to what is going on at the state level currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10659)|
| 2:57:47| I don't see a reason to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| I don't see a reason not to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| Everything that you all are discussing, having community meetings, having more educational seminars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| that is all a part of defining the scope of services and the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10677)|
| 2:58:02| I've also talked with Rutherford County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| I've talked to the city of Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10684)|
| 2:58:07| As far as costs go, we are right in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| Actually, we're very low on a $350,000 estimate that was given by Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10690)|
| 2:58:17| Rutherford County, they are also shopping around for consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| My question to them was so your planning commission cannot handle the scope of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| They said absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| It is massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| You will have to bring in outside consultants, and we are shopping them around currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| Our quotes are coming in anywhere from $300,000 to $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10716)|
| 2:58:42| The city of Murfreesboro just completed a new growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| It cost them around $300,000 to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10726)|
| 2:58:50| Also, I talked to a city in Ohio just to get another perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10730)|
| 2:58:55| They just finished their plan for a population of 128,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10735)|
| 2:59:00| and it cost them nearly $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| So just to speak to some of the funding questions that you've had to note that if we are in line or if we are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10743)|
| 2:59:10| it sounds very much like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| It also sounds very much like using outside consultants to do this work is right in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10752)|
| 2:59:19| So I just wanted to speak to that and give you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| Thank you, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10767)|
| 2:59:28| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| Laura Cole, 316 Bob Smith Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| I just wanted to speak to the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10774)|
| 2:59:37| I'm hearing names of plans used interchangeably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| I know there's a lot of confusion, and I just wanted to offer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| As somebody who came on to MPC and had to learn all this, the growth policy plan is 20-year growth projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10785)|
| 2:59:53| It's a very big, broad view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| It was also given to us by state mandate, Tennessee General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10796)|
| 3:00:03| The general plan is a long-range vision and policy framework for physical and economic development in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| and Knox County created through public participation with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10809)|
| 3:00:15| And then it goes down to sector plans and then other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| And I have all that on a one-pager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| I know Mr. Davis read out a lot of names, but you can group these plans and understand what their purpose and scope is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10821)|
| 3:00:28| And I also wanted to speak to the idea of sunsetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| I've heard sunsetting and expiration of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10831)|
| 3:00:37| but according to the Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, these plans do not expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10837)|
| 3:00:45| They can be revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| There are two methods of revision that the mayor can use to change them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10847)|
| 3:00:52| but my understanding is that they do not sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| They don't go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| So if we do nothing, we will still be dealing with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10857)|
| 3:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10865)|
| 3:01:06| Mr. Schoonmaker, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| Could I just reserve mine towards the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10872)|
| 3:01:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10875)|
| 3:01:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| Could I ask a question to one of our public forum speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10878)|
| 3:01:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| Ms. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| To add to the continued layers of confusion, all I've heard in every argument up until this point was the state says you have to do X, Y, and Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10886)|
| 3:01:38| and the state says you can only amend by X, Y, and Z, and the state has to do that, and the state, and the state, and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10898)|
| 3:01:43| And you just said you guys don't even have, you have nothing to do with, you do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10903)|
| 3:01:48| The state doesn't mandate anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| That's in regards to the caption bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10914)|
| 3:01:55| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10915)|
| 3:01:56| But we, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10916)|
| 3:01:58| So essentially, okay, I just wanted to make sure it was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| Yeah, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10921)|
| 3:02:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| That was Senator Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| And that's Senator Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10924)|
| 3:02:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10925)|
| 3:02:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10927)|
| 3:02:08| That's just Senator Briggs' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| Okay, it's just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10929)|
| 3:02:10| There's nothing going on at the state that determines whether or not these are, the mandated efforts from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| or the mandated plans from the state are extended, or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| But to his point, you should not slow any momentum with working towards updating your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10939)|
| 3:02:27| Well, but understanding what is required and isn't required is certainly relevant to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10947)|
| 3:02:32| You wouldn't, you know, pay to remodel your house if the roof was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| Well, I've spoken to several other counties that have either just completed it or are shopping it out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10957)|
| 3:02:43| They are not stopping their progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| So I don't see a reason for us to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10966)|
| 3:02:48| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10968)|
| 3:02:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10970)|
| 3:02:51| And I would love to, for Ms. Cole, our second speaker, that whatever the list you had of the different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10971)|
| 3:02:56| the site map of the different plans, if you could give a copy of that to our commission team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10976)|
| 3:03:03| I'd love to see that, whatever it is that you mentioned that had the sort of layout of the different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10983)|
| 3:03:09| That would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| As it relates to, I think, I haven't heard a single person in this, in our commission group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10991)|
| 3:03:18| say that they were not interested in good planning or updating things that have been sitting on the shelf for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| So I think that there's a, there is a commitment from commission to go forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| But we want to go forth in a smart way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| And I think it's, I just think it's imperative to try to find a way to simplify things and focus our efforts so we're not duplicating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11011)|
| 3:03:41| I do have a question for our planning team, quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| Is there anything that would prevent you from, is there any financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11025)|
| 3:03:52| or anything from this commission that would prevent you from continuing to narrow what the scope of work might be for an RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11032)|
| 3:03:59| Is there any barrier to actually thinking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| I think it's the standpoint of what we would need to want to include in that as far as the breadth of the analysis that we'd be involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11043)|
| 3:04:14| Would we be wanting to include, you know, all the utilities out there, the sewer and water and other infrastructure there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11054)|
| 3:04:23| We've had some conversations already with the Environment and Public Works about what is the impact of the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11063)|
| 3:04:30| and how that could help communicate a strategic transportation investment plan also for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| So we're starting those types of discussions in anticipation that the commission would want to move in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11076)|
| 3:04:43| But you don't need an appropriation to have some community meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| Not at this time, but I guess as you develop a scope of work again, you have to have a better understanding of the breadth of that scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11087)|
| 3:04:55| I totally get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| I guess there's nothing preventing from our planning team from holding a community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11097)|
| 3:05:04| or holding a meeting with the mayor and the commission and the 15 stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| and saying we feel like we're heading in this direction, we would like to figure out a scope of work that we can start agreeing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11108)|
| 3:05:15| can everybody weigh in and get that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11115)|
| 3:05:18| I mean, there's nothing that's preventing that from happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11118)|
| 3:05:21| Again, I think that was sort of up in the workshop was sort of the direction the commission was going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| was that to request the planning commission, staff, and procurement to begin to work a development of a scope of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11125)|
| 3:05:33| And we would not do that in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| We would want to engage the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11136)|
| 3:05:39| But there's no reason you can't do that right now with or without a resolution from us or any appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| Probably true, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11144)|
| 3:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11145)|
| 3:05:46| So that's where I'm confused of why we are needing to act at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| If we've all made it clear that we want good planning and we're heading towards this direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11149)|
| 3:05:54| can we not simply say go forth and start working on a scope so we can see what we might be bidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11154)|
| 3:06:00| who might be bidding, and what the scope might be and what we might be paying for down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| I'm just confused as to why we need to do anything right now other than make our intentions known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11169)|
| 3:06:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11170)|
| 3:06:11| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11171)|
| 3:06:12| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| I think Randy hadn't spoke on this yet, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11177)|
| 3:06:18| Randy, did you speak at the beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| Actually, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11180)|
| 3:06:21| Randy had not spoken on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| So go ahead, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11185)|
| 3:06:28| Last month the public asked us not to vote to ask the state legislator to do away with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11188)|
| 3:06:37| They asked us to have the mayor reconvene and try to amend the growth plan through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11197)|
| 3:06:45| We've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| I think we should wait and give that process to see what happens with it before we appropriate any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11207)|
| 3:06:54| But I completely agree with Commissioner Jay that the scope of services for our general plan update can be gathered and analyzed and put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11214)|
| 3:07:06| I think we should wait until we know what table we're sitting at before we start spending money on what plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11226)|
| 3:07:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11237)|
| 3:07:18| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| And I think that's pretty much what I was saying too, Randy, because I keep hearing general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11242)|
| 3:07:29| and then we keep talking about the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| So the dollars, what are we talking about doing, both of them being in that scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11252)|
| 3:07:38| or all the counties doing the general plan and a growth policy and they're lumping it all into one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11258)|
| 3:07:46| Is that where they're getting their high costs from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11266)|
| 3:07:51| No matter what you call it, I don't think the high cost is not because you have a growth policy plan and a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11271)|
| 3:07:57| It's a high cost because it takes a lot of time and effort to engage the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11277)|
| 3:08:02| and look at the issues and where the community wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| If you don't have a plan, where do you know where you're going to invest your public dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11286)|
| 3:08:11| You really need to have a plan of where you're going to invest your money for streets and highways, schools, and other utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11291)|
| 3:08:18| If you don't know where you're going, I think that begs the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11298)|
| 3:08:23| The staff really wants to get a commitment from the commission that we would like you to develop the scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11303)|
| 3:08:31| so that when we do that, hopefully as you develop your budget or at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11311)|
| 3:08:37| that the money then can be available and allocated for developing the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11317)|
| 3:08:43| So I think there is obviously a hesitation on the part of staff of putting a lot of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11323)|
| 3:08:51| in developing a scope and engaging the community that come June or when the budget is adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11331)|
| 3:08:57| that there's no funding available for a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| That's why I'd like to see what we committed ourselves to doing at the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11340)|
| 3:09:08| We put that out there and we're waiting to see because I thought that's what everyone wanted us to do was to involve everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11348)|
| 3:09:18| I have a follow-up question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| Okay, go ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| Jeff, when the city did recode, did you all work up the scope of services before they awarded the contract on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11363)|
| 3:09:32| Of course. Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| You had to do that as you solicited proposals for qualified services, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11374)|
| 3:09:40| And we're not asking for, again, at this point, planning commissioner, we're not asking for money up front, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11380)|
| 3:09:47| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| I just had a question for the law director, if that's okay, just a little bit of clarification for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11390)|
| 3:09:56| At this time, what is legally required for the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11396)|
| 3:10:01| I mean, is there just a brief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11401)|
| 3:10:06| Knox County's growth policy plan right now, there's two sections to the growth policy plan by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11406)|
| 3:10:14| The first section is mandamus, and we have that, and it is to create three geographical areas to be set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11414)|
| 3:10:22| One's the urban area, one's the growth policy plan area, and one's the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11422)|
| 3:10:28| Those are required by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| Everything else is optional, which may be part of it where you develop similar things like the zoning or the restrictions or how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11432)|
| 3:10:43| And that could be driven out of your general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| You could actually do the general plan and then hook it in as the optional piece of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11447)|
| 3:10:55| But we're really talking two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11455)|
| 3:10:59| I think that MPC is looking, do you want us to upgrade the general plan for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11459)|
| 3:11:06| And then if we do that, that may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11466)|
| 3:11:10| It depends on how the growth policy team decides whether they want to use the current general plan and or an updated one in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11470)|
| 3:11:21| as part of the growth plan optional for transportation, for schools, for roads, for zonings, for those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11481)|
| 3:11:30| So right now, Commissioner, we are in compliance with the three mandamus pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11490)|
| 3:11:37| And the other pieces, by agreement of the parties, were basically terminated on December the 31st, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11497)|
| 3:11:47| But we still have the three areas identified under the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| And the mayor is currently looking at what are we going to do under the optional plan, which you asked him to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11513)|
| 3:11:59| And he sent out the letters to all the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| And they're going to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| I think what I'm hearing now, though, is MPC is wanting to upgrade the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11524)|
| 3:12:10| or have a direction to whether you want it upgraded or not, which is two completely different conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11530)|
| 3:12:17| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11537)|
| 3:12:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11538)|
| 3:12:19| But they do and can intermerge later on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11539)|
| 3:12:22| If I might weigh in, speaking just as the 4th District Commissioner rather than, say, as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11542)|
| 3:12:28| one thing I've heard loud and clear from everybody who might be, you know, move forward a plan, hold this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11548)|
| 3:12:35| is there seems to be consensus on updating general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11555)|
| 3:12:40| I mean, I've heard that very clearly from everybody is that, you know, the general plan guides us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11560)|
| 3:12:46| helps us get a lot of stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| But I've also heard clearly from our partners at Knoxville-Knox County Planning is, hey, can you let,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11569)|
| 3:12:56| and I'll say this, whatever happens with the growth plan, if it dies in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11576)|
| 3:13:03| or if it's rebirthed like the Phoenix in Nashville, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| We're still going to have to update the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11587)|
| 3:13:10| I think that's something that we, while I can't speak for everybody, that's something that's going to have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11590)|
| 3:13:17| And what I'm hearing from Jeff, speaking on behalf of MPC, is what they'd like from us is at least a little bit of direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11597)|
| 3:13:24| or to help them, what I wrote down after my notes was bring us options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11604)|
| 3:13:31| And I'm speaking for myself, at least on behalf of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| is one outcome that we might want to get to is a day that could be in June or July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11614)|
| 3:13:41| where you're coming to this commission with options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11621)|
| 3:13:45| If you do the simple version of a general plan update, it's going to be this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| If you do the full-fledged update of the general plan, this type of detailed planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11630)|
| 3:13:55| where we've got all the road infrastructure and the school infrastructure and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11635)|
| 3:13:59| it's probably going to cost a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| And that's kind of an outcome that I'd like to see us get to is when we can have a productive meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11642)|
| 3:14:09| in several months, three months, six months, however down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| where MPC comes to us with options, in particular, say, related to the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| that says this is how much it's going to cost to do this and present us with options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| Once you get going down that plan, that's when you've probably got to tighten up your RFQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| for the higher consultant to help with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11669)|
| 3:14:34| At least, you know, that's my personal take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| So one option that I would say, I'm not making this yet maybe as a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| but one thing that we could consider is, you know, speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11682)|
| 3:14:48| and I put this originally on the agenda based on last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11688)|
| 3:14:52| You know, we talked, we said we're going to update the growth plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| and at that meeting I made a commitment that I would bring to the next month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| a resolution to help us begin the process of allocating funding for updating these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11699)|
| 3:15:06| And I am intentionally saying plans, knowing that we've got a growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| and a general plan to update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| But one thing that I may want to find out if this body wants to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11713)|
| 3:15:17| if that would help MPC move forward a little bit, is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| just something much more simple, not tied to any money, that just says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11721)|
| 3:15:25| can you begin development of options to bring to us this summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11725)|
| 3:15:30| I mean, that's just something that I'd like to know in particular as it relates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| because either way we're going to have to update the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| So that's my $2.50 worth statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11737)|
| 3:15:43| But moving on, putting the chairman's hat back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| Commissioner Skinmaker, you had said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| but I think Commissioner Busler's light had been on and he had deferred it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| so I'll recognize Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11752)|
| 3:15:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11756)|
| 3:15:57| We're sitting here and we're talking about things that we know nothing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| what's going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11760)|
| 3:16:02| Like Larson Jay said some time ago, you don't have a crystal ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11762)|
| 3:16:06| but you do have an idea about where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| The mode of transportations are going to turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| They're going to be different than what they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| We see 20 years ago or 30 years ago what cars were like and what they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11774)|
| 3:16:19| That will probably change even quicker because we're changing so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11779)|
| 3:16:23| Schools, we're talking about brick and mortar planning for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| Are we going to have virtual schools or are we going to have brick and mortar schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| We don't know what the trends are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| But people have given out ideas what the future is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11793)|
| 3:16:38| And what we're doing right now is planning what we did 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| planning now for another 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11801)|
| 3:16:44| We don't have any idea what it's going to look like 10 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11804)|
| 3:16:48| but it's not going to look like it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11808)|
| 3:16:51| And the schools are not going to look like they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| The roads are not going to look like they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| Everything is changing so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| And the people that can change quickly can keep up with what the demands are from our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11818)|
| 3:17:06| Having said that, we've had a flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| We're going to use a lot of money to try to make up for the roads and things that's been destroyed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11828)|
| 3:17:13| We've got to redo that infrastructure for our cars we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11833)|
| 3:17:17| We've got houses that are flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| We've got to help people to get back to where they were before this flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| Now, we're going to spend extra money on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| We don't know what the future's going to be, but we have some ideas what they might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11846)|
| 3:17:32| But MPC is mandated by what we have on the books now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11852)|
| 3:17:37| They've got to go with what's on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| And we've got so many different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11859)|
| 3:17:42| They can use all kinds of plans or combinations of those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11862)|
| 3:17:47| What we've got to do is make government a little bit more simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11867)|
| 3:17:52| in a way that the community can communicate with us what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11872)|
| 3:17:58| Maybe not what they're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| But we're spending money now with no direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11883)|
| 3:18:08| Because we know ten years from now, this is not going to look like it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11888)|
| 3:18:14| It may be even going faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11894)|
| 3:18:15| We don't even know what the communication is going to be like ten years from today or five years from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11895)|
| 3:18:20| But it is changing so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11900)|
| 3:18:23| So whatever the plans are going to be, we've got to have some sort of a semi-crystal ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11903)|
| 3:18:30| and say this may be what it looks like and this is where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| Instead of sitting here and saying we're going to do a plan right now with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11914)|
| 3:18:39| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11919)|
| 3:18:40| What are we spending the money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| And with all these laws that's on the books, it's going to be so hard for developers to even try to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11923)|
| 3:18:51| because they've got to do all these sort of things that they can't do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11931)|
| 3:18:56| And again, the communities, no matter what you say, there's communities all over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11936)|
| 3:19:01| and there's pods of people that get together that love to be together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11941)|
| 3:19:06| And sometimes they're built around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| Sometimes they're built around churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| Sometimes they're just built out in the middle of nowhere where people just get together and just like to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11950)|
| 3:19:14| and look at the nature park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| But whatever it is, we just don't have an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11956)|
| 3:19:19| But we're going to spend money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| The government likes to spend money on everything that we don't know what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11963)|
| 3:19:26| So I think we should sit down and talk to everybody and find out what you all want your community to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11966)|
| 3:19:34| and how the developers can keep up with what you want and make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11974)|
| 3:19:42| So I don't know what you're going to spend the money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| We've got a lot of other things we've got to spend the money on now besides the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11984)|
| 3:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| Josh, I saw you approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11993)|
| 3:19:54| I know that we've had some of our, I'll go ahead and let you say your two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11994)|
| 3:19:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11998)|
| 3:19:59| That's exactly what's going to be two cents, Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=11999)|
| 3:20:03| I came down here before Commissioner Buster said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12003)|
| 3:20:06| I completely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| And as we stand here in July in front of you all, I just want to go on the record that I hope MPC staff, Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12008)|
| 3:20:15| everyone talks to all of us collectively, not only as developers and builders, but as taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12015)|
| 3:20:25| I think having the two cents and the better growth plan will be better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12025)|
| 3:20:31| One thing is when I say talk to us developers, I can speak for Smithfield Homes directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12031)|
| 3:20:37| We just bought a piece of property that we will develop in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12037)|
| 3:20:42| That's so far in our future because we're building 350 houses a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12042)|
| 3:20:47| We have to be that far in advance of buying acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12047)|
| 3:20:51| That means we're already talking to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| That means we're already talking to whatever utility district we're in, making sure we have capacity and reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12053)|
| 3:20:59| So there's so much more that's going in, so much more going in as a developer and the less layers of government we can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12059)|
| 3:21:07| But with good planning, it's better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| We just got back from the International Home Builders Association in Las Vegas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12069)|
| 3:21:13| and I had the opportunity to talk to the top 200 builders in the United States, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12073)|
| 3:21:20| We had a couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| We have the exact same floor plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| We sell it here for $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12084)|
| 3:21:26| They sell it in Seattle or wherever they sell it for $350,000 or $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12086)|
| 3:21:30| and it all boils down to government interaction and government rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12090)|
| 3:21:38| Affordability was the biggest stretch and the biggest thing being pressed at the Home Builders Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12098)|
| 3:21:45| is that what are these people going to live in, how are they going to afford it, and what are developers doing to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12105)|
| 3:21:50| So we are buying land now, making plans for the next generation, whether they're baby boomers retiring into smaller units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12110)|
| 3:21:57| or they're Generation Y millennials getting in smaller units with bigger minis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12117)|
| 3:22:02| Whatever it is, affordability was pushed the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12122)|
| 3:22:05| and I just want to say that we are making plans of future growth of land purchases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12125)|
| 3:22:11| and land planning that are affected by this growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12131)|
| 3:22:16| So I just want to take my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12136)|
| 3:22:18| I hope standing here in July we can all say that not only did the citizens, the landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12138)|
| 3:22:23| and the developers all get to say just so we can come to some sort of conclusion to better serve Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12143)|
| 3:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| Okay, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| And just to clarify, the original motion, Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12156)|
| 3:22:39| is to take no action until the July meeting of Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12159)|
| 3:22:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| And that goes along just because we've seen a caption bill jump off the calendar and jump right through session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12168)|
| 3:22:54| So that allows some time for that to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| It also allows time for the mayor's discussions with the other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12177)|
| 3:23:02| and it also would allow others to get together on a possible scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| But the main reason is because you want to make sure that the General Assembly, what action they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12189)|
| 3:23:14| That is the main driver, but also we don't know what we're asking for today either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12194)|
| 3:23:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12198)|
| 3:23:19| We're looking at a dollar amount for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12199)|
| 3:23:21| Mr. Welch has already said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12203)|
| 3:23:24| Well, since, in my opinion, since the General Assembly has not even gone through a subcommittee at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12204)|
| 3:23:36| I would think that by our March 25th meeting we should understand what the state of Tennessee is doing at that point with the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12216)|
| 3:23:49| And the General Assembly will conclude about August the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12229)|
| 3:23:54| So, you know, I don't think that the public would perceive this as good government if we delayed something until the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12234)|
| 3:24:03| So I would like to make a substitute motion that we delay any action on this until March 25th with the stipulation that if the General Assembly has taken no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12243)|
| 3:24:15| or the bill has died, then we can move forward at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12255)|
| 3:24:19| If not, we would have the option to defer another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12259)|
| 3:24:22| But I don't think that, you know, we get criticized as a government that we get an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12262)|
| 3:24:30| and then we just kick the can down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12270)|
| 3:24:33| Well, there's no reason we should have an answer within the next 30 days most likely, if not within definitely the next 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12273)|
| 3:24:42| So I see no reason to defer until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12282)|
| 3:24:47| So I would like to make a substitute motion that we defer this until March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12287)|
| 3:24:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12293)|
| 3:24:54| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12294)|
| 3:24:55| A substitute motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker to defer action on this item to March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12295)|
| 3:25:03| Then we'll have the option to either defer again or to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| Is that clearly for the benefit of this board stating your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12307)|
| 3:25:12| Yes, and that gives a lot of parties an opportunity to provide more information, including the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12312)|
| 3:25:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| That motion was seconded by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| So the substitute motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12322)|
| 3:25:25| Commissioner Smith, your light has been on, so I want to recognize Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12325)|
| 3:25:28| and then I'll come back to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12328)|
| 3:25:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12332)|
| 3:25:33| First, I want to get a point of clarity from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12333)|
| 3:25:36| It's my understanding that, Chairman, you had said something about us initiating an urban growth policy plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12336)|
| 3:25:47| It's my understanding that is up to the committee to come forth with a plan which they take back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12347)|
| 3:25:54| and has to pass the county commission, the city of Knoxville, and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12354)|
| 3:26:03| So we really don't get a whole lot of say in that other than to vote up or down on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12363)|
| 3:26:07| We have an up or down vote on the growth plan, but we have control of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12367)|
| 3:26:13| And I think the chair's statement earlier was to clarify that whatever happens in Nashville with the life of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12373)|
| 3:26:21| and I don't want to even speculate on that, we still have control over the actual general plan here at this level for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12381)|
| 3:26:29| And I know that the Knoxville Planning Commission is asking for at least a little bit of direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12389)|
| 3:26:36| We know that that's something that we want to begin looking at the scope of how that could be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12396)|
| 3:26:42| We do, but our general plan cannot contradict the rural areas stated out in any urban growth policy plan that has passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12402)|
| 3:26:52| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| It can contradict it, but the growth policy plan would supersede as it does right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12415)|
| 3:27:00| Well, as it did, the former growth policy plan contradicted our general plan in the rural area, and it supersedes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12420)|
| 3:27:09| Currently, right now, you have a growth policy plan that has the geographical areas defined, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12429)|
| 3:27:15| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| The mayor is looking at amending the optional part, and maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12437)|
| 3:27:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12442)|
| 3:27:23| But anyway, this particular advancement from commission through the mayor is we're dealing with the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12443)|
| 3:27:35| The general plan that you're talking about is another thing out into the future, and they're both not the same issue, truthfully, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12455)|
| 3:27:44| The mayor is dealing with the current state of affairs and trying to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12464)|
| 3:27:50| and MPC is saying we need a general plan for a bigger, broader future look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12470)|
| 3:27:58| We're not sure what that scope is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12478)|
| 3:28:00| but we would like to have kind of an assurance that if we do this work, we might be able to do a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| That's kind of what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12486)|
| 3:28:07| In a court of law, if your general plan contradicted and went against your urban growth policy plan, which would win?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12487)|
| 3:28:18| Your urban growth policy plan, most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12498)|
| 3:28:21| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12501)|
| 3:28:22| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12502)|
| 3:28:25| We have asked the mayor to convene the Urban Growth Policy Committee for the purpose of amending the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12505)|
| 3:28:35| How long does the other entities have to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12515)|
| 3:28:41| I think it's 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12521)|
| 3:28:45| If there is no response in 60 days, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| Well, we can go forward with an impasse to the state under mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12531)|
| 3:28:58| If that doesn't work, then we end up in court like we did the last time, and the state will tell us what it is we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12538)|
| 3:29:06| So we don't really need to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| I truly believe that the three major players, this committee of the three governmental entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12548)|
| 3:29:18| I believe they will come together and look at the mayor's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| I think they will work on that and come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12561)|
| 3:29:24| But all that has to be approved by each of the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| So it will come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| It will come back before Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| And it would be impossible for that committee to meet and come back to us with a plan by March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12572)|
| 3:29:40| Practically impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| It would be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12581)|
| 3:29:45| It would be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12585)|
| 3:29:46| We've got to wait for him to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12586)|
| 3:29:47| We asked the mayor to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| We should let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12589)|
| 3:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12594)|
| 3:29:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12595)|
| 3:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12596)|
| 3:29:57| Hey, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12598)|
| 3:29:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12599)|
| 3:30:00| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you've got a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| I'll go ahead and address it for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12602)|
| 3:30:05| But, Commissioner Smith, any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12605)|
| 3:30:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12610)|
| 3:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12611)|
| 3:30:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12612)|
| 3:30:13| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| Commissioner Anders and then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| Speaking to the substitute motion, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12617)|
| 3:30:20| First of all, Commissioner Schoonmaker said that we could have everything by the state between 30, maybe 45 days, 30 if we're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12620)|
| 3:30:29| But you're only asking to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12629)|
| 3:30:32| So then also the mayor has sent out this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| The first meeting they're going to have is in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12636)|
| 3:30:39| We don't know the direction we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| And we also, you know, MPC or Plan Knoxville, whatever it is, is in the middle of a recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12642)|
| 3:30:51| The mayor's office is in the middle of a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| Everything is going on at the very same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| When we can just sit down, they can have a meeting, then they can have a discussion with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12657)|
| 3:31:03| He doesn't need us to tell MPC to go forward with a scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12663)|
| 3:31:07| The mayor's office can tell MPC to look for a scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| There's no vote of this commission that's going to make this any faster or any slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| I'm on board with redeveloping our general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12676)|
| 3:31:19| But I think we need to wait and see what the state does with the urban growth policy, see what the group comes back together with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12679)|
| 3:31:25| That's not going to happen between now and March 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12685)|
| 3:31:28| This is hurting nothing by going to July 1st and doing it slow, deliberate, and correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12688)|
| 3:31:34| That's all my proposition does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12694)|
| 3:31:38| Be slow, deliberate, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| Because right now, this was thrown out here with a money amount on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12701)|
| 3:31:45| Now we don't need money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| There's more confusion today than there was two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12707)|
| 3:31:51| Slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| The mayor has a process that he's working through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| The state has legislation, caption bill, that they could or could not resurrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12715)|
| 3:31:59| Let it finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| This is like a golf shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12721)|
| 3:32:02| Let it finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12722)|
| 3:32:05| And so what's the hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12725)|
| 3:32:08| Everybody is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| We need a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12730)|
| 3:32:11| We want better planning for the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| There is nothing to say we can't start in July with issuing an RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12734)|
| 3:32:20| We're not in any hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12740)|
| 3:32:21| We haven't been, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12741)|
| 3:32:22| We haven't had a road plan in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12742)|
| 3:32:25| Let's do it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12745)|
| 3:32:26| Let's let the mayor's office work on the budget, work on the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| Let's let them get recode, hopefully, through city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12749)|
| 3:32:32| And then we can all start fresh in July and we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12752)|
| 3:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12758)|
| 3:32:39| I've been doing my best to keep track of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| but I believe Commissioner Biggs has not spoken on this particular subject item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12761)|
| 3:32:44| So I'd like to call in Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12764)|
| 3:32:46| I'd like to go ahead and call for the vote on the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12766)|
| 3:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12772)|
| 3:32:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12773)|
| 3:32:54| So Commissioner Biggs has called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| Mr. Law Director, do we need to have a vote to take this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12776)|
| 3:33:01| You vote to affirm the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| The discussion ceases when you call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| You vote to affirm, and then you vote on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| So you vote on the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12788)|
| 3:33:10| So to clarify for all my commissioners, all of our commissioners and anyone watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12790)|
| 3:33:16| the vote, if you vote yes, you are affirming to have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12796)|
| 3:33:22| If you vote no, you're saying do not vote on the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12802)|
| 3:33:28| To restate the motion that is before us is the substitute motion that was made by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12808)|
| 3:33:35| and seconded by Commissioner Gill, which was to postpone action on this item until the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12815)|
| 3:33:45| Your actual vote is whether to vote on the motion or continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12825)|
| 3:33:52| If you vote on the question and it is affirmed, then you shall vote on the motion without further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12832)|
| 3:33:59| If you do not, if the question fails, you're back to discussion on the last motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12839)|
| 3:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12845)|
| 3:34:06| So anyhow, we are going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12846)|
| 3:34:07| If you vote yes on this, then we will proceed immediately to taking a vote on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12847)|
| 3:34:14| Is that simplest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12854)|
| 3:34:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12855)|
| 3:34:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12857)|
| 3:34:18| Does this need to be a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12858)|
| 3:34:19| I don't know what the substitute motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12859)|
| 3:34:22| When it comes up, I can clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12862)|
| 3:34:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12864)|
| 3:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12865)|
| 3:34:26| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12866)|
| 3:34:27| We'll make this a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12867)|
| 3:34:31| We'll start with Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| If you vote yes, you call the question, then you're saying we proceed to the vote immediately on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12873)|
| 3:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=12880)|

| 3:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13074)|
| 3:37:55| What was the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| Does anyone wish to change their votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13080)|
| 3:38:01| The motion does not pass by a total of eight to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13081)|
| 3:38:07| There were three ayes and eight noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13087)|
| 3:38:10| So it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13090)|
| 3:38:11| So we're back to the original motion from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13091)|
| 3:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13095)|
| 3:38:16| I'm recognizing lights on from both Commissioner Bussler and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13096)|
| 3:38:22| Honestly, I'm not sure which light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13102)|
| 3:38:24| This is on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13104)|
| 3:38:25| I don't know who's been around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13105)|
| 3:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13106)|
| 3:38:27| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13107)|
| 3:38:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13108)|
| 3:38:29| I think Commissioner Schoenmaker has a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| However, I think the General Assembly will be thoroughly out to where that captioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13112)|
| 3:38:38| bill can't come back up until the last of April because I've heard from a bunch of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13118)|
| 3:38:44| representatives that they're going to try to get home by April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13124)|
| 3:38:49| I was going to ask Mr. Schoenmaker if he would like to say either may, put it on it may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13129)|
| 3:38:56| because that way they will be adjourned and they can't bring that bill back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13136)|
| 3:39:02| But we can start our process of developing a plan now but not really vote on any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13142)|
| 3:39:12| of money and things like this and really get going until they're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13152)|
| 3:39:17| And I think that would be May 1st is when they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13157)|
| 3:39:21| That would be by April 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| But can I just, Commissioner Bussler, my motion failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13163)|
| 3:39:28| So it's back to the original motion to have it on July's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13168)|
| 3:39:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13173)|
| 3:39:34| If we did it to make sure that they're out of office, that that captioned bill can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13174)|
| 3:39:40| rear its ugly head, would it be, you said April the 10th, but I heard people say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13180)|
| 3:39:45| may go longer for some other issues they got going, say to the May date or even the April date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13185)|
| 3:39:57| My substitute motion failed, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13197)|
| 3:40:00| It's now back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13200)|
| 3:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13202)|
| 3:40:03| I want to start working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13203)|
| 3:40:04| Well, what I want to do is I want to start working on this as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13204)|
| 3:40:06| All I was trying to do is delay, and then if we need to do another delay, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13206)|
| 3:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13209)|
| 3:40:10| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| That was just trying to make it simple, make it good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13213)|
| 3:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13214)|
| 3:40:15| Why don't we delay it until May 1st or whenever, and that way they'll be out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13215)|
| 3:40:21| We don't have to worry about that captioned bill coming up, and we can start doing whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13221)|
| 3:40:27| we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13227)|
| 3:40:28| We can do whatever we want to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| So I want to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13234)|
| 3:40:35| So to clarify, you're making a substitute motion of the original motion that the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13235)|
| 3:40:40| would be delayed action on this rather than July but to the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13240)|
| 3:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13245)|
| 3:40:46| And it's a compromise between the two, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13248)|
| 3:40:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13250)|
| 3:40:51| I just want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13251)|
| 3:40:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13252)|
| 3:40:53| Is there a second of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13253)|
| 3:40:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13254)|
| 3:40:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13255)|
| 3:40:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13256)|
| 3:40:57| Was that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13257)|
| 3:40:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13258)|
| 3:40:59| Commissioner Daley has seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13259)|
| 3:41:01| So we've got a proper substitute motion on the floor made by Commissioner Bussler and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13261)|
| 3:41:09| seconded by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| Now moving on to discussion, next Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13271)|
| 3:41:14| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13275)|
| 3:41:16| I don't think there's any more lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13276)|
| 3:41:17| I think they're all off now, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13277)|
| 3:41:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13280)|
| 3:41:21| He's called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| So the next vote we will take is whether to restate, just like the last time, this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13283)|
| 3:41:28| be a roll call vote that will be if you vote yes, you are approving of the question call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13288)|
| 3:41:34| and we will then move to voting on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13294)|
| 3:41:37| So, Madam Clerk, would you begin the roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13297)|
| 3:41:39| The question, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13299)|

| 3:45:12| and leave here in just a second. Okay. We're back on the original motion. I know this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13512)|
| 3:45:27| is going on, but I know that we're all trying to do the right thing on this one. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13527)|
| 3:45:32| you to everyone for your patience on this one. We've had this question called, so is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13532)|
| 3:45:38| our next step. We need to have the vote on this particular motion. So go ahead and Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13538)|
| 3:45:45| Clerk, we'll go ahead and do a roll call vote if we come around. The original motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13545)|
| 3:45:49| restate it was to postpone action on this until July. Just am I clear? Is that how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13549)|
| 3:45:58| original motion was stated? That was made by Commissioner Anders and was the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13558)|
| 3:46:02| on that. Who was the second? Commissioner Smith. So go ahead. Madam Clerk. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13562)|
| 3:46:10| Nystrom. No. Commissioner Nystrom votes no. Commissioner Schoonmaker. No. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13570)|

| 3:46:19| Bussler. No. Commissioner Bussler votes no. Commissioner Beeler. Aye. Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13579)|

| 3:46:40| Smith. Yes. Commissioner Smith votes aye. Okay, does anyone wish to change their votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13600)|
| 3:46:47| Okay. Alright, I'll go ahead and announce it. It passes by a vote of 7 to 4. Okay, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13607)|
| 3:46:57| mayor recognizes Commissioner Anders. Yeah, I think through all this, I think we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13617)|
| 3:47:01| on the same page as far as what we want. And if the mayor has that meeting in March and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13621)|
| 3:47:06| wants to engage NPC to talk about a scope, I don't think there's anything illegal or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13626)|
| 3:47:13| impractical about that. So I just think to bring everybody out here every month between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13633)|
| 3:47:18| now and July is wrong to them. And there's a lot more going on with recode. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13638)|
| 3:47:23| the right thing to do. So I think we'll get to where we need to go. I just, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13643)|
| 3:47:28| need to do it right. Okay, thank you. Alright, is there any, I'm sorry, I recognize Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13648)|
| 3:47:34| Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this conversation is much larger just than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13654)|
| 3:47:40| we are just voted upon. This conversation with the county is about looking at the expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13660)|
| 3:47:47| growth and direction of this county for the next 5 to 10 years. And it will impact everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13667)|
| 3:47:53| in this room. And it is not just for one portion or constituents in the county. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13673)|
| 3:47:58| is for all of us. Alright, thank you, Commissioner Gill. And if I might say thank you to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13678)|
| 3:48:05| the commissioners. This was a, I think a split vote's a good vote. That means that everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13685)|
| 3:48:10| exercising their opinions. I've said that before. Me personally, as I've said, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13690)|
| 3:48:16| I wanted out of this was to try to give our, either way we're going to be doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13696)|
| 3:48:20| around some sort of general plan. And I wanted to, my personal belief was to try to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13700)|
| 3:48:25| our planning commission some sort of direction on helping them at least get started on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13705)|
| 3:48:32| And that may be something I bring to the next month's meeting for consideration. So now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13712)|
| 3:48:38| with that one done, moving on on our agenda, Madam Clerk. The next item is Resolution 907| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13718)|
| 3:48:45| and I'll be reading a revised caption. It is requesting the TPO to commission a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13725)|
| 3:48:51| study of the North Shore Drive corridor so that assessments and recommendations can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13731)|
| 3:48:56| made concerning development impact, safety improvements, and alleviation of traffic congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13736)|
| 3:49:03| Okay, this is a, this originally was on the consent agenda, but there was a minor change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13743)|
| 3:49:11| to it based on direction that we received from TDOT. The direction we received from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13751)|
| 3:49:17| TDOT came from Jeff, excuse me, Steve Borden. And he said, basically, and I'll read verbatim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13757)|
| 3:49:25| what Steve had said, a resolution sufficient to trigger an RFP for a traffic study of North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13765)|
| 3:49:31| Shore Drive corridor should be read as follows. Be it resolved that county commission request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13771)|
| 3:49:37| that TPO commission a traffic study of the North Shore Road corridor so that assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13777)|
| 3:49:41| can be made and recommendations can be made concerning development impact, safety improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13781)|
| 3:49:46| and you know, traffic, and alleviation of traffic congestion. We added that verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13786)|
| 3:49:52| that TDOT had suggested we add to it. Kind of the bottom line on this one is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13792)|
| 3:49:59| North Shore is a state highway and if we wanted to even add a turn lane at Wallace Road or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13799)|
| 3:50:04| to turn into Lake Shore Park, we really can't do any of that until we've gotten, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13804)|
| 3:50:11| some sort of traffic study on it. So that was some direction from TDOT to try and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13811)|
| 3:50:17| get this good hard look at. Because it's, frankly, there's so much growth out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13817)|
| 3:50:21| and it's not even on TDOT's radar. And when we brought it to them, they've said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13821)|
| 3:50:26| you need TPO to tell us to put it on our radar. So this resolution is to put it on their radar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13826)|
| 3:50:31| if that makes sense. And I apologize for making a change to it after it was on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13831)|
| 3:50:37| but that was some verbiage that TDOT told us to add. So, with that said, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13837)|
| 3:50:43| do we get a motion for approval from Commissioner Jay and is there a second from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13843)|
| 3:50:47| Skinmaker? So, all in favor, excuse me. I'll go ahead. I think we should take the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13847)|
| 3:50:54| to recognize Representative Martin Daniel for his extensive work on this with the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13854)|
| 3:51:00| Department of Transportation and then also Chairman Nystrom's work on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13860)|
| 3:51:05| So I wanted to just say thank you to both of you to get this before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13865)|
| 3:51:09| All right. Yeah. Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker. I also want to mention Andrew Roberto from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13869)|
| 3:51:14| Knoxville City Council as some of this area is within the city and we're trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13874)|
| 3:51:17| together on this particular initiative. So, with that said, is there any other discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13877)|
| 3:51:24| on this item? Okay. This motion is properly before us. So, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13884)|
| 3:51:32| All opposed, please say nay. Okay. The ayes have it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13892)|
| 3:51:38| Okay. Madam Clerk. Ordinance 0-19-1-101 is amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13898)|

| 3:52:41| motion for approval on this one? All right. Thank you. And the second was from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13961)|
| 3:52:44| Jay. I believe we do need to...this does require a roll call vote. So, Madam Clerk, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13964)|
| 3:52:51| any discussion on this item? Okay. Madam Clerk, would you please lead us in a roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=13971)|

| 3:53:40| an update of bills filed in the Tennessee General Assembly. All right. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14020)|
| 3:53:45| Schoonmaker, I know we've been trying to get this discussion done for some time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14025)|
| 3:53:48| it seems like it always falls towards the end, and we're tired. But go ahead. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14028)|
| 3:53:55| Because of the length of the meeting today, I was just going to say that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14035)|
| 3:54:01| Bussler and I, about 10 days ago, spent a day in Nashville. We reviewed 557 bills that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14041)|
| 3:54:08| affect counties in Tennessee, and I now have the 72-page list of those bills of where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14048)|

| 3:54:20| oppose or monitor those bills. So I will forward the document to the Legislative Affairs Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14060)|
| 3:54:28| tomorrow afternoon so they can review it. And then if anybody has any questions, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14068)|
| 3:54:35| be glad to answer them, what I know of them. But we could be here for a while, so. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14075)|
| 3:54:43| I saw Commissioner Daley asked you a question. He doesn't want that one. Okay. Sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14083)|
| 3:54:51| you just have to ignore him. Okay. It's the medicine he's on, so it's medication. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14091)|
| 3:54:59| mention one thing. I was very pleased that our Regional Forensic Center brought to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14099)|
| 3:55:04| attention two bills that they strongly oppose, and the Commissioners Association did vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14104)|
| 3:55:10| to oppose those bills in the General Assembly. So I appreciate that effort on the Forensic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14110)|
| 3:55:16| Center. Thank you. I'm sorry John's not here anymore to hear those good comments. I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190225?start=14116)|
