| 0:00:00| We're getting ready to start our application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| To all the applicants, you will get five minutes to tell the commission all about yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7)|
| 0:00:14| When you come up, give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=14)|
| 0:00:18| After you have your five minutes, any commissioner that would like to address you or ask you any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=18)|
| 0:00:24| that will be the time that they will get to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=24)|
| 0:00:29| Commissioners, we have 14 applicants tonight, so I'm going to try to move this along pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| I know you probably have a lot to talk about, but if you have something, please get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| But let's cut our questions short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=41)|
| 0:00:44| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| We're also going to allow people that are here tonight to make comments, are we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| After all the applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| After we get done with all the applicants and then, or should we open it up between every district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| I think it should be open up between every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| Is that okay with everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=60)|
| 0:01:02| And that way, while it's still fresh on our minds, those applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| then we can hear from what the people here tonight have to say about it, and then we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Yes, I have a special request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=73)|
| 0:01:16| One of the applicants in the second district, Mark Campin, presides over the Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| and their meeting is at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| So I would ask that he be prepared to go out of order and speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| If we have no objections, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Would we like to maybe go ahead and just do all of the second district and then go back to the first if we're going to allow one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| It's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| The people in the audience, how long do they have to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| I thought two minutes would be plenty of time since we have so many applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| What about second district going first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| I think it would be best to allow it to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| If we're going to do it by districts, if we keep the districts together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| What's the feel of the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Second district will go first, first district second, and then the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| Mike Hammond is the only commissioner that's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| He's got a UT girls basketball game that he calls, so he will get a tape of this meeting and get to hear every interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=136)|
| 0:02:26| Second district, we have four candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| The first candidate will be Mark Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Hello, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| My name is Mark Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| I am the second district at 1309 Adair Drive, and I moved to that district in the fall of 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=165)|
| 0:02:55| and I have been encouraged to come to this interim appointment through various friends and family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=175)|
| 0:03:05| I don't want to go into full family history, but I've got some family ties to the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| My grandmother having worked there in the late 30s at the drugstore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| and my father growing up at Fountain City at the grammar school and going to Central High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| and so I just feel like it's an opportunity to represent the district and work with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=203)|
| 0:03:34| Commissioner, do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Mark, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Tell me what your number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I'm tickled to death to see your degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| I've got the exact same degree that you got from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| What's your feeling on TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Excuse me, on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| On TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| TIFs, the tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| Well, I think it can be a useful tool when used properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| You know, I think when someone wants to come in and do a certain development in a particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| that they can really help out with infrastructure and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| But, you know, I feel like it can be abused at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| and so it's good on a case-by-case basis to look at each application for that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| Mark, I'm sorry, what experience, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| or what experience do you have working with any budgets, anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| Other than within the organization I work for, the Isaac Walton League, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| and other small civic organizations like the Fountain City Town Hall, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| I can't say that I've worked on a lot of budget items such as large ones like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| but, you know, I don't really, I can't say much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| Do you have anything in particular during this appointment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| that you would like to see done for the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| anything in particular that you would like to see accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| Well, just like with any district, I think developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| and having smart growth going out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Certainly, with my background and interest in water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| I would love to see a continued effort to work towards that goal to make things better, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=323)|
| 0:05:32| and just work with the development community, like I say, to do things properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| I don't want to hog all the questions, let somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| How do you feel about the development issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| basically the property rights of a developer versus the folks who live close to that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=348)|
| 0:05:57| I mean, do you believe that the property owner should have more say in what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| or do you believe that, and I'm not talking about where they're actually going to damage someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| I'm talking about the situations we see where, you know, a neighborhood says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| you know, our neighborhood is one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| maybe you've got an older neighborhood that was built prior to sewer being ran into that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| and now that sewer is in the neighborhood, you can build at a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| and the neighbors are saying, you know, look, air houses are one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| we would prefer that these stay at one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| but the developer is there saying, you know, look, we've got sewer here now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| we can build three units per acre and do just fine with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| based on the utilities that are in the infrastructure that's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Would you be more inclined to stand up for the property rights of the person wanting the higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| or would you be more inclined to say, you know, these neighbors live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| they have a right to say what's built next door to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Well, I think any neighbors have the rights to say what they feel about a certain development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| and yes, I can respect property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| but if you have a majority of the people that live in and around that area that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| have an opportunity to voice their opinion about a particular development, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| I think it's important to listen to your neighbors in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| So, you know, general guidelines can determine, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| within certain bounds on how many units per acre can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| So I think communication is very important in that respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| to go around to the adjacent folks that live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| and have some meaningful discussion related to that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| First, I want to ask you, do you have any conflict of interest that might arise that you could think of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| Well, you know, we've worked, the Isaac Walton League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| a conservation organization that's worked with the city and the county on a variety of issues related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| oh gosh, everything from dog poop bags to the Turkey Creek Wetland Park out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| So in that respect, we don't really have any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| I don't see any money interests or conflicts in that respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| but I'm trying to think if there's anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Personally, my wife teaches at Holston Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| So your wife is a teacher within Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Another question I know that Mike Hammond would have asked if he were here is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| we're going to ask that all of those that do get the appointment to wait until everything's done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| and be sworn in at the end, and I just want to hear if you're going to, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| we don't want someone to get sworn in while we're still in the middle of the process of trying to appoint these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| Would you be willing, are you going to promise to wait until everybody is sworn in at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Another question I have is as far as taxes and within a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| I know we're going to have a very trying year this year with trying to make our budget work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=559)|
| 0:09:26| You're going to have certain pressures from the schools, you're going to have certain pressures from the library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| and do you think it's possible to try to do this budget without a tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| or could you foresee the possibility of having one and being able to vote for one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| Well, certainly we'd like to be able to do it without an increase, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| and I can't certainly point towards areas where monies would come from in a particular tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| You know, I think the education is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| and if there's monies needed in certain parts of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| then I would be amiable to looking into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| but I can't really answer on should we have a tax increase to go towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Well, I've been asking you tonight if you feel like we need one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| but once you looked at the budget, and I don't know what the mayor is going to be bringing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| but if he were to say, you know, in order to keep the libraries open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| in order to keep the school system funded, it would require a tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| and after you looked at the budget, if that's what it took, could you vote for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| Yes, I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Commissioner Moore-Carman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Mark, I know you do your work at Fountain City Town Hall, but others may not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| so I would just ask you to reflect for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| There are three other applicants, Kendall Wells, Chuck Williams, and Robert Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| You may not know them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| You may know them a bit, but what personal characteristic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| or experience do you think elevates you above them and would make you the better choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Well, I've been involved with the Town Hall organization since the beginning of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=671)|
| 0:11:22| and, you know, I've been able to work with that group on a variety of issues related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| well, pretty much all in the city, but, you know, I've been encouraged through them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| and felt like they feel like I can have certain leadership potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| to rise to the chair position within that group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| and work with the citizens of Fountain City and the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| So, you know, I feel like I can bring a really honest, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=708)|
| 0:11:56| approach to looking at things in both sides of particular issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| I like to hear both sides before, you know, trying to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| or bring any personal opinions into a certain issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| So I feel like I would be a good representative and ombudsman for the people in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=737)|

| 0:12:31| Well, at the time, I really wasn't interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| There was a lot going on with other candidates that were running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| and really I wanted to kind of let, with the previous year's events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=761)|

| 0:13:22| I would have to take an independent stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| You know, we're looking at if you vote conservatively or liberal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| That's just what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=811)|

| 0:18:54| For whatever reason, the police would not move on him because the district attorney would not let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| When I finally threatened through the media that I was going to hold a press conference denouncing the district attorney's office, the person was arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1141)|
| 0:19:11| He is incarcerated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| We also had a situation while y'all were doing the Sunshine Law trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| A woman contacted me in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| She said her nephew died in sheriff's custody, and she was in the process of suing the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| I asked her to give me a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| I made a couple of phone calls, and believe it or not, ever since I ran last January, when I called an office and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| this is Chuck Williams, they listened, and they responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| The young man was released from sheriff's custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| He had several diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| I'm not going to go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| He had a convulsion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| A sheriff's deputy happened to find him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| I was contacted about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I'm also a member of the Friends of Murphy Library Committee, and I started writing the mail, making a lot of noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| The library is still there, still under staff, still under manned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| The hours are still short, but the library is still there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| That's something I want to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Mr. Williams, I'm going to ask you the same question for Mike Hammond, since he can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Would you promise to not take your oath of office until everybody else waits until after everybody has been appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1253)|
| 0:21:01| I'll be standing in the middle of the room with the rest of the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| I appreciate you doing that, and I appreciate everybody else making that same promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| How do you feel about land use issues, zoning issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| When someone comes forward and they want a piece of property rezoned, the 2nd District being wholly contained within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| you won't have any zoning issues come before you as a commissioner from the 2nd District, because they'd all be handled by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| But you still get to vote on zoning issues in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| How do you feel about when someone brings forth a zoning issue and there's opposition from the neighbors, how would you rectify that difference in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1297)|
| 0:21:49| First off, like you said, it probably wouldn't happen in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| Let's say District 6, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| I would go and meet the people of District 6 and find out what their opposition was to that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| Then I would think to myself and look at the situation as to whether it really made sense, not only for District 6, but for the county itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1327)|
| 0:22:17| How is it going to affect the county as far as income and money for taxes, whether it's a business or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| If it made sense for the county and it was not going to harm people's properties or people would be in eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1345)|
| 0:22:35| I would not have a problem with voting for that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| But if it didn't make sense or if it was going to harm people, then I would probably have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| And how do you feel about budgetary issues as far as taxes and making sure that libraries, schools, and other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| like schools, parks, Sheriff's Department, they're all funded properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| I know everybody wants to make sure we're not wasting money, but if it came down to it, could you vote for a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1379)|
| 0:23:09| If it made sense, I wouldn't just arbitrarily vote for a tax raise just to increase taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| It would have to make sense, let's say in this case it was the school board, they would have to really show where that money is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1394)|
| 0:23:27| and why that tax increase was needed before I would go ahead and vote for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| I would have to really know it made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| You mentioned your community and your enthusiasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| Is there any conflict of interest that you would have that you could think of that is out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| None of my relatives, the only ones that are here, I just recently got married a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| My wife and her family do not work for the county or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| My daughter is a student at Tennessee Tech, finally after all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| No relatives, no friends that I know of that work for the county or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Like I said, I'm a substitute teacher, but that's just something I'm doing to get experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| If that presented itself as a problem, it's not a problem. I wouldn't substitute teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| We just want to get it out there. So you just got married?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Five months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| I knew that she was asking me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| It's been a pleasure to get to know you during the campaign and before that, Chuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Let me just ask you, you may, in the course of your campaigning, run across the other applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| Mr. Campin, Mr. Wells, Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| What personal characteristic or experience elevates you above them where you should be the choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| One, I have no ties with anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| People like yourself, Commissioner, Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| I've only seen you all if I happen to be like when we was at Widdle Middle Springs or like Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| I first met him at Channel 10 last year when he was checking resumes when they first started the appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| Same thing with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| So I have no ties to nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| I don't have ties to any organizations per se as far as within the county or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| So no one can say I owe them or they owe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| Also, I have been out there campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| And I've talked to the people of District 2 and I know what the concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| I know what the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| I know what the problems were that made me first seek the office of District 2 Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| So I think that's what sets me apart from everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| I've been out there and actually met all the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| Longer than they know me or they heard of Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| She was a UT swimmer and that's big here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| I have no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| But people are starting to know who I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Robert Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| I'm Bob Wolfenbarger, 3200 Lexanne Lane, Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| First of all, I want to proudly say I'm a father and a grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| And I'm a lifelong resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| I've lived 15 years in the Alice Bell Spring Hill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| As the resume that you have will indicate, for many years I've been doing community oriented things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1623)|
| 0:27:13| to try to make our community better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| And I think that gives me some experience that should help in this job that I'm applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Previous, or not previous to, but I've worked for 30 years in the automobile industry in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| Most recently at Rusty Wallace Honda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| I've managed multi-million dollar inventories and budgets, so I understand budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| And I would certainly look forward to scrutinizing Knox County's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| I'm engaged in issues such as education, land use, policy, water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| environmental conservation, and historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| But in the resume, once again, that I gave you, it will indicate specifically what those involvements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| And some people ask me why I do these things, and I do these things because I am a grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| And I want to provide a better place for my kids to grow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| and my grandkids to grow old than I currently live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| And I think I can bring to the table some thoughts and ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| and concepts that will improve those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| And why do I do it? I do it because it's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and I do it because it's my obligation as a citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| Some people ask me, what would you like to accomplish while you're on county commission in a short period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| And I think the first thing that I would like to help do is bring some stability and credibility to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| Secondly, I think I can help bring some real world business experience as far as budgets are concerned to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| I can help encourage the public to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| And I think if you look at my resume, I've done that for more than a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| encouraging people to engage in the process of being involved in their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| And fourthly, but probably as important as anything I'd like to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| I'd like to help start the conversation or discussion about creating a comprehensive master plan for land use in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Yeah, you've mentioned land use. Would you consider yourself more pro-development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| And I guess what I'm trying to say in this is if you've got a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| that's going to be longer so that it's going to flood the neighbor's basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| if it just simply comes down to density, that the neighbors would prefer that things stay as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| or that density remains similar to the other developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| When it comes down to situations like that, it's fundamentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| do you believe that the property owner should have more say in how a piece of property is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| or do you believe that the community as a whole should have more say in the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| I guess from a business standpoint, do you prescribe to the stakeholder principle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| as in anyone who is in any way close to it should have some say in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| or the stockholder principle, where the person that actually owns that piece of property should have more say in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| And again, I'm not talking about where someone's going to do something on their land that's going to damage me on my land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| I'm talking about just where it's, I would prefer that everything stay more rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| but the property owner wants to become more suburban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Which way are you going to fall in those circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| Well, the first thing I'd like to do would be engage the community and the landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| in a conversation between them and see if they can work out the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1859)|
| 0:31:06| I think the next most important thing is I'd like to see what the guiding principles are of our land use policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| In other words, for the sector plan, I want to know what our land use professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| together with the community, deemed appropriate for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| It's a complex issue, but I think that that's one reason that I would like to start the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| about developing a comprehensive master plan for land use in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| so that we can avoid some of these conflicts, put development in the appropriate place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| maybe ultimately even providing incentives to those speculators that want to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| those developers that want to buy land for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Maybe we should be trying to help them develop in the appropriate area that has already the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| and is deemed by the professionals and the planners and even the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| as an appropriate place to place that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I would ask you the same question again for Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Would you promise to not take your oath of office if you're appointed until everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| I wouldn't have considered it under any circumstances to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| I appreciate that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| How do you feel about TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| I think TIFs are, based on how I understand them, and if I'm wrong, I certainly will be corrected in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| But the way I understand them now, they're designed to encourage development in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| that would not otherwise have that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| And if that is, in fact, the way that they're supposed to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| that's the way I would want to see them used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Mr. Wolfenbarger, are you involved in any lawsuit against Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Would you describe a little bit what your lawsuits are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I exercised my rights in the Democratic Society to file a suit with 16 other Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| against Commissioner Moore and Commissioner Pingston for a potential perjury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| that they may have committed under the Sunshine Act lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Is there a lawsuit against the Midway property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| I'm not personally involved in that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| You've heard me ask it twice before, but let me try to get the wording exactly the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| What personal characteristic, skill, or experience raises you above the other three applicants that we know of so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| You know, that's a difficult question because I've met Mr. Williams and I know Mr. Kampen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| and they're both absolutely, and frankly, I don't know the kindle, but they're absolutely fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| And personally, I don't know that I'm elevated above them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Now, as far as personal experience with land use issues, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| some of the issues that I rattled off a minute ago, you know, let me look at my list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| Land use policy, water quality, and I have to qualify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| For Mr. Kampen, he probably knows more about water quality than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| But as far as environmental conservation, historic preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| those things I've been working diligently at and my resume reflects the details of that for more than ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| So I would suspect that if you have to answer that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| I'd have to say that I probably have more experience in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you, Mr. Wilbarger, for being willing to serve your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| Speak to some educational issues that you think are important or maybe pertain to your district in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| Education specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Well, unfortunately, in my district or adjacent to my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| I have two schools by national standards and state standards that are failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| And that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| I also live in a neighborhood, as most of you on the commission will know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| that is a lower economic standard than the average through the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| so therefore we have children that have other challenges other than just education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| But those challenges impact their ability to learn and their opportunity to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| So education is a very complex subject, but I was involved recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| The motivating factor that got me involved in the education issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| was that I was involved in this rezoning issue recently at the request of some of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| and some other people I know throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| And the question that I had for the school board at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| to give you an idea of my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| was how is the rezoning of all these Niles County students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| going to positively impact their ability to learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| And frankly, I couldn't understand how that would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| So is my level of understanding of education at the level that land use policy is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| But do I have a strong concern and inclination to want to do more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Mr. Wolfenbarger, why didn't you run for the office on February the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| I'm sorry, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Why didn't you run for the office on February the 5th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I didn't run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| I said why didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Why did you not run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Oh, why did I not run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Frankly, in our district, I think we were probably one of the most fortunate districts in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| maybe not the most, but I think prejudicially the most fortunate district in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| in that we had two fabulous candidates, and that's not excluding Mr. Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| because I didn't know him that well, but I knew the other two ladies that were running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| and they were just absolutely fabulous candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| And to follow through on that, the reason that I'm here now is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| I want to be the caretaker that gets us to the August elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and allows the appropriate winner of that campaign to take office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| and carry on with hopefully some of the quality things that the interim appointees will help get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2249)|
| 0:37:37| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Mr. Wolfenbarger, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Now we have time for any person from the second district that would like to come down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| You will have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| And all the applicants, don't forget to go over and pick up the chancellor's court order before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| My name's Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I live at 4606 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| I'm president of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| have been for close to 17, 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| We've been in existence 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I've been president for close to 17 years of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| On Thursday, February the 7th, I received a couple of calls telling me that no one had signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| seeking the appointment for the second district county commission seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| I was asked if I was interested by one of the callers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| I do not have the time to devote to the job as it needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I was then asked if I could suggest someone by both callers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| The first name that came to me was Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Bob and I have been acquainted for about 14 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| He's been a valuable member of the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association since he joined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| He has served as vice president for many years until he had some health problems that caused him to give it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| He still remains on the board of directors and is still very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| I cannot tell you how many times Bob has been the mainstay in some of our fights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| to keep our communities the best that they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2355)|

| 0:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| I'm actually talking about the second district, but I don't live in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| And I think the way you phrased it, it kind of sounded like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| I'm just here to also support Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2571)|

| 0:43:02| And I think that he would be an excellent interim commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| And I would urge you to consider him because he is very fair-minded and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2591)|

| 0:43:19| Seeing none, we will move to the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Mr. Chairman, I have a question for Mr. Wolfenbarger, one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Am I allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Mr. Wolfenbarger, since you've entered into a lawsuit against two of the members of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| could you address that as an issue if you were appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| I mean, that seems to be kind of a staunch obstacle maybe here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| So just at least speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| If you were selected, how would you propose to avoid more conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2630)|
| 0:43:58| and more instability and dysfunction than we seem to have in the present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2638)|
| 0:44:07| First of all, I can say that the lawsuit is not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| It's about principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| It's about philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| It's about doing and saying the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| It's not something that I would raise with either of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| It's not an issue that I would be interested in discussing in a formal setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| Based on the Sunshine Law, there's not going to be a whole lot of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| for Commissioner Moore, Pinkston, and myself to interact personally together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| So I don't personally see it as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Now, if hurt feelings is an issue with either of them, I regret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| This is about democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| It's about having open and fair government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| It's about being able to exercise my democratic rights to that form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2702)|
| 0:45:11| And I certainly hope I'm not penalized because I'm an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| for open and fair government in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| I'm happy to address any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you, Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2727)|

| 0:45:53| 1536 Cliffside Lane in Holston Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| I contested for this seat not because I want to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| I ran for the seat because I believe that my district needs change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| My district has to go to the people, the majority of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| not just some few people who feel that they control and own the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| Majority of the people in the first district believe in the government of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| by the people, for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I don't see that because we have few people who try to control that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| That's why I ran for the seat, and that's why I'm running as a Republican candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| I also believe that it's wrong for this panel to appoint someone who is running in the general election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2805)|
| 0:47:00| to serve as an interim commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| I feel it's totally wrong for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| I feel that if we need someone to act as an interim person for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| we should have an independent person who is not running for the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2835)|

| 0:48:26| Well, I belong to Town Hall East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| I belong to that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2912)|

| 0:49:08| they should appoint someone who's not running for the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=2948)|

| 0:50:03| It's not about a few group of people who believe that they own and control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3003)|

| 0:50:28| But I don't want you to appoint me as a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| And I put my resume up there because I want to make this statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| and I want you to look at the broad picture, the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3036)|

| 0:50:45| if there's another candidate running against that person in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3045)|

| 0:51:35| If you appoint me as a caretaker for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| it creates an undue advantage for me against my opponent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| And I don't think that is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3104)|

| 0:53:36| Yeah, he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Yeah, he's on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3218)|

| 0:53:46| Just a quick question, Mr. Baugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| You were on the ballot solo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| You won the Republican primary, and you will be on the ballot in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| in a very unusual don't-appoint-me speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| that you said that you thought that this would be an advantage to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| Considering the large number of candidates who have won their primaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| and chosen not to seek appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| do you consider the possibility that maybe the commission's blessing might actually not be an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| and could in some minds be a disadvantage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| I think it would be a disadvantage to the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| if someone who wins seeks the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Rephrase your question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| I'm just saying so many persons who won their primaries chose not to seek our blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| chose not to seek the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| chose not to be associated with us until the voice of the voters is heard in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| And I'm thinking maybe that's a sign that the interim appointment by this body is not necessarily an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| but actually could be considered a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Oh, yes, I believe in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I believe it would be a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| We've gone this far without anybody taking care of those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| And so what is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I thought I heard you say in your speech that appointing the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| either you or Mr. McKenzie, would be an advantage to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| No, it would be an advantage to a person who gets appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| If I'm appointed, I have an undue advantage over him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| And so I don't want the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| I've heard advantage and disadvantage from you within the span of one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| The disadvantage, whoever doesn't get appointed will be at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Thank you, Mr. Baum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Thera Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3338)|
| 0:55:48| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| My name is Thera Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| I live at 3741 Catawba Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| I respectfully request that you consider me for the interim appointment to the first district seat A on the board of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| I understand that this appointment will only be until September 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| As you know, I was a candidate for this seat in the most recent primary election in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| Although I lost, I believe there are two profound issues in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| First is to fill the vacancy in District 1 until September with a qualified person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| Second issue is not to fill the vacancy with a candidate that has yet to win the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| We all now realize that elections can't be predicted in Knox County this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| And to assume a winner is a disservice to the citizens that have yet to vote for their commissioner beyond the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3403)|
| 0:56:52| I care about the first district and I want to be a caretaker until someone is elected for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| I am aware of the issues which have been demonstrated by my involvement over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| The position as a member of Knox County Board of Commissioners requires that a person understand how county government should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3424)|
| 0:57:13| I understand budgets, working relationships, all nine districts in Knox County, and the effect that my vote will have countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3433)|
| 0:57:22| These are my attributes that I possess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| I have no conflicts of interest and I have no relatives that work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| I welcome the opportunity to represent the citizenry of my district and all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3451)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Okay. Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Ms. Cox, how do you feel about TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| I feel that TIFs can be a great advantage when used in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| I believe that they should be scrutinized and that they should be planned so that they will be of benefit to the community where they're going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3480)|
| 0:58:10| And how do you feel about land use issues, zoning issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| I feel that land issues are very important, especially in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| I've worked on several projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Number one, blighted projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| And number two, I also attended several meetings for the five-year plan in my district in which KCDC had said that they were going to do certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3504)|
| 0:58:35| and improve the land development in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| Okay. Of course, you know, sitting on commission, you wouldn't have any land use issues from your district because they'd be handled by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3519)|
| 0:58:48| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| How do you feel about land use issues out in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| I feel the land issues out in the county should be scrutinized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| I was here at county commission the last meeting when you talked about the TIFs that were going to be used in the halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| I considered that very serious, and I asked myself, how would I vote on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| So I'm very aware of how the land development issues are with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| And Mike Hammond's question is, would you promise to not take the oath of office until all the appointments are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| and you take it with everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Would you make that promise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Yes, Ms. Cox, I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| We've met several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| And since you have been on the campaign and you went out and had a platform, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| what is the two things that most interest you in the priorities in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| The two main issues that are priorities in my district at this particular time is public safety and workforce training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3588)|
| 1:00:02| Any ideas on how that you would go about to work on those two issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I think that we need to consider more ordinances that would improve the public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Number one in particular is the parking on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| I have observed that we do not have an ordinance that is followed in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| in which tells the people that you can only park on one side of the street in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| Therefore, if you go on that street, you have to drive down the middle, which is very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| We have already had one death in our community because of that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| I think that it's something that we can work on as far as public safety is concerned with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| The second thing as far as workforce training, I think the county needs to consider more workforce training for our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| so that they can go to work and they can provide an income and therefore provide housing for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3658)|
| 1:01:08| I appreciate your answers and you being here tonight and stepping forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Ms. Cox, I've heard an awful lot about you in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| A lot of people have said a lot of really nice things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| While working in the community, what are you most proud of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Give me an example of a thing or two that you really tickled that you were able to be involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| or that you chaired and got taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| There's two things that I'm most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| The first thing is the opportunity to come back to the district and organize the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| so that I can pass communication and provide training to the people so that they can understand how government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| The second thing that I'm most proud of is the opportunity that I did have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| to train some of the disadvantaged and disenfranchised citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| They are now working members of Knox County in which they pay taxes and I believe that they are going to do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3721)|
| 1:02:09| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Have you had any experience working with budgets of this magnitude before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Yes, I've had several experiences working with budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| My experience working with budgets starts back in 1984 when I was employed with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| Since that time I have been a member of several boards and citizen organizations in which we had budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3744)|
| 1:02:32| I'm also a member of the Partnership for Neighborhood Improvement in which we have a budget that we have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| So I'm very familiar with budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I also have picked up a copy of the county budget in which I have read thoroughly and I understand it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Thank you, Ms. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| Pete Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3779)|
| 1:03:14| I want to say thank you for allowing me to appear before you this evening or tonight, whatever it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| They start to run together when you're in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| I'm here for several reasons, but the main reason is the process is just critical with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3806)|
| 1:03:38| I got involved in community action back during the civil rights struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| And the thing that was more important than anything else is to have one process that applied to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| And when I heard that somebody who had been involved in the election of February the 5th was applying for this interim position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3834)|
| 1:04:10| I thought that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| I had at that time not intended to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| But let me give you a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| When I came back to Knoxville, I served on the Community Action Committee Board of Directors on their administrative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| I served on the Metropolitan Planning Commission for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| I served on that administrative committee and I understand the process of weighing the desires of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3872)|
| 1:04:41| to protect their rights as homeowners along with businesses who would like to expand and provide jobs and opportunities for people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3881)|
| 1:04:52| I served on the old county court squire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| I served three terms, dealt with all kinds of budgets in one of those chairs as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| It was right over there where I used to be with Dr. Hardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| I served in the legislature for three terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| I cast a deciding vote for Lamar Alexander's Better Schools Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| It was going to fail without me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| I passed that one cent sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| $366 million went into education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| So I have the experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| I'm committed to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| I have a history of involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| I serve where some of you are sitting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| But the thing that is foremost in my mind than anything else is to take one candidate and give him an advantage over somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3942)|
| 1:05:56| And you will hear I heard someone say the other day that I lost the election fair and square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| They beat me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| No question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Even though I finished second, I lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| But those of us who didn't win got nearly 58% of the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| So the person who won got 42%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| So he doesn't have a majority of the votes, but we'll be able to decide that in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| And that's as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| And I appreciate your consideration for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| I'll take any questions from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| That was my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| I apologize, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I'll ask one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Pete, do you have any conflict of interest out there that you can think of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| I have a son who works for the highway department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| He's been there about 20-some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| The county or the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| The county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| So if I had to vote on anything that dealt with that area, I would do as I had to do when I was in the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| and that would be to announce my conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Commissioner Luther has a few questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| I was going to let you ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| They can go ahead and start looking right at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| Mr. Drew, do you promise to, if you are appointed, to not take your oath of office until everybody has been sworn in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4043)|
| 1:07:33| and you do it with everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| I would consider anything other than that as a violation of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| And I'm real tough on that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| I appreciate your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| And how do you feel about TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| I think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| As a matter of fact, I've got some positions where we can use it, down the Magnolia Corridor, the Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| We've got plenty of areas where you can put that to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| and we'd be glad to get in there with you and help you figure out the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| And how do you feel about land use issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| I think you have to balance, as I said in my statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| I think you have to balance the rights of the citizens to protect their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| But at the same time, you have to consider businesses that provide jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4101)|
| 1:08:29| And so there has to be a happy medium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| I've been here when people would say, I wake up in the morning and I look out my window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| and I see those trees over there and I love them and I don't think we ought to destroy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| I don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| But at the same time, you don't do it willy-nilly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| and you don't just come out here and build something because you may have a vote to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| I hope I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you, Mr. Drews, for your past service to the community and your willingness to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| Would you refresh my memory about the vote totals in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| Obviously Mr. McKenzie is seeking to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| and I can't quite remember how the percentages broke down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| and it seems like you're fairly familiar with that and I don't remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| As I remember, reading the paper, Mr. McKenzie got 42 point some percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| And glory to him, I wish I had got the 42 point some percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| So I'm not trying to put that down at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| But there were other candidates who ran and between us we got 57 point some percent of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| So it's not just to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| But individually, what were the other percentages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Do you know those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| I think I got 22 percent or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| I've got those, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| If you want me to just rattle those out for you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Yeah, if you've got them, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Teresa Cox, 15 point 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Pete Drew, 21 point 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Evelyn Gill, 8 point 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Samuel McKenzie, 42 point 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| And Cynthia Stancil, 11 point 32 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Go ahead, Mr. Drews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| You were finishing your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Well, I was just going to say, if Mr. McKenzie had gotten 60 percent of the vote in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4222)|
| 1:10:32| that would not justify giving him the advantage of incumbency by running when he has to run again in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4232)|
| 1:10:42| It wouldn't be fair to Mr. Barr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| I mean, it just happened to be him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| It could have been anybody else, anybody around this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| It's not just and it's not fair to give somebody that kind of advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4251)|
| 1:11:02| Mr. Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I'll wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I'm just wondering how one can look at the last election returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| and argue that incumbency is necessarily an advantage currently in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| That may change, but how can one argue that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Well, because if you had been on this commission and making those kinds of decisions prior to the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4280)|
| 1:11:29| I don't think it would have been an advantage to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| But in light of the fact that Mr. McKenzie had not served on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| if it had been a disadvantage, he would not have won the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| So his name recognition and wonderful family and great brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| I don't know about sisters, but I know his twin brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| They used to be in the daycare where I worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| But I know him as a great young man, and I tried to beat him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| Obviously, I'm not for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| But what I'm trying to say is in light of the fact that he had not served here during the turmoil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4323)|
| 1:12:11| that would then act as an advantage for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| And I hope I make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| If not, I'll go with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| I'll try it one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| I've got something of an answer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Pete, one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| If you're appointed to this, it's only seven meetings from February through August there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| What would you like to see accomplished in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| Is there anything that you feel that you can actually get accomplished for the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| First, let me tell you what I think is the most critical thing that's going to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| and that is putting those initiatives on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| I want to say this to this commission because we have more interest in county government now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| than we've had that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| And I just want to, with everything that's in me, do not reduce the number of people on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4385)|
| 1:13:15| Don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| We're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| You don't want county government to make them work smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I know how people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| If we can do this, it will be smooth, and the fewer people you have to deal with, these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| That is not what government is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| It's not to make it smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It's to make it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| And because somebody else messed it up or somebody didn't do it right or whoever you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| people ought to vote you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| But you shouldn't change the total process and make it fewer people participating in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| just because somebody else decided that that's not how it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| Now, what can I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I can argue forcibly for that particular position that I just brought to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| And there are other things in there that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| They should all be considered one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| They shouldn't be lumped all in together to where what would happen is if you took one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| you'd have to take them all, or if you didn't like one, you'd have to reject them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| But they should be one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| You all should put them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| I don't want to take your position because I've already been told that I want to stay in my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| But you asked me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| And what I think would happen would be that those things should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| And there will be some specific things that I'll talk to you once I'm done with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4478)|
| 1:14:45| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4489)|

| 1:15:21| It's good to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4521)|

| 1:15:31| Let me first deal with the 100,000 pound elephant Mr. Barr brought into the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| I, unlike Mr. Barr, chose to participate in the primary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| We had nine plus public speaking engagements, radio dates, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| I was out there actively engaged, listening to what the people wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| And so the whole process that brought us here today, if you apply the previous people's logic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4556)|
| 1:16:09| should have been done and could have been done in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| You all chose to delay this process until after the February primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| and to get a strong sense of what the people wanted or who the people wanted to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| And that's why we're doing this on today and not on December whatever date that came forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4585)|

| 1:17:07| I was a founding member of the First Tee Program at the Wii course at Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4627)|

| 1:17:34| And I'm also a board member of the Knoxville Football Officials Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| I've been extremely active with fundraising for Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| An organization that I'm a member of has chosen to dedicate our efforts and our fundraising abilities to raise $50,000 for Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4663)|
| 1:17:55| The reason we did that over a 10-year period, the accrediting agencies and the like came and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| we need to understand that the people of Knoxville want Knoxville College to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| So that's why we undertook that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| The Magnolia Avenue corridor is a vital link and needs our care and feeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4694)|
| 1:18:21| Some public, some private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| A majority private, but it does need some serious care and feeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| It's a great corridor into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| The traffic counts, in my estimation, dictates that there should be more development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| So that's one of my goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| One of my overarching goals is to restore the trust and integrity in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| And I want to do that with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| This can be done by processes like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| This open and honest deliberation process is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| Knoxville is a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| It has great natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| We have to leverage these strengths with responsible growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| I work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| I've been working there since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| I work at the Spallation Neutron Source there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| But I've always lived in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| I make that trek across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Because I love the First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| That's where I put my time and my talents and my heart and my family in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| So I have been active my entire adult life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| This is more than just an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| This is just the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| I've always been active in furthering the First District efforts, not just in East Knoxville, but Mechanicsville, Holston, downtown areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4773)|
| 1:19:43| I served on the city's Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| And I may answer a question that may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| The Industrial Development Board has pilots, payments in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Is that a good thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| It's been a great thing for downtown, the housing component downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| It's also been a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| One was given to the Knoxville News Sentinel to build their property in Knoxville, in the center of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| where they could have gone on to an outside area or, heaven forbid, to another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| But, okay, they got a tax break over a 10-year period for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| That did two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| That kept a major employer here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| But it also, if you look at that Western Avenue corridor, it's done great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| We have a food city there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| That, combined with the HOPE VI project, has been a great thing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| So some of the other things I've been active with, I was on a task force for the Casual Park development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4834)|
| 1:20:45| when they decided to go away from the kind of traditional municipal football field, softball field complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| to more of a quad and bring in the YMCA and make more of a green space with the Ashley Nicole Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| I've been active with science, math, and tutoring sciences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| I'm a physics major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| I started out in research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| I've been active with science and tutoring at Vine Middle Magnet over the past year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| Again, in closing, let me say I have dedicated my adult life to both professional, family, and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4874)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Are there any questions for Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I'd like to ask you about the land use issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Again, we take a situation where someone's not going to be physically damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| It's just basically they would prefer the neighborhood stay rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| but the property owner wants to put in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| How are you going to side on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Are you going to look out for the property rights of the person who wants to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| or are you going to look more at the, well, the neighborhood has a right to stay a rural neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4913)|
| 1:22:01| Well, you know, it all depends on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| It's really going to be a case-by-case situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| As I say, we have natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| That's why businesses and entities like to locate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| But at the same time, we have to be careful how we grow, you know, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4933)|
| 1:22:23| You know, I'm going to listen to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| You know, there's just one small example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| On the Dangers Avenue Association, there was a desire to build a laundromat that emptied out into kind of a residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4952)|
| 1:22:41| and they needed some kind of zoning change on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| In that particular situation, that was a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| In another area, a laundromat would be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| So it just all depends on where we are and what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| And this next question is for Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| If you don't mind my asking this, you live in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| I've heard all of these candidates, some wonderful applicants that have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| Is there any that you prefer over the other, or are you willing to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| I mean, I can't ask you this in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Is there any of these, you know, that you prefer, a group of them maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=4998)|
| 1:23:26| I'm not going to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Not going to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| I think it may be more appropriate to make those comments to the actual meeting on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| We'll have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| But not in this setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| That was loaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| I've been waiting on one from you, Luffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| We've not done the sixth district yet, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| You can get him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I'll let Mr. Lambert finish up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| I'm going to ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Do you promise to not take your oath of office if you're so appointed until the process is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| and everybody is to be sworn in at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| I assume that you are in favor of TIFs, granted your position with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| And it's a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| I think we need to fully understand what TIFs are for, what they're not for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| But in general, when it makes sense, when it does aid a development that everyone is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| and it meets the criteria, yes, I'm for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Commissioner Ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Sam, I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| One thing, like me, you have a job in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| and probably one of the questions that has or will come up is how do you balance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| and do you have the flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| It seems that you're really involved now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| but how do you balance that and the flexibility with the cost of taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| Well, that's a real good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| And, in fact, one thing I didn't bring up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| I spent five years as a commissioner for the Knoxville Utilities Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| and they have meetings in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| U.T. Battelle, my employer, has a civil service, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| clause that they allow us to serve in public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Jim Hackworth is a state representative and works at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| My former associate division director is a Rome County commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| I talked it over and actually got a congratulatory message from Dr. Tom Mason, our lab director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5144)|
| 1:25:52| So they fully support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Can you answer my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Thank you also, Mr. McKenzie, for your willingness to serve and step forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| We've talked a little bit about the advantages and disadvantages of seeking an appointment for the person that's also running for the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5167)|
| 1:26:17| So would you just address that, given the totals, the results of the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| and reemphasize, I guess, why you think it's good for your community to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| And I'll try to answer Commissioner Harmon's question that he's been asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| Well, I tend to agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| I'm not running for incumbency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| That's not why I am seeking this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| When I say running, I mean seeking this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| In fact, it may be a negative, but I feel felt all alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| I'm the best candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| I'm the best person for this seat today, December, September of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| So another way to look at the numbers, if you looked at them, Commissioner Smith called them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| I right at doubled up on the second place person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| Yeah, we have five people running, and I received right at 43% of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| I think that is a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| I think it's a strong statement in terms of numbers, in terms of percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| I think I am the people's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| I'm going to continue to run as I was in the month of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| But, again, there's a budget process coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| There's all kinds of things that I'm ready to get started to dig in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| and to help you all govern this great county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Tank, I've got a little question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| He brought it up just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| You may know it, or Scott, you may know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| I just want the people at home to know this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| is that the people that we appoint here will serve, and they're finished basically on expired terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| So as I understand it, they can still run for two terms after this and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| so they could virtually serve a ten-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| My understanding, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| Just one people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| More like a nine-year period, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| No, it would be ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Are there any other questions for Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| We're moving on to the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| We have people from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| Bill Young, 1718 Clinch, Apartment 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| My fellow Knox Countians, it is an honor to stand before this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| in which the presiding officer is my friend of many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| but more importantly, a friend of the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I thank you, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Mr. Chairman, members of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| election day at the Fort Sanders precinct over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| I asked my fellow citizens to join me and vote for Sam McKenzie for county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| They agreed, and Sam won the precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| Tonight, I am proud once again to ask my fellow citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| to vote for honest, effective leadership for the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| Commissioners, please vote Sam McKenzie, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5393)|
| 1:30:03| Shirley Nash-Pitts, 5205 East Sunset Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate you as my commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| but I know that it's hard being one commissioner in a two-commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| And Mr. Sam, I have encouraged him to seek this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| He was really undecided whether to seek the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| or to wait until after the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I have nothing against the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| They're all fine individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| But I think in our district and the other districts too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| we need our commissioners on there now because, as Sam said and others have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| we've got a budget coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| The county has been in turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| I just think that if we have the people in place that are going to be there come September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| that we're going to be in a better position as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| I urge you to please appoint Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Ms. Pitts, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| Oh, you can ask me a question, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| I didn't mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| I just hit it by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| But you did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| Will you swear to be sworn at 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| She may not want to be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I could have applied for this, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| And then what would you have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| I'd sit beside you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Thank you, Ms. Pitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5490)|
| 1:31:42| Bart Carmichael, 411 Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| It's down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| One, I'm with Albert and Peter on the I really think that you should appoint people that are not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| in this position or not running for this position in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| I just think it offers an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| It's an advantage that we can come and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| And the disadvantage has already been vetted out in the recent election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5526)|
| 1:32:14| I think that this now offers an advantage to whoever gets appointed to this if they're running in the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5534)|
| 1:32:22| And the other thing is, this is also for Mr. Strickland and for our two candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| I'm in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5548)|
| 1:32:29| That is actually part of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| Don't see many of the people running for this election downtown except for official things like this or for when there's community forums and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5552)|
| 1:32:43| I would like to see you guys show up down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| This neighborhood is part of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| So I'm inviting all of you to come downtown more often when it's not official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5570)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| With five candidates coming up, can we take a five-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| We have someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Oh, we have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| My name is Patricia Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5595)|

| 1:33:21| And I strongly urge you all to nominate Thera Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| And my reason for doing this is because I have actually seen her in her active duty in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| Most of you are probably aware of the Applewood situation where the apartments were condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5613)|
| 1:33:41| I'm also a property owner in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| I have a rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| And Ms. Cox personally assists me with the Applewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| First of all, the apartment was condemned and they were repeatedly taking the money from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| And these people didn't have any place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| So Thera Cox took it on her own to go to the legal aid at the University of Tennessee at no expense or no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5642)|
| 1:34:13| And they particularly came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| It was, I think, six of the legal aid lawyers came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| And they're the ones that got this situation rolling because of Ms. Thera Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| As far as my personal dealings with Ms. Cox, first of all, like I said, I personally have a rental property in Knoxville, more than just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5666)|
| 1:34:36| Ms. Cox personally sit with me in order to get me to go with KCDC and place these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5676)|
| 1:34:45| She had six people that she took around to different property owners in order to find a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| She had something like three weeks in order for these people to be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| She assists me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Well, first of all, we had to work on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| I was working on the property and I could not fulfill my obligations by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| She politely came to me with a friend of hers and helped me get these places ready so the people would not lose their vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5709)|
| 1:35:18| Also, at 3741 Catoppa Avenue, as far as the speed and the grass and stuff like that, Ms. Cox took it on her own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5718)|
| 1:35:29| Just like there's a lot of elderly people in that area, if you know anything about Catoppa Avenue and the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5729)|
| 1:35:38| she took it on her own to get for its lighting, which was out, that had been out for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| As far as the grass is grown, I mean, probably got about 20 or 30 complaints from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| which she had gone to the city or told me the process of what I need to do, which I was unaware of the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| And she did get that done and also the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| And, you know, so I strongly urge that you nominate Vera Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5772)|

| 1:36:27| I'm up here to advocate the process of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| I myself am a long-time standing Republican,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| but I believe that government has the right at some point to be intrusive into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5799)|
| 1:36:49| into the lives of its citizens that government was formed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| At other points, government should let the communities in which depend on government continuously run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5814)|
| 1:37:03| What I don't understand is the morphing or the changing of this body and its task of setting standards of appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5823)|
| 1:37:14| and then having candidates run and not respecting, A, either the issue of the election of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5834)|
| 1:37:23| or standing by the standard in which this body has enacted to say the appointment process would take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| It is not for me to advocate for Mr. Barr or for Mr. McKenzie in either aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| What I am advocating is that government should stand firm, and I don't believe that it has done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| We have seen over the course of the last year the back-and-forth issues of different opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5863)|
| 1:37:53| and different attitudes and people not holding firm to what has been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| I would only caution this body to stand firm to what has been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| If the issue of this body said that the numbers from the election were going to be influential in determining the candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5885)|
| 1:38:17| then that's what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| If this body had set a standard that they were going to appoint regardless of what the numbers were during the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5899)|
| 1:38:26| that's what it should stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| I do not think, and I'll say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| I do not think the government should continuously morph to standards that are too stringent for it to stand to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5910)|
| 1:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| Do you have a question, Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| I just wanted to make a comment, Deossi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| I am certainly kind of worked out a little system, and I am certainly giving the top vote getter in each district a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| I'm doing it with check marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| I'm certainly giving them an advantage because I know that more of the people in that district voted for that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| So it's not the only factor, and in some of these districts the top vote getter isn't willing to accept the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5945)|
| 1:39:13| but it is a very, very strong factor that I'm taking into consideration, and I think you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| We put off these appointments so that we would know who the top vote getter was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| and I'm going to stick to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=5969)|

| 1:40:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Well, usually when we have the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| we'll take four A and then each commissioner gets to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| or get to nominate whoever they want for that particular seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| Can we assume that all ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6062)|

| 1:41:07| Either right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Take the top two vote getters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Is that not what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6070)|

| 1:41:46| And then we can pick up with the three that are left with the B seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| So they don't have to require A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| No, they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| I don't think they need to, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Because it would be up to us to nominate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6116)|

| 1:51:47| What should be done now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Mike, are you familiar with that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| Because that is a city issue and not a county issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| I'm vaguely familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| So I just want to make sure somebody's not questioning you about something that you might not have studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| and that you might not be familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| I'm vaguely familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| I didn't get in on discussions or listen to discussions or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| but I've heard the outcry of the citizens that live around the community in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6728)|
| 1:52:17| It's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| I mean, it's an already done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| I think prior communication in the situation would have helped matters work better, I guess you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6742)|
| 1:52:31| in resolving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| It was very unfortunate the way the process went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Commissioner Lambert, that is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| but the only way I found out about it was after they got it constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| You know, KUB did not have to come to get a building permit or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| and I'm sure no one on this county commission even knew anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| That's why I thought it was in the city, because it never came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| They don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| They don't have to apply for a building permit or anything like that to a utility company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| We had no control over that whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| I knew no more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| and I'm sure every commissioner on this up here did not know anything about it until it was already erected and started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6791)|
| 1:53:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| Mike, let me ask you a couple of questions here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Do you know of any conflict of interest that you may have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| That was one of the things I run my campaign on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| I don't have any conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| I don't have any ties with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| It's only a seven-month period or set seven minutes that we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| What have you done in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| and what would you like to see in that short period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Is there anything that you could accomplish during that period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Other than my community involvement in playgrounds, baseball, football with my son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6830)|
| 1:53:59| I would like to see more park improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| I would like to see the outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| We have outcast classrooms, trailers at the Rocky Hill School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| I would like to see some kind of process started in adding a wing to Rocky Hill School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6853)|
| 1:54:20| But I know that there's other schools in the Knox County area in much worse condition than Rocky Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6860)|
| 1:54:29| and I would like to see some more, especially in the east Knoxville, south Knoxville area, school improvements made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6869)|
| 1:54:38| We've been very fortunate in the west Knoxville area to have Hardin Valley being built, Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| and the new construction built on to Cedar Bluff Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| But I would like to see more done in the south Knoxville area, in the east Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| and I'd like to help support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| What have you done out in the community to get a feel for what that community is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| Have you done any projects out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| In my district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Well, I haven't done any projects in particular other than the fact that I'm very involved in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| in my neighborhood association, very involved in my son's school, community events as far as in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6914)|
| 1:55:24| the baseball and hockey associations, also a member of the Elks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| But in learning and being involved in that, you get out into people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| and you get the sense that people want to talk to you and you listen to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| and you get a firm understanding of what they want to see their community turn into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6937)|
| 1:55:45| I'm a people person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| I just enjoy getting out and talking to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| I would like to help areas that I'd like to see improvement in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| the Small Business Administration in Knox County, the downtown west sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| and the Sutherland Avenue area, and help implementing small businesses come into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6961)|
| 1:56:09| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Mike, during your discussion of a balanced budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| I was interested to hear you talk about the tough choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| Would you consider a budget balance that relies upon or expands current county borrowing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6978)|
| 1:56:27| Now you're talking about bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| Bonds or any other form of borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| I would like to discourage that in borrowing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| I'd like to see a balanced budget, of course, like everybody else wants to see a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=6997)|
| 1:56:46| But we have programs that possibly we might have to take a second look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7006)|
| 1:56:54| I don't have any particular programs off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| but in order to save money or save these tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| roll them over to another more essential program might be the most important thing we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| I understand this is going to be a very stringent budget year, and I'd like to help in the process of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7032)|
| 1:57:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| Commissioner Lappert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| Mike, let me ask you, and first of all, I do want to say that I have seen you do volunteer work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| I appreciate the volunteer work you do with community television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| You do a great job with that stuff, helping people put on their television shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| And that shows your volunteer spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I wanted to ask you about TIFs, tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Are you familiar with the concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| And are you more in favor of TIFs for, you know, to urge redevelopment and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7068)|
| 1:57:58| Or, you know, how do you feel about that tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| Well, you know, over the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| we've always had a history that TIFs are incentives to bring businesses into blighted communities, I guess you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7085)|
| 1:58:15| But I feel that TIFs are a great way to improve the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| and help new business develop and implement, help business develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7100)|
| 1:58:29| But it needs to be implemented properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| We need to look at these TIFs on an individual basis and how they're processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| I will look at it very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| And it is the best thing for the county's growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you, Mr. Alford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7131)|

| 2:01:19| Now, granted, we only have seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| If I get the appointment, what can I hope to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| Whatever the people of the 4th District want me to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| There's a lot going on, but really, I think just as much I'll be doing as much listening as I'll be doing as much speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7287)|
| 2:01:34| I think it's important for me to listen to people of the 4th and give them some representation that they have not had in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7294)|
| 2:01:42| I think that's disappointing in all this, is that there's people out there who haven't had representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| and some people are kind of glad that they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| When you go door-to-door, unfortunately, some people have actually said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| It's a shame, because as somebody who's just so passionate about this area that we live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| and what you guys can accomplish up there, it's a shame to me that there are actually people out there who just frown at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| But like I said, my involvement in the local community, being as young as I am, I'm now getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7330)|

| 2:02:36| due to the sheer fact of my involvement and my help with our Young Professional Leadership Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7356)|

| 2:03:16| I really want this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| I think that even though I'm the youngest, and Mr. Lambert, I know you're looking at vote totals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| and you may see that I only got 633 votes, and I know that there have been others that have said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| and some may question that, well, we want somebody who's had more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| Well, I ran a very effective race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| I'm not questioning it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| I was just going to say that's not an issue in this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| You'll get your chance, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| All I'm saying is just take into consideration the amount of time and effort I put in this race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| I basically campaigned for 40 days, received 633 votes, raised $2,000, and only spent $1,800 of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| I paid about two and a quarter a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| I got 11% of the vote in 40 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| I think it says a lot that when I went door to door, because I had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| because I did not have the money to go out and buy ads or buy a lot of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| my job was to be grassroots, go door to door, call people, knock on their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7445)|
| 2:04:11| And for being a younger person, a fresh face, people really wanted me in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| And I'm passionately, like I said, passionately excited about this appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7458)|

| 2:04:52| There are so many good candidates in this fourth district race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| There's a lot of people to choose from, but you deliver your message well and your enthusiasm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| and you're very passionate about what you do, and I applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7501)|
| 2:05:06| And no matter what happens the next couple of weeks, whatever, you keep doing what Logan's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7506)|
| 2:05:10| And, Logan, you're going someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7510)|

| 2:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| I'm not going anywhere, and just like I said, this is the first of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| Let me ask you real quick, anything in particular that you would like to see done in the fourth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7519)|
| 2:05:29| Really just give them a positive voice of representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| I think when I went door to door, the majority of things that you heard was a tremendous amount of apathy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| that people didn't have any representation, didn't have a say in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| I think that's a little bit of a disappointment on their end, and I just want to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| if somebody has an issue, they actually have somebody that they can talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| and I can actually stand up there and give my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| Whether it's to get things done in seven months, it's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| We all know that we've got a tremendous budget coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| I think right now, pre-education debt, we're at $652 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| We're around $600 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| After the fact, we've got a $357 million education school board budget that we have to look into as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| So there's only so much that we may be able to do financially, as in improving Nubbins Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| or taking care of some other park areas around the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| But right now, my main objective is to be a positive voice for the fourth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| and be a good caretaker and make the transfer for whoever the winner is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| whether it's Steve Drevick or Ed Schaus, make that as smooth as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| How do you feel about your land use issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| I mean, you're looking at the map up there in Knox County on the wall and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| and somebody's wanting to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| The neighborhoods are up in arms about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| I mean, what would make your decisions for you on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| I think a lot of community involvement needs to be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| And just as Mr. McKenzie has stated, on a case-by-case basis, I think that's tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| because there's a big difference between land development residential or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| I know with you guys just going through the TIF issue with Mr. Graham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| and developing a large amount of area out in the halls locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| I think what we have to take into consideration is overdevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| because we can't develop faster than what we grow as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| What I'm trying to, I guess, get across is that we really have to focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| is there a tremendous need for development right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| But if there is and it's in a proper location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| and the developer is willing to take on a burden of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| I would be more than happy to listen to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| But I think that the community needs to be involved in it as well as the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| if it's a large manufacturing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| Yeah, I just wanted to explain to you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| and you're doing extremely well with me right now, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| if the top vote getter in a district is willing to accept the nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7665)|
| 2:07:50| I give them a couple of check marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| Based on what you said, check marks or X marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| And you're doing extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| And so that is not an issue since the top vote getter in either of the fourth district races is willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7679)|
| 2:08:08| Can I ask you, what's your party affiliation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7688)|

| 2:08:26| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| I just now turned it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| I'm going to ask you the same question I've asked everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Do you promise to not take your oath of office until we are completely done with the process of the appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7716)|
| 2:08:43| If you were so appointed and take your oath with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| I think as Chuck had said it earlier, I'd be more than happy to stand there right in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| and wait until it's all said and done with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| And I'd be proud to have my family there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| I appreciate that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| And how do you feel about TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| Just as I think we kind of explained, Mr. Smith, I think it needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| I don't think we need to overdevelop if we're not growing as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| If it's needed and it's necessary, I would be more than willing to approve of TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| If it works well within the structure of the development in the area and that area is ready for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| I would be more than happy to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| I know we've used the TIFs effectively in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| I know we've used them effectively downtown and in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| I'm not going to turn it down just because it's a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| I think it's a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| If it's for the betterment of Knox County, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| Thank you, Mr. Brummett, for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| And, indeed, you represent yourself very well at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| You mentioned some things in the Fourth District, your time that you've campaigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7789)|
| 2:09:58| A couple of the outstanding issues that if you were appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| you would definitely try to promote those within this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| Well, education, number one, I think there's not necessarily it's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| I think it's just outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| But I think looking into the juvenile court systems, I had a meeting with Tim Irwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| who is a member of my district, although he helps magistrate over at the juvenile court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| And I know that's an issue with him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| After speaking with him, something that affects him on a day-to-day basis is the fact that he's got kids at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| Fulton High School in Austin East that are showing up on a day-to-day basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| And that it's getting to the point where they're working as hard as they possibly can every day, a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| and they're not sure if they have the manpower for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| And do we need to look in at possibly getting him another employee over there to help out his cause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| And I know that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| As a younger generation person, I want to make sure our kids are doing everything they can to independently be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7847)|
| 2:10:55| Now, to do that, you've got to go to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| And apparently right now, after speaking with him, there's some schools out there where kids aren't going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| And that's a shame to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| And, you know, we've just got to do the best we can to get the parents involved as well as the business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| and get them involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| I know that is one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| And on an education standpoint, I'd have to look and sit down with the budget before you could even consider anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| I think one big concern is making sure we're keeping our teachers in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| that we're not losing them to another school or losing them out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7883)|
| 2:11:28| You had an opportunity to throw me a bone on that teacher thing, and you didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| As my former biology teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| We won't hold that against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| Do you have another question, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Pretty much what Tony had, same general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| Thank you, Mr. Bromley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| William Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7913)|
| 2:12:01| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| My name is William Daniels, 1505 Botsford Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7922)|
| 2:12:11| I want to thank you all for giving the candidates an opportunity to speak to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| Thirteen months ago, I turned in basically the same information that you gentlemen have in front of you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7937)|
| 2:12:26| I didn't know any of you at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| I didn't know who you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| I didn't know what your faces looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| But I believe over these last 13 months, most of you have had an opportunity to at least speak to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| You've had an opportunity to get to know me as a gentleman and as someone who is, I believe, extremely well educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7958)|
| 2:12:48| I have an MBA degree, graduated summa cum laude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| I have two undergraduate business degrees, one in accounting and one in marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7972)|
| 2:12:58| But I believe my greatest education has come from working for some of the top flight companies I've been able to be blessed and employed by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7978)|
| 2:13:06| Those companies include Westinghouse, TVA, and Entergy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| I've also been blessed to be able to run divisions where I've had as many as 250 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7991)|
| 2:13:18| I've also had to manage hundreds of millions of dollars of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| And in some of those budgets, I've had to cut as much as $50 million or 10% of a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8002)|
| 2:13:28| It isn't pleasant. It's painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| But it's something we may be looking at in Knox County Commission here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| While I was with TVA, one of the things that I got to do that a lot of people will never get to see is the behind the scenes of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8015)|
| 2:13:44| Economic development had to go through my office in Mississippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| And I had the opportunity to sit across the table and look square in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| CEOs, COOs, and CFOs are some of the top companies in this country and in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| And I was also able to see what they held most important when they look at a community, deciding on where they want to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8044)|
| 2:14:12| Because, see, they would come to TVA before they'd come to the county, before they would come to the city, and before they'd come to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| Because economic development has to first find out, the companies have to find out, if you have the ability to serve them electricity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| It doesn't matter if it's a high-rise office complex. It doesn't matter if it's a factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| They have to know if you can serve that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| They want to know what kind of economic development credits, energy credits, you're going to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| So what their electricity is going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| They also want to know what kind of free money, low-interest money, TVA had to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| And that went into their calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| But when I sit down to meet with them, the first thing they did was open a four-inch file folder, every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| And they begin to slide across newspaper articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| And they dealt with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| They dealt with the way the government was being run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| Because they had to know if they could come in and fairly compete with the companies that were already in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8104)|
| 2:15:12| I ran for commission a few weeks ago, and I finished second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| I had half the amount of money that my competition had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| I had no staff except my wife and my seven- and nine-year-old daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| We knocked on over 2,200 doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| And we made over 1,000 phone calls to the voters in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| I was constantly asked, William, why are you running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| You're a businessman. Why are you running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| But I was always taught by my parents that we're to serve others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| We're to take our talents and our abilities and use it to serve others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| I was taught that public service is about being a servant, not being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| I was taught that it's about being selfless, not selfish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| If you've had a chance to review the organizations that I've been a part of, you'll see that that's a part of my life's philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| It's also something we've taught our daughters, to serve others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8168)|
| 2:16:13| A lot of the things I do don't show up in the newspaper, like passing out Bibles for the Gideons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8173)|
| 2:16:19| working with underprivileged folks through CARM and other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8179)|
| 2:16:25| It's just something I was taught that you do for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| The 6th and 7th day of February, my phone did not stop ringing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8191)|
| 2:16:39| I honestly had people calling, thanking me for running and congratulating me on running a good race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| I picked up the Republican side, which I'm a Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| I picked up the second highest vote total on the Republican side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| The folks asked me what I consider taking this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| They reminded me of my business experience, of the experience I had told them about when I knocked on their doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| the experience of working in big business and having to deal with large budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| They also reminded me of the fact that I used to be an accountant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| and I've done audits on companies the size of Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| In a meeting the other night, several of you all mentioned that you weren't accountants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| and you didn't understand audits and some of the budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| Those are things I do understand, because I've been there and I've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8246)|
| 2:17:33| I'm not a politician. I'm a businessman, and I believe I'm a statesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8253)|
| 2:17:39| I believe proposals should stand on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| I'm not going to vote for anything to get your reciprocal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8262)|
| 2:17:47| I believe Knox County needs a proactive plan to where we get things in place before we have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8267)|
| 2:17:57| And I believe Knox County has got to be a better steward of the money that we're entrusted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| I believe if it's broke, you fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| If it can't be fixed, you get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| And you don't continue to throw money at things that don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| Who wants to start the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| I'll start it, as I always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| Will you promise to not take the appointment, if you get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| or take the oath until the process is done and we swear everybody in at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8309)|
| 2:18:35| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| I will not take an oath until everyone takes their oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| How do you feel about land use issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| You know, Craig, I think the most important thing on land use issues is to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| And I know you all have heard this from a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| By the time you get down to me, obviously you've had several people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| But you've got to look at it on an individualized basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| For example, if a Bass Pro Shop wanted to locate in Knox County, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| where would be a proper place to put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| Where would it create the least amount of traffic impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| Do you have the infrastructure in place already to be able to handle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| But I believe most importantly you've got to look at what impact does that use of that land have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8356)|
| 2:19:23| on the community, on the county, and on the resources of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| And how do you feel about TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| Where do you think it's appropriate and where do you think it's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| You know, I think the main thing is what is the return on investment for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| If you can use a TIF that's going to bring great jobs into this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| that helps the people in blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| It helps all the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| I believe first and foremost they should be in blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| But if we have an opportunity to help bring a company in that will bring jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| and help create better schools for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| then I think that's another good use for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| And when do you think it's not appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| I think when you've got a developed area that really doesn't need the assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8412)|
| 2:20:20| Again, I think you have to look at it on an individualized basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| But, you know, I don't see it being a good thing whenever it's used just to help someone make their numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8424)|
| 2:20:33| You know, if the project stands on its own, then obviously it's a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| If the community has to assist with that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| and it's a normal type of ongoing enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| then I don't know that that's necessarily a good use of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8445)|
| 2:20:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| William, you're in one of our more crowded fields I see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| You've got five candidates that are applying for the fourth district there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| and we'll take two there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| Sort of like what some other commissioners have asked here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| what separates you, you know, I know you're not going to name call or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| but, I mean, tell us, why should we pick you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| I mean, tell us what will you really bring to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| that will separate you versus the other candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| What's your strong points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| Larry, I think my greatest asset is the fact that I do have experience in large business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8482)|
| 2:21:29| And, obviously, Knox County, we have a $640 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| That's something I've seen on a routine basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| I've had the experience as an accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| I have the experience of managing large forces of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| Obviously, this job doesn't require you managing people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8504)|
| 2:21:48| but you do have the responsibility of taking and taking a business look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| at how these departments are operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| You know, we have a budget coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| I've had experience in developing half-billion-dollar budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| and I think that it's something that we're going to have to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| I don't think our public, our gas prices are through the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| home heating is through the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| You know, I don't think our citizens are willing to see a double-digit tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8531)|
| 2:22:19| When we have an opportunity to pare down maybe some of the things that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| and, again, as I said earlier, if it's broke, fix it, and if it's not broke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8544)|
| 2:22:28| then, you know, if it doesn't work, let's be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Let's make our government efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| Let's get rid of the red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| Those are things that I do extremely well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| and it's one of the reasons these companies hired me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8560)|
| 2:22:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Thank you, Mr. Daniels, for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| You've witnessed the last few meetings of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| Do you have any comments about the functioning of the commission in our meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8575)|
| 2:23:02| Specifically, I'd probably refer to the level of discourse or civil discourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8582)|
| 2:23:11| You've been in large corporations, large boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| How do we compare in that respect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| What I would say is that, you know, respect isn't about me necessarily liking you or you liking me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8601)|
| 2:23:28| It's something you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| It's something you make a choice on whether or not you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| If I'm asked to serve as one of the commissioners, then I'm going to respect you whether I like you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8613)|
| 2:23:41| Whether I like your stand or not, I'm going to respect your opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8621)|
| 2:23:46| Again, it doesn't mean that, you know, when I get up and we walk out of here, you know, we're going to shake hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| and everything's going to be fine, but, you know, I was always taught that you respect everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8631)|
| 2:23:58| It doesn't matter if you agree with them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| And I think as long as this board of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| as long as this group makes the promise to each other that we'll respect each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| then I think we'll give the Knox Countians, our people, a government they'll all be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8650)|
| 2:24:20| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| William, you have some great educational background and management skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8665)|
| 2:24:34| I'm a little bit confused as to what you do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| I have a construction company by the name of Covenant Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| We also have a vending company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| And my wife and I are both real estate agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| But as far as Covenant, that's not connected to the hospitals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| Tell us about land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| What are you feeling for land use issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| Who did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| Craig did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| I thought you did the normal swearing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| I threw a curve on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8719)|
| 2:25:20| Thank you, Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8721)|

| 2:25:31| My name is Elaine Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| I live at 913 Station View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8732)|
| 2:25:36| And as it's 838, and I know that you all have continued to have long meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8736)|
| 2:25:41| and long meetings, I'll be very brief about my background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| and answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| I'm 40 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| I'm married, and I have three small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| I graduated from Farragut High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| and I'm a graduate from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| with a BA in psychology and criminal justice, graduated with honors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| I have business experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| Prior to having my children, I was the office manager for a law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8764)|
| 2:26:08| and so we were very involved in the accounts process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| I didn't do any of the tax returns for the law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| but every other sort of aspect of it I handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| And if anybody's aware of a law firm, you have to have a trust account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| and that is a very important account to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| because any monies that come in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| that attorney, if there's any discrepancies, that attorney can be disbarred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| So it's a very important process to make sure that you handle that very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8791)|
| 2:26:37| Also, just currently, what I'm involved in and activities in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8797)|
| 2:26:42| I'm currently serving in Knoxville Community Action Committee's leadership program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| and then also I'm serving with West Hills PTA, where my son goes to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| I'm on the legislative committee. I'm the legislative chair there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| In the past, I've been the chair of the building and grounds committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| I've been very active in the American Diabetes Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| and then also Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| and that is because I have a child with type 1 diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| And those advocacy efforts have led me to help have state legislation passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| and I don't know if anybody's ever been involved with the teachers' unions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| or the school nurses' unions or any of those bodies of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| They're extremely contentious, and it was a very difficult process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| but I brought all of those people to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| and we hammered out a resolution and had some legislation passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| and I'm very happy to say that because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| we have worked to get more nurses into our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| And this current budget year, they have added four more nurses into the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| and that only benefits the 53,000 students that attend our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| but it also benefits the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| In campaigning, I have campaigned since August of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| I ran in August of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| I was a riding candidate prior to that and put on the general ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| With that campaign in 2006 and then currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| I feel that I've really become in touch with a lot of the voters in the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8886)|
| 2:28:11| I think that people recognized that because I do have a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8891)|
| 2:28:18| because I do have children in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| they identified with me, and I could identify with their struggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| and their concerns and their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| And I believe in learning and effectively becoming a leader for the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| that I can work with this body and let you know their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| and you can let me know your needs of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| No, I don't have any conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| The only thing is that if you appoint William,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| me and him can't sit next to each other in Sunday school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| So that's about the only conflict that I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| And I'll be glad to answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| I'm going to ask you like I've asked everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| Will you promise to not take the oath of office if you're appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| until we're done with our appointment process and we swear everybody in at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| You said you're a graduate of Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| So am I. What year did you graduate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| Well, then you graduated with my little sister because I graduated in 81.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| Oh, you probably graduated with my sister, Becca Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| I know your Uncle Bobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8966)|
| 2:29:31| You know, I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| Anyway, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| I was going to talk to Logan about some stuff later, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| because my family used to live in Kingsgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| Logan was a little bit young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8978)|
| 2:29:39| I didn't want to ask him what year he graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| Right, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| He's about 15 years younger than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| But his family lives in Kingsgate, and that's where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| So I just wondered if we lived down the street from each other and never knew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| I tried to babysit him one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| How do you feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8992)|
| 2:29:56| I'm sure you made a great babysitter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=8996)|
| 2:30:00| How do you feel about land use issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9000)|
| 2:30:02| and what kind of factors would you take a look at in making those decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| I think land use issues are incredibly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| and probably, next to puppies and kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| probably some of the most contentious things that you can probably argue about on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| But I think the important thing is, just as everyone has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| you need to look at it by case by case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| But one of the things you need to look at is what is that impact going to be on the schools in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| on your emergent services, on your infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| what does it bring into that community and into that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| I know that in the 4th District, a lot of the development that has been occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9035)|
| 2:30:41| is established neighborhoods, turning into condos, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| I know in Gleason, there's been quite a few condos go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| And so one of those things that you really want to make sure is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| even though the infrastructure is there and in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| is it capable to handle the number of units per acre or the units that come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9055)|
| 2:31:02| and what sort of traffic patterns you're going to create with those additional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9062)|
| 2:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| Everybody else has been asked about TIFs, so let me ask about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| And then if you don't mind, also, what you learned when you were out block walking your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| I thought you were going to ask me what separated me from everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| I let Larry borrow that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| Okay. All right, so first was TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9088)|
| 2:31:31| I think TIFs are a useful tool, and if you use the but-for standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| then I think it's appropriate and can be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| And it's important to make sure that if you're trying to develop your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| that you use all the necessary tools available to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| but you don't want to overuse it and you don't want to be wasteful with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9107)|
| 2:31:50| to where it becomes something that the public says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9110)|
| 2:31:52| oh, well, that's a rubber stamp for their friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| You need to make sure that it qualifies and quantifies that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| Okay, what was the second part of your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9119)|
| 2:32:00| Learned while block walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| Learned while block walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| A lot of people don't know who their commissioners are, have no idea what commission does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| don't understand the importance of voting locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| that these local decisions impact their daily life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| And that was one of the most important things, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| was just helping to make people become more aware that they need to be involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| who determines and affects their daily life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| I think a lot of people are so busy just trying to pay for a gallon of gas and a gallon of milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| that they rely upon local officials to make all these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| and be educated decision makers for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| And so that's where it's so important that the people that we elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| and the people that we appoint are qualified candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| not just 18 and live in the district, but actually have a little bit of substance behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9170)|
| 2:32:57| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| Elaine, I've got your stuff here from last time, and you ran a strong showing last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| We were looking at the appointments, and I've watched your campaign, and you've done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9185)|
| 2:33:09| Just like I asked William, I want to ask you the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| What makes you different from the other five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| What do you bring to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| Well, I'm not as funny as Walt, so that's my weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| But I am a woman, obviously, and as a woman, we do see things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| We have a different role in society, and we have a different perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| I know that a USA Today article back in December had a thing that city planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| had forgotten to really take a look at females and safety issues in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| They had to recognize that women, when we're walking around at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| we're feeling in a different perspective of our safety, personal safety, than men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| And so there's different aspects that maybe I could bring to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| different questions that I might ask, just because of the mere fact that I see things from a different vantage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| And then also, I think what really sets me apart from everyone else is I did run in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9240)|
| 2:34:09| and the votes that I received in 2006 were strong numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| but included in those votes were people that voted against term limited commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| This time around, when people voted, they voted for Elaine Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| They didn't vote against someone else, or they didn't vote against an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| They voted for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| It was a vote of confidence for me, and I had 1,761 people vote for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| Oh, by the way, I want to say thank you for approving the money for the fire at Tedford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| That's another thing, is that we really need to make sure that we have someone in the 4th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| that can represent them and can have constituent servicing out there in the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| But I do appreciate you all approving the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| Is that fire, is it out yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9308)|

| 2:35:21| Commissioners, thank you for seeing me this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| and thank you for remaining awake as we save the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| I'd like to thank Elaine for the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| If you decide not to appoint me to commission, I'm looking for the class clown award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| And Logan, thank you very much for pointing out how many decades older the rest of us are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| Commissioners, I came to Knoxville 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| The company I work for, Holiday Inn Corporate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| brought me here to renovate the Holiday Inn at Paper Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| And they made a promise to me 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| that if I came to Knoxville and fixed that hotel, I could leave in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| And it sounded like a plan at that time until I got here with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| My wife Susan, my children Caitlin and Adam came to Knoxville in 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9369)|
| 2:36:15| and we fell in love with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| We decided that this was the place that we wanted to raise our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| and we were going to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| In an effort to stay here, when that hotel got renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| and they wanted me to move on to either Cocoa Beach, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| or Olive Branch, Mississippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| I decided to change companies so that I could stay here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9393)|
| 2:36:37| As I said, I live in the Rocky Hill section of town with my wife Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| coming up on 24 years of marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9401)|

| 2:37:11| I have a track record of giving the people, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| what they want and being responsive to their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| I have a tremendous amount of experience with creating budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| working within budgets, and modifying budgets as revenues don't materialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9442)|

| 2:37:47| Some of you may have gotten to know me about five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| when I was co-chairman of an organization called the Downtown Hotel Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| We took offense to the city of Knoxville trying to use $80 million in taxpayers' money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9475)|
| 2:38:01| to build a hotel in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| We initiated a petition drive, got a referendum on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| and it is now illegal for the city of Knoxville to build a new hotel downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| without going back to the voters and asking for permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9493)|
| 2:38:16| I believe, as I said through my campaign, I've said many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| I believe that there's four things that someone needs to be a good public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| You need a strong moral compass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| You need some common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| You need to pay attention to what's going on, and you need to give a damn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| I have those characteristics, and I appreciate your support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| and I'm prepared to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| Commissioner Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9521)|
| 2:38:42| I was wondering who he's pulling for tonight in basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9522)|
| 2:38:46| Can you give us a score?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| I haven't got the score, but he went to Rutgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| I'll check this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| He didn't answer right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| Commissioner, I did go to Rutgers, Scarlet Knights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| and when I moved to town we got a dog from the pound, and it's a blue tick hound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| And someone said to me, one of my neighbors said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| oh, that's a blue tick hound like Smokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| And ten years ago I said, well, who's Smokey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| So we had to name that dog, and to sort of maintain our Rutgers affiliation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| that dog's name is Scarlet in honor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| Sounds like a good southern name, but she's named after the Scarlet Knights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9561)|
| 2:39:25| He still hadn't answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| Sounds like a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| Go ahead, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9572)|
| 2:39:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| I'm going to ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| Do you promise to not take an oath of office and get sworn in if you were appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| until we were through with the process of appointing everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| and you could get sworn in with everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| I make it a point to not go out of my way to go before a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| So, yes, I'd be more than happy to wait until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| And for Larry Smith, your land use issues, how are you going to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| What factors do you think are important in making those decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| Because, you know, the 4th District still has a lot of issues that are going to come before us as far as zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| So how are you going to take a look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| Well, I know no one's said it so far this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| but I think it needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| But one of the things that really hasn't been mentioned is that those items of land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| and development don't come before this body unless there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-080211-forum?start=9626)|
