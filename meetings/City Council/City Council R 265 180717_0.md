| 0:02:04| Okay, so is there a motion to approve the minutes of July 3rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| 9B is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| The developer got in touch with me and does not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Okay, so it's a motion to withdraw. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| That is 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| That item is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Any other items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| I was waiting for it to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Yeah, the noise ordinance 9A, as implications of free speech existed in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| and it became obvious that the ordinance didn't adequately address the availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| or affordability of permitting to allow amplified sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| I'm going to make a motion to delay that for four weeks, Mayor, if that's possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| so that we can rewrite the ordinance and make clarifications as to amplified sound for KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| while also allowing for reasonable and affordable options to obtain permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| and take care of it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| Thank you. So we ask that this be delayed last time, and we need another four weeks on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| And I want to ask Bill Lyons, our Deputy to the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| to talk about, because we're going in a different direction from amplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Yes. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| We are now taking a fresh look at that based on what we heard at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| and also our own further study of this, along with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| that probably a more fruitful avenue to pursue is that of what the actual decibel level of the sound is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| regardless of whether it's amplified or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| That distinction anymore was an artificial one, and, as you say, brought up some unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| We've discussed this with the people who had spoken, and they seem quite pleased that we're taking this approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=252)|
| 0:04:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Councilwoman Ryder. Oh, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| And now we had one person sign up to speak to this. Mr. Corcoran, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=264)|
| 0:04:33| Okay. Yes, he would check. So it will look different than what it did this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| So that will be online, or you can contact Dr. Lyons when it's ready, and then you can see how it's been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| All right. So we have a motion to postpone for four weeks 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| And we have a motion. Did I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| So all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| And that motion or that ordinance is postponed four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=303)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| You perform a very important service up here, keeping me on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| I had moved ahead to 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Okay. So anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| All right. Consent items of 5D is 11K certificate of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Any opposed? The ayes have it. And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| I would have skipped my mayor's report and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Okay. So for the mayor's report, first I want to remind everyone that early voting has started for the August 2nd election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=356)|
| 0:06:06| Now, this is not a city election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| It is a Knox County general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| County mayor, some county commissioners, some other county seats are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| And it's the primary election for state and federal offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| So we have a state senator and all of our state representatives, our congressional seat that Congressman Duncan is now in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=380)|
| 0:06:30| That's primary and some more like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| So it's not a city election, but county general and primary election for state and federal offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| That has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| And early voting will continue through next Saturday, July 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| You can find information about voting sites and hours online at knoxcounty.org slash election, including absentee ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=405)|
| 0:06:55| There have been about 6,700 votes cast through yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| That's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| But there are a whole lot more of potential voters out there who haven't voted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| I encourage all registered voters to make sure to cast your ballot in these very important local, state and federal elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| And as we have seen many times locally and nationally, every vote really does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| You are all invited to join me at 1030 a.m. tomorrow, July 18th, at our Public Works Service Center at 3131 Morris Avenue for an exciting announcement about a new weatherization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=439)|
| 0:07:32| We'll be introducing Home Uplift, which is a new partnership between KUB, TVA, the city and CAC that will build on the success that we've had with the Round It Up and Extreme Energy Makeover programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=452)|
| 0:07:47| This program will double the number of homes that CAC can weatherize for families who qualify based on income over the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=467)|
| 0:07:57| And it will improve energy efficiency and reduce utility bills for residents on limited incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| This has all grown out of our Smarter Cities Partnership, overseen by our Office of Sustainability, and it will be another great benefit to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| Again, that event is tomorrow at 1030 a.m. at the Public Works Service Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| And if you can't be there but want information about that program and potential weatherization of your home, you can call CAC and they can give you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=497)|
| 0:08:28| We have another exciting event this Friday, July 20th, at 130 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| The Emerald Youth Foundation and community leaders will break ground on the new Lonsdale Recreational and Educational Complex that they are building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=513)|
| 0:08:42| The event will be held on the property at the corner of Texas Avenue and Stonewall Street in the Lonsdale community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| As you'll recall, that particular city block was property that the city originally assembled from blighted lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| This complex will be a great asset to the Lonsdale community and to kids across our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Our Community Development Director, Becky Way, and our COO, David Brace, have all put in a lot of work with the community and with Emerald Youth to get us to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=542)|
| 0:09:15| So we'll be happy to celebrate that groundbreaking this Friday at 130 at the corner of Texas Avenue and Stonewall Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=555)|
| 0:09:24| Also, construction gets underway next month on the $4.18 million first phase of the Magnolia Avenue streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=564)|
| 0:09:34| If you'd like to get more details about this project, an open house is scheduled on Monday, July 23rd from 530 to 7 at the John T. O'Connor Senior Center on Winona Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=574)|
| 0:09:46| Our engineering and redevelopment staff will be there Monday to talk with you one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| Also at this open house, Vaughn and Melton, who's providing the construction engineering and inspection services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| they will be there to answer questions and also the general contractor, which is the Franklin Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| So look for these streetscapes enhancements on Magnolia Avenue between Jessamine and Myrtle to be finished by fall of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=604)|
| 0:10:15| The improvements include landscape center medians with designated left turn lanes, wider sidewalks and bike lanes, street trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| designated on-street parking, traffic signal upgrades, LED pedestrian and street lighting, and new stamped crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=623)|
| 0:10:31| Finally, I want to make sure that Council and folks are aware of a retirement reception plan for our recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| it says recently departed Police Chief David Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| I didn't notice that when I first read it, but he's departed from the city, but he is alive and well in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=643)|
| 0:10:53| As you all know, Chief Roush was appointed by Governor Haslam last month as the director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| He had to leave in a hurry because the governor needed him to start right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| So we didn't have time for a formal retirement celebration, but that will happen at 2 p.m. on Friday, July 27th at the Holiday Inn World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=664)|
| 0:11:14| That is part of the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police are meeting in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| and we will have that reception for our local folks as well as for all the chiefs who are coming in from around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=679)|
| 0:11:28| So 2 p.m. Friday, July 27th at the Holiday Inn World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Also, coming up soon, we'll have a formal promotion ceremony for our new Police Chief Eve Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| Are there any reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I wanted to invite everybody to Book Sandwiched In on Wednesday, July 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| It's a monthly program that they do a book review, but this July, or July 25th, I'm going to be reviewing Color of Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| It's a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| It's Color of Law, A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| It's a depressing book about sort of the history of how government at all different levels systematically imposed residential segregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=728)|
| 0:12:18| But I selected this book because as we are updating the zoning code through the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=738)|
| 0:12:27| I thought it was important for the community to have a discussion about how different things local governments have done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=747)|
| 0:12:35| And I think we're all committed to increasing diversity and affordability through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| So I thought it was good to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Again, it's July 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| It's at the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| It's at 12 noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| And as it says online, drinks are 50 cents and reading the book is optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| So come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| I'm going to try to leave a good hunk for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| I've talked to some local people in the community that I hope will add to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| So I just wanted to invite everybody to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=785)|

| 0:14:53| and our students really can't do their best without the school supplies they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| That's why I'm very excited to partner with Councilmembers Ryder and Campin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| along with the North Knox Business and Professional Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=903)|

| 0:15:56| And again, I'd welcome everyone to join Councilmembers Ryder, Campin, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=956)|

| 0:18:28| And Jim York is here to answer any questions. Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| Jim, do you mind answering a couple questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1113)|
| 0:18:45| Jim York, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Thank you. I know we spent a lot of time talking about this. I was trying to understand what it was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| This is not us borrowing money. It's using the money that we have so that we don't have to borrow money until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1132)|
| 0:19:04| That's correct. What this does is when you borrow bonds, unless you pass a resolution of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1144)|
| 0:19:12| you cannot spend any of those bond proceeds on anything that occurred before the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| So what we try and do is pass this resolution of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| which gives us the ability to go ahead and self-fund up until the time we do choose to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| You are not committed to borrowing. It just gives you the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| And what that means is that any expenses incurred on a variety of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| we can repay ourselves basically from those bond proceeds once we do decide the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| For those people who have probably done some sort of construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| it's kind of like an internal letter of credit or internal line of credit where we fund everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| and then we'll repay ourselves at the point we do choose to borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| So, of course, any of the decisions that we make on spending that money will still go in front of counsel before it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| All right. Thank you. Any other questions for Jim right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Okay. We'll hear from the two individuals signed up to speak. The first is Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Mr. Hayes, come on down. And the next is Barbara Bridges will be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1226)|
| 0:20:36| Mr. Hayes, please state your name and address for the record and appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| My name is David Hayes. I live at 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| So, yes, I just want to come out tonight just to once again voice opposition to the city of Knoxville spending $40 million for a policing headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1248)|
| 0:21:01| spending $40 million for a headquarters in which this is a subject in which it has not been adequately talked about in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1261)|
| 0:21:12| People are still unaware of the fact that the city is trying to spend $40 million on a police station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| This is a time where we're seeing we're in an affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| I would argue that black folks have always been in an affordable housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| especially because of the city's efforts, especially when we look at urban renewal, Negro removal, as we like to call it, as lots of folks like to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1287)|
| 0:21:36| gentrification and other effects that y'all's development has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| When we think about $40 million being spent by the city for policing and not affordable housing and not recreational activities for youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1301)|
| 0:21:51| and not for economic development programs and communities of color and working class communities and not for educational programs and not to grants for community organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1311)|
| 0:22:02| and not to fixing roads and sidewalks and black communities and working class communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| when we think about $40 million going to policing and not things that actually affect us, not things that we actually need to uplift ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| and not to actually addressing the root cause of why the police are called so many times, it's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| I just wanted to come up here and voice opposition to that and voice opposition to anything that moves the process along to acquire the $40 million to build this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1340)|
| 0:22:30| I would hope that y'all would halt on this and anything having to do with this police station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| You would do a good job of asking folks in the community to do an engagement, inviting folks out, actually spreading the word so people actually have an idea of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| Because spending $40 million on more police, while we have so many other social services and public health and public welfare gaps and needs in our communities, I think is not ethical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1363)|
| 0:22:56| So take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1378)|

| 0:23:09| Barbara Bridges here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1389)|
| 0:23:17| Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Barbara Bridges, 4536 Everwood Oak Lane, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| I'm also opposed to this resolution for the same reasons that David outlined as well as some others that I'll explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1408)|
| 0:23:41| First of all, the issuance of $40 million worth of bonds, those bonds will have to be repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| So this is a debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| So $40 million worth of debt that will have to be repaid over time with interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| And that debt burden will unduly burden all of the people that are going to be sitting in your seats in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1436)|
| 0:24:05| You all are not going to be occupying these positions forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| And the people that will be playing your role in the future, their decisions will be constrained by the fact that they are having to service the debt that was incurred in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1448)|
| 0:24:22| From what I understand, and Jim York can correct me if I'm wrong, the city is already paying $5 million every year just to service the debt that's already been incurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1462)|
| 0:24:32| That's a huge burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| And you're proposing to take on even more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| It concerns me that this debt could potentially jeopardize the pensions of city workers in the future as well as their compensation and benefits in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1479)|
| 0:24:51| I mean, it's your responsibility above all else to do right by the workers that dedicate their lives in service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1491)|
| 0:25:01| And the more debt that the city takes on for capital improvement projects like this, the more at risk those pensions are going to be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1501)|
| 0:25:14| As it stands now, from what I understand, the police already get a quarter of the city's annual budget is dedicated to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1514)|
| 0:25:25| That's without the $40 million for a new police headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| And I honestly don't feel like the need for a new headquarters has been demonstrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| We've been told that the police quarters that exist now up on Hill Avenue behind the Coliseum was built before the internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1538)|
| 0:25:48| And they can't figure out how to fit the internet in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| I mean, that makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| They haven't, I mean, all of this deal is taking place behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| We don't know what other sites were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| We haven't, the public hasn't been privy to any of the information that goes into making a decision like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| The exploration of alternatives, the weighing of the alternatives, the weighing of the costs of the different alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| We are presented with one option and one option alone, which is to put that police headquarters on the Knoxville College campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1584)|
| 0:26:33| And I would like to know what other sites were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| We don't even know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| So that's another problem is the lack of transparency of the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| I mean, I don't even think the city council members were made aware of this deal until after some really important decisions had already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1607)|
| 0:26:58| So that alone is cause for concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| And the most important reason is that I feel like this relocating the police headquarters to Knoxville College is a legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1621)|
| 0:27:15| It's a legacy of racist policies that have appropriated land from African-American residents of this city and handed it over to private developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1635)|
| 0:27:28| I mean, the police headquarters that exist now up on Hill Avenue is on land that was seized through eminent domain under urban renewal from the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1648)|
| 0:27:40| It was stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| And now you're proposing to do the same thing at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| I mean, if you look at page 70 in your agenda packet, it says it's an urban renewal project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| And it's a legacy of racist policing, to be honest with you, and racist appropriation of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| And later on in the agenda, you're going to be voting on tax abatements to the tune of millions of dollars for a couple of pilot projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1681)|
| 0:28:12| I mean, at the same time you're taking on $40 million worth of debt, you're going to give away millions of dollars in tax abatements to private developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1692)|
| 0:28:22| So I urge you against this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1706)|
| 0:28:38| Yeah, so this may be a question for Mr. Brace or Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| I can't see who's actually sitting down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| They're both down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| What are the next steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| And then also, could you answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| This might be for Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Where did the number of the $40 million come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Where did that estimate come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1735)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| I'm going to digress a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| If you recall, in part of your budget, we had a very extensive capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| For funding on that capital budget, we had proposed the issuance of $54.9 million in new debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1756)|
| 0:29:26| That was for a variety of projects, including, obviously, the aforementioned public safety building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| but also for improvements to urban wilderness, improvements to the coliseum and auditorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1774)|
| 0:29:45| improvements for the, I think we're calling it the Henley Gateway Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| That's probably a working title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| And there's some various other improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Again, this resolution is not borrowing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| I want to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| This just gives us the ability to self-fund and to repay ourselves from future bond proceeds should we decide to issue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1802)|
| 0:30:14| But if we do not pass this, then clearly we can incur expenses and not be able to repay ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| Obviously, if we don't borrow, then it's a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| But this gives you maximum flexibility should you decide to borrow in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1827)|
| 0:30:36| Councilwoman Ryder, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| So the next step is to secure a team, a design team and an owner's rep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| that would then start the process of reviewing the KPD needs, the fire department needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1844)|
| 0:30:51| potential recreational needs for a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| And so some of that work has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| The estimate for a police and fire headquarters is based on preliminary programming with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1857)|
| 0:31:05| and with the estimates from our public works complex, recent facility construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| And so, again, it is an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| So owner's rep, someone to wake up every day thinking about the project in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| with the skills to manage a complicated project like this, design team, programming review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| and obviously a very in-depth community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| And so this is just the start of an ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| The need for KPD has been communicated for a number of budget years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| I think it's been very clear that this administration has said public works is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Again, aging facilities, inefficient operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| So that is done or close to being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| And we've communicated for a number of years about the need for both a larger KPD facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| KPD has operations spread throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Some of those are leased spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| KFD admin is in a leased space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| And so how do we consolidate those facilities, be more efficient in our operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| And that's what this project is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| But there will be a very in-depth design community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| And obviously the site selection is not a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| And so Knoxville College had come to us with an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| and we had communicated an interest in exploring that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| But should that not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| then there are other sites that we would obviously work with the community administration on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| and look at those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| So this is really the beginning of a team effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| and it will involve significant community dialogue and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| I just would like to say I know myself and some of my colleagues have looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| and toured in every nook and cranny of the current headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| which we keep saying KPD, but it's also headquarters for KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| And I am concerned of the tax dollars that we're spending on leased space spread across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| and the amount of staff time that goes into driving to different facilities to pick up storage items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| which may be from someone's evidence for someone's crime, murder case, rape case, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| All those things are stored for long lengths of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And what I saw when I toured that building were people who had a lot of their office supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| and needs stored in hallways because there isn't room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| I saw spalding concrete that was falling and collapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| I saw a building in very poor condition and I was kind of a little amazed that we pushed it to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| that where we're bursting at the seams and the building is over full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| and to the point where we've had to go and lease space in other places in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| off of Fifth Avenue, off of Hill Avenue, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| to be able to make it work and hold it together at the seams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| That building is not adequate. I think that leads to morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| I think that hinders us from increasing programs and doing more community-related programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| So I think I'm in favor of this and will be voting for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| but I realize there's a lot of discussion about where it's going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| but that building is falling apart very literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| I saw buckets catching water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| I saw areas where we've had flooding and we've had to spend money to remediate from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| We shouldn't be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| We should have a building that adequately allows the testing and the evidence collection to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| and for staff to work and for us to work on some other KPD recruitment, KFD recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| Those are all things that need to be addressed and we need an adequate building and office space to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Mr. Brace, I just want to reiterate some of your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| This in no way ties us to any specific site, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| This is for preliminary costs that we might incur as we explore different sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| as we begin to pay the design team, as we may look at multiple sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| This would help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| I mean, this is preliminary to in no way does it limit us to a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| and in no way does it really bind us to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| It gives us a way to spend this money and then repay ourselves back out of the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| So we replenish our cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| We can use our cash in short-term use and then should we decide to go forward with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| then we could pay ourselves back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| If we decide not to go forward with it, then we're out the money that we spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| And to answer your question, this does not tie us to a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| What Mayor Rojero announced previously was an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| Knoxville College had come to us with an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| and what we had communicated to Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| and the public was a desire to explore that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Knoxville College obviously has significant debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| and so what we've said to Knoxville College is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| if you can work through and renegotiate that debt and we can help with that if you'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| and there's an opportunity to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| then we would love to look at the site and make sure that site is the right site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| But we can't do that until the debt question is answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| And so this does not tie us to a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| This is really about saving on interest if we are going to spend money on these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| And again, owners rep, design team, public process, that will all happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| And I think this administration has a good history of quality public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| and will continue to do that with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| So when we're ready to hire, for instance, an architectural firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| that contract will come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| And it will be part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Should we decide to have to do some soil testing at one of a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| a potential site that we want to use, that money would come out of this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| And we may not choose that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| I mean, we don't know that, but those contracts would come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| and we have the right to vote them up or vote them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| I think it's a wise use of the money and a wise use of the assets we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| and I definitely will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Did you want to add, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| You're just waiting for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| I'm waiting for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I want to ask you to state something in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| but I'll call on Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Just to clarify a little bit more, it does not tie us to a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| nor does it tie us to $40 million expenditure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| It does not tie us to a single site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| We are just starting that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| With right now, the owner's rep is actually out to be advertised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| through our purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| which is really the first step to get the team on board to start the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| No, it doesn't mean that we have to spend $40 million either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Could be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Could be more, depending on what's finally designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Well, we're committing to $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| That's up to $40 million, so it wouldn't be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| But, I mean, for this stage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| This is up to 40, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| This just gives us the right to reimburse ourselves for up to $40 million in expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| You could spend $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| You could spend $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| You could spend $50 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| but if you spend $50 million prior to the issuance of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| then you obviously can only reimburse yourself up to $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| And I think that at the point that we've reached $40 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| we're pretty far into the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| and so we'll probably be going to market at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| But our philosophy is not to borrow a day before we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| because we want to avoid interest costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| And so because we have a full house here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| I'd like for you to explain how we decide between your annual revenues that come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| your fund balance, and borrowing, and how we balance that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| and the fact that we manage that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| We have the highest bond rating in the history of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| We've maintained that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| And so just talk about that, about our ability to borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| and why you would borrow as opposed to draining your fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| One of the things that you always consider, and this is a constant balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| There's no exact one correct answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| But what you want to do is just like there are some items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| if we wanted to spend $200 million, we don't have that kind of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| You'd have to go out and borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| When we borrow, we look at capital expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| We cannot borrow for ongoing operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| That is not what these are for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| These are for bricks and mortar type items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| So that's the first decision point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Is this for bricks and mortar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Should you fund that out of recurring revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| Should you fund that out of available fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Should you fund that with borrowing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| And again, we will assess all of those on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| In terms of rating agencies, we've discussed this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| but one of the things that they tend to favor debt over use of fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| because what that does is drawing down your fund balance somewhat limits your flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| to deal with any emergencies or anything that might come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| If you've drained down all your available cash, you don't have that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| So that's the primary consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| One consideration that we just had, and again, for a borrowing we just had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| which made very intuitive sense is we're going to capture cash over a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| It makes sense to pay for that asset over 10 years, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| instead of burning down 10, you know, again, in this case it was like $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| Which I'm talking about the LED streetlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| For LED streetlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| It makes sense to borrow that and then basically pay for that over the cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| that you're going to recover through future savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| Some of these projects will not be that simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| but again, we're going to assess the funding mechanism on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| What this resolution does is, again, it does not cut out your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| You do this to maintain maximum flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| So if we borrow in the future, we can repay ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| And failure to do that means that we could incur expenses and not repay ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2508)|
| 0:41:57| The other option is go ahead and borrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| but we'd start paying interest from the day we borrow and we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| Again, we're trying to manage our money in the most financially responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| Right. Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Okay. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| We need a roll call vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| So if you support this, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| If you don't, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Councilman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Vice Mayor Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Councilman Singh-Perez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2563)|

| 0:43:09| Just to be clear, and this is a question for Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| this is really just housekeeping, it looks like to me, around property ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| We failed to convey property back in the 70s and 80s when it was originally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| Now we need to convey these deeds over to them and remove the reverter portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2609)|

| 0:44:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2673)|

| 0:44:36| Yeah, I keep forgetting which is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| You've got two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Councilwoman Zink-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| I just wanted to talk about this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I think the public has a lot of questions about pilots and what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| and I know it's a feeling like the city is giving away money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| so I would like to have some more discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I believe Mr. Nash is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| If you want to talk about the pilot process itself, Dr. Lyons may want to answer those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| but if you want questions of the developer, Mr. Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| I guess a general overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you, Councilwoman Zink-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| Yes, the pilot program is one where we have projects that go through a careful review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| including from a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| when developers proposed a development that would otherwise not be able to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| because of difficulties with the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| and challenges with the project site or the project structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| And what happens with the pilot is the taxes are frozen at their current level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| and then at the expiration of the pilot they are paid at the higher level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| so the city and the county would then recover all the property taxes later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| We do have an extensive process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| We answer two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| One, we have to assure that the project, in fact, would not happen but for the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| So the case being that if there were not a pilot, everything stayed as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| The taxes would be at X level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| With the pilot they would be at that same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| The city is not out anything and also the city is not at risk for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| The second is that the project generally be in the public interest to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| whether it be restoration of a historic building like the Cal Johnson building coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| a difficult structure and a difficult site that sat vacant and blighted for a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| jobs that could be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| There are a number of things that could go into the determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| of whether the public interest element of it is satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| And what advantage does that have for the city in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| Well, the advantage to the city is, one, the restoration of a historic building would be an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| General economic development, jobs, elimination of blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| taking something which could be a negative on the tax rolls that cost the fire and police danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| public safety danger, later codes danger, removing that and putting life into a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| all of those are advantages for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Long-term, and we really feel we must be stewards of the long-term city interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| increasing the tax base long-term enables the city to be economically viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| and have the opportunity to pay for all the programs that we really very much need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| that are beyond pure economics, the social service programs, parks and rec and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| So the short-term is to restore buildings, structures, eliminate blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| The long-term, to invigorate the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| and all of it is about economic development and jobs and opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2857)|
| 0:47:46| So if we were not to do the payment in lieu of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| how do you see the building, the development of that building going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| If we did not approve the payment in lieu of taxes, we'd have the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| We would have a deteriorating building with no use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| It's been in both of these things for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| That would go on as far as the eye could see until unless the building further deteriorated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| and then we might have a question of whether we had to do a demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| which we generally do not like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| or the owner would end up in a situation where that would be the only option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| So basically having a program like this allows us to restore life where there's not any other answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| because the economics of the project don't work without the pilot, and that's the key element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| The economics are just upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| It would cost any possible outcome for the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| would produce fewer funds that would be expended on making it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Therefore, it would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Okay, so this is a way that we increase the revenue in the city without raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Yes, no taxes are raised, and, of course, no city funds go into either one of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| These are, when you talk about a pilot, you're talking about deferring taxes that would come in otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2934)|
| 0:49:03| And, of course, another advantage is we have existing infrastructure that's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| so we don't have any costs involving infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| And a final advantage to having this is having just the restoration of life to a core area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2951)|
| 0:49:23| increasing, even if there are few units, any increase in the number of housing units is a plus overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| for housing availability and affordability long term all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| I know that we need housing at many different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| I guess what my concern, and I think the concern of a lot of the public is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| is that it feels like even though we're not giving money because it's just we're not receiving a payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| it feels that we're giving public assistance to groups that may not need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| Well, one way to look at it, I think, is the project needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| And people really have to have a significant degree of resource to be able to take on, to get loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| to be able to even develop any building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| So it's not that the individual may or may not need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| It's that the project itself won't work without the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| That's how it's evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| And that the rate of return that comes from this, part of the third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| is what to be expected for that amount of risk and that amount of investment in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| We depend on our third-party reviewer to get us to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| So my knowledge of this location is that at least one, and I believe two projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| have attempted to develop this existing historic building and have failed at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| And so I think that is why I support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| is because there's something that's actually going to have traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| I'm not sure if the others in the past applied for a pilot or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| I know it was owned by one local architect, and I think it passed on from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| because they weren't able to, whoever had the project wasn't able to make their project go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| I think it's a challenging location because it is an area where things were cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| and raised when the interstate came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| And this may be a question for Don, Michelle Foster, or Mr. Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| When looking at a project like this, so we're looking at right now that location creates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| or generates for the city and the county combined over $7,000 in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| We could not approve this pilot, and the project cannot go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| and it will stay at that status quo, or if the building gets demolished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| it would potentially go lower even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| But we could approve this pilot, and potentially in 15 years we would increase by $34,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| that tax amount, and increase what's coming into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| That's city and county combined, that $34,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Don, Michelle Foster, Director of Redevelopment, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| That's the combined new taxes based on the new appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Okay, and there is the possibility, not that it, I don't know how often it's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| there's also the possibility with a pilot that it could end sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| and it wouldn't be the full 15 years. Is that ever within the realm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| That's the case with the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Oh, with the TIF. So with the pilot it's 15, and it's set, and it stays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| I think what's important about this is that we had, the city had invested something in that building before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| with a facade improvement, and then it sat vacant for numerous years after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| It sits on a key corner going into a gateway entryway into our new north central streetscape project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| and so we think it's a key element to get redeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| and also sitting across from the new Knox High development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| Well, and I shared with Mr. Nash yesterday that people living right there across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| were asking me what was going to happen to that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and at the moment I spoke to them I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| I learned after the fact from you like a week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| People are looking for something to happen there and looking for businesses to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| and I think that's a key part of the success is it's not just residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| it's not just commercial, it's a mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| and it's going to tie the areas of town that have been severed by the interstate together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| and refill something that's been vacant since the 60s at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| It's taking care of that existing building and then two vacant lots adjoining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| Thank you. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| All right, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3217)|

| 0:54:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| Okay, so that is an amendment to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| Did we read this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Did you want to do anything like that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| We did not read it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| So, do we need to read it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| No, we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Well, I do want to make a statement after we've voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| I just wanted to say I support Councilwoman McKenzie's emergency motion to do that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| we've had these folks come down to both public property naming committee and we had to delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| this and so I'd like to go ahead and get it passed and get it in motion for them so they don't have to wait any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| And one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| I'm sure Council will be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3337)|
| 0:55:47| You're welcome to come back any time, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| We love having you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Yes, we love having a full house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| So, one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| This will pass on the emergency, which means it goes into effect immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| However, we still have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| What I've talked to Councilwoman McKenzie before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| We still have to make the sign and then typically we like to have an official unveiling of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| So, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| So, it really won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| It just means you don't have to come back for second reading, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| But we'll expect, you know, work with people's schedules with Mrs. Davis and the church and family and with Councilwoman McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3377)|
| 0:56:26| and schedule a time for the official unveiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| So, you won't see a sign up officially until we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| So, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| So, we'll vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Do you want to vote and then you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| This is first the motion to amend on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Thank you, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| So, we'll vote on that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| The motion to amend to pass it on emergency passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| And now the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| And that motion passes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Let me first say that we are honored to be able to show our appreciation to the late Pastor David James H. Davis in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3427)|

| 0:57:25| We want to recognize Pastor Evans and First Lady Ashley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| For those of you who did not have the honor or the privilege to ever meet or know Pastor Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| he was a beloved figure not only in his community but also in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| He gave of himself especially to young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| He brought a lot of young people in off the streets and brought them to be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| And it brought into a life of Christianity and into the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| His impact was so phenomenal in the city that July 29, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| then Mayor Bill Haslam recognized James Davis Day on that particular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| And so that serves as a testimony to all of the good works that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| And so that serves as a testimony to all of the good works that he put into this city and that he gave of himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| I would like to recognize First Lady Jackie Davis and ask her if she would like to come up and say a few words on behalf of her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3505)|

| 0:58:55| I wrote something. It's not going to take me long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| Would you pull the microphone a little closer, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| I could talk all day about my husband, but I'm not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| But I just wanted to say to everyone here that he spent his entire saved life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| trying to show people who they were in Christ and how blessed they are of God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3554)|
| 0:59:26| by first telling them and showing them who Christ is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| He wanted to show people how to be a light in a lost and a dying world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3571)|
| 0:59:39| by empowering them and equipping them with the word of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| He tried to demonstrate from his own lifestyle that if God could save Junebug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| and if God could bless Junebug and show Junebug how he could make a difference from the inside out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3591)|

| 1:00:04| He had a love for people that I had never, ever seen before I met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| And so the vision, probably if we get a chance after of Eternal Life Harvest Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| the vision statement of Eternal Life Harvest Center Church is not something that he just wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| No, it was something that he believed in and he tried to flesh out his entire Christian life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| So on behalf of myself and my children, I don't know if they want to say anything, but I ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| my children and the entire Eternal Life Church family, I want to say thank you for honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| not just a great man of God, but an awesome husband, father and friend. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3643)|

| 1:03:17| Thank you, Mayor. I hope everyone will bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| This is part of a project that has quite a history with this council and in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| and so I just wanted to make a few statements and then invite Patrick Birmingham if he had anything to add from Covenant to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3808)|
| 1:03:39| So this is a project that has a little bit of a challenging history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| and it is related to a hospital expansion, Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center in the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| And I actually feel great about today about recommending this for approval or making a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| because I think that the process that's happened over the past several months has really started a new dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3839)|
| 1:04:07| between the hospital and the neighborhood and the city and Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| and all of those players have been really important in that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| There are several stakeholders that we've had to kind of balance some goals and interests that sometimes have been in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| The hospital has over a hundred year presence in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| and is really trying to provide the best high quality health care with some really outdated facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3871)|
| 1:04:40| The health care market, and with a background in public health I can attest to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| the health care market in our country has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| The health care market in our region is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| and finding ways to maintain adequate services for the entire region in a centralized location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| is I think of critical importance to the hospital and its board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| Obviously the Fort Sanders neighborhood, historic neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| the historic Fort Sanders neighborhood association is a very important stakeholder in this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| and the homeowners and residents of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Quality of life issues have been a long term concern in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| and the state of the homes that are on the property has been a concern to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| and they've really fallen into some disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| The loss of the neighborhood grocery store is important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| Having a parking garage in the midst of their neighborhood is obviously a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| and there have been questions about expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| When will it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Is there a day when the expansion will stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| So those are also very legitimate and important concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| Knox Heritage has an interest in the history of the homes on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| and I think for our entire city the fact that this particular parcel is in a conservation overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| making sure to preserve that has been important and I could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| The Faulkners have identified some Civil War,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| the evidence of this being a Civil War site and that's a concern that needs to be balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3980)|
| 1:06:27| Obviously as a city we want to make sure that we have well paying jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| and health care is a place where those jobs happen and on a bus line, which is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| So all of those interests are important and have been considered over the past several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| We've had meetings between the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| and I just want to give a shout out to Randall DeFord and Amadou Saul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| from the Historic Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| I don't believe they're here tonight, but they've been active participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Patrick Birmingham from Covenant has been very responsive and engaged on this throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4017)|
| 1:07:06| Todd Morgan from Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Dr. Bill Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| We've had several meetings about this project and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| So out of this process, and again thank you for bearing with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| but for those who have been on council prior to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| I know you know that this is an important issue to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| So some agreements that have been reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| The NC1 overlay is going to remain in place and is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| I think that was an important agreement to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| I think that was important not just for this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| but for folks who are interested in preserving the history of our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| across the city and the character of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| The garage design is meeting those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| It's already been through the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| and it has been designed to meet the NC1 standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| Covenant is conveying a lot at 1815 Highland to Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| and has agreed to pay the cost of relocating one of the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| And Knox Heritage will work on preserving that home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| and turn it into an owner-occupied home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I'll talk about one of the other homes in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| Covenant is working with Knox Heritage, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| and the neighborhood to allow the relocation of the other two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Dr. Lyons may want to comment on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| but I feel really optimistic about at least one of those houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| and a plan for being able to save that house, relocate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| and really make both at least two of the homes a real asset to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4126)|
| 1:08:55| Fort Sanders and Children's Hospital are working to establish a medical district footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| And I talked with Mr. Seymour, Arthur Seymour, just before this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| and I know that that is continuing to move forward as a plan to have a zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| a medical zone, so that everyone knows sort of this is the boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| This is what we're working within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| It's more predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Covenant is working with the UT Archaeology Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| and working out the details and costs of an archaeological inventory of the site prior to breaking ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| and has agreed to provide an ongoing point of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| to address neighborhood concerns throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| So in the end, this agreement is not perfect for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| I mean, I guess that's the sign of a good agreement is that everybody's giving something up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| and people feel a little bit uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| But the reality is that I think that all the way around there are things to celebrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4190)|
| 1:09:57| and I think everyone is ready to move forward and continue a dialogue about the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| of course, for health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| But in my district, the future of the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| with the Cumberland Avenue redevelopment, the dynamic in Fort Sanders is shifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| I think there are some real opportunities there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| and I'm really thankful to Dr. Lyons and David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| We are going to be continuing to meet with the historic Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| and those residents to talk about issues like noise and trash and parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| that have all been ongoing quality of life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| We're already, I think we've heard reports sort of anecdotally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| that there are opportunities for more diversity in that neighborhood around young professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| and people who work at the hospital who would want to walk to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| And so I think there are some real opportunities in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| and I cannot tell you how grateful I am to everyone involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| including Covenant, the historic Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Knox Heritage, and our city administration for working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| through what I think has been a successful process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180717?start=4279)|
