| 0:25:13| Applebee's 53 16 Central Avenue Pike okay on January of 2016 you were cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| for sale to a minor TV TABC hearing was held and there was no further action by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| us and then in January of 2017 you were cited again and so you sent your revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| remedial plan and a $500 fine so how are we going to be sure that we do not see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| you again for a third violation and that's what we've continued our diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| and our policies that we have with Applebee's with QRC you know ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| with this last time it happened it was a 23 year veteran employee bartender for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| 23 years that has been with us she knew the policy she as it was a key hourly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| for us she she even upheld the policy she knew better she just elected not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| follow the policy at this given time unfortunately we did have to let that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| employee go and she's no longer with us even after 23 years of employment and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| think you know I've had some conversations and you know ultimately I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| personally would like if there would be any way to have the employee have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| little bit more of a punishment because just in our experience they know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| policies they know they're going to lose their job and they've signed the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| we've all the videos everything which I've included in our remedial plan but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| it just comes down to it's a very minor penalty in their eyes and they end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| you know moving on to another restaurant two weeks later after they after we let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| them go and still serve me all right does anybody have any thoughts on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| matter well well your microphone up please are you gonna comment I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1623)|
| 0:27:21| have any other plans for them going forward I just thought we should give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| them give them another shot if they mess up and come back then might send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| them on okay I assume you can have a corporate policy that has them forfeit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1649)|
| 0:27:37| their wage or something for the week or what I don't know whatever you I assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| if it's part of your part of your own plan of action that they you know buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| into the personnel manual I guess I guess you could have your own internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| sanction of some sort I don't know yeah better ask a lawyer but I think is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| and what is the fine for the employee on their end of it as well is it $50 fine or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| something like that I believe so I don't know sergeant tower shaking his head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| there's none from the city that I'm aware of it just goes to the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1692)|

| 0:28:28| would be through Sessions Court yes they do no typically when they go to court I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| think that if they've not had any more trouble that is usually dismissed if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| city court finds them the maximum is $50 that's set by the state legislature and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1722)|

| 0:30:13| again and we only want to go there to eat and drink so if that's all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| with the beer board there'll be no further action mr. stair thank you thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| you chair I had a question these were either of these sales to involving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| self-serve wine that his drink has self-serve for wine is that correct no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| no yeah we do have self-serve we do have wine but they didn't involve wine okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| yeah how do y'all man how do you manage the self-serve wine in terms of Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1839)|
| 0:30:49| Burleson 5800 Woodburn Drive with Bistro by the tracks and drink drink is a wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| bar on the side right of Bistro by the tracks the only way to use a our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| machines which we have for self dispensing of wine you have to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| basically it's a gift card that runs the machines so the machines can know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| how much how much to ring up so in order to get one of those gift cards you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| to go through the bartender you have to present ID and payment or means of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| payment and that's when you would be given a card which would be allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| slide into the machine so there is a 100% stop gap between being using the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| machine you have to go through a bartender who is going to card you at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| that moment okay we're dealing with this on the beer side so I just thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| since they were here we could we could see what they were doing so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| immediately got a phone call from the new Sentinel that day and this came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| and we had no comment how do you know they're not having too many self-serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| I mean is there a limit on the card or something no how do you know the card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| isn't given to someone else that is a opportunity for improvement you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| obviously in our small controlled environment no one is going in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| the door the bartenders are managing the floor you are correct in that the card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| could be given away we pretty much operate the drink side of be sure by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| tracks as a 21 and over is what we we would invite everyone else to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and go home all right thank you your board you want to take any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1938)|
| 0:32:25| action or are we good thank you Bravo Casino Italiana this essentially is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1945)|
| 0:32:43| because of the TABC requirement we've dealt with you TABC really dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| you for 48 days and substantial fine so essentially tonight we're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1970)|

| 0:33:17| significant loss of income this particular business has taken quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| hit at least in the range of 38,000 and liquor sales loan that's not including a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2002)|

| 0:34:52| so put your listening ears in high gear the gracious mr. Johnson and Angela in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2092)|

| 0:35:14| over the board there is no consistency at all from one location to another so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| think mr. frost we're going to be sharing that we're going to be emailing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| that to you and that will answer some questions and then we can decide if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| want to increase fines if we want to do away with fines or what we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| the second item that came up was when people go beyond the 90 days what do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| do and our 90 days of extension yeah what do we do and one thought was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170228?start=2139)|
