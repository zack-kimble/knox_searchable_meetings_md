| 0:01:26| Many of the items we vote on require further action by the city council or county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| and in the handout is the meeting schedule of these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| For matters that are forwarded to county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| the applicant must be present at the county commission meeting at which the request will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=103)|

| 0:01:58| I'd also like to refer you to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning's outstanding website, www.knoxplanning.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=118)|
| 0:02:07| for an online agenda and additional information on this and future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| Today's meeting will be conducted in the order of the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| Now, a word about how discussion will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| After each item is called, I will read the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=149)|
| 0:02:38| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=158)|

| 0:02:47| The opposition will also be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| If either side wishes to rebut, you will need to reserve time from your allotted five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| Speakers should limit their remarks to the facts of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| and should avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item are asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=205)|

| 0:13:32| I live at 5012 Cane Road, and I would like to have item 14-C heard separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=812)|

| 0:13:53| I've already contacted my councilwoman about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| and we stand in agreement that sidewalks would be very beneficial down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| We'll hear that at its regularly scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=845)|
| 0:14:26| Okay. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Hello. My name is Ann Pickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| I live at 313 Echo Dale Lane in South Knoxville, and I would like to have number 8, Mill Vista, heard at its regular order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=869)|
| 0:14:39| The reason is I have just one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| Our neighborhood just found out about this a week or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I have one or two small questions that I was not able to get answered in the time allotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Absolutely. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| We will hear that at its regularly scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Is there anyone else, and I don't see any lights on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Motion to hear consent is read with the exceptions of number 8 and number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=900)|

| 0:15:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=921)|

| 0:15:27| I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=931)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| We are on to agenda item number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=965)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| I am going to have Mr. Green present this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the commission, members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| The ordinance amendment is to amend the Knox County Zoning Ordinance to define public safety facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| and to identify zoning districts in which they are permitted by right or permitted as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| This ordinance amendment was initiated by a question from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| A member of the public wanted to know where rescue squad stations could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| We looked at our existing zoning ordinance and public safety facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Rescue squads, emergency facilities are not identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Fire stations are identified, I think, as an afterthought as a public utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| which is probably not the place most of us would look for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| and they are not permitted in all zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| So this zoning ordinance amendment would define public safety facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| and I want to amend the definition just a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| so I would ask that if you approve or recommend approval of this ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| do you approve the definition revision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| The definition would be a public safety facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| a facility operated by and for the use of public safety agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| such as the fire and emergency rescue services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| including the dispatch, storage, and maintenance, and it states police and fire vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| but I would delete police and fire and insert emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| That definition would clear up the question of what are public safety facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| and include those facilities which are necessary to serve the members of the public in times of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| The zone regulations would amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| first amend the definition of public utilities to delete fire stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| from the definition of public utilities since it's covered under public safety facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| The public safety facilities are proposed as a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| and the residential districts as a permitted use as in all the non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| The standard for the use on review would be that the road that provides access to the public safety facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| shall be deemed by the staff to be capable of accommodating traffic generated by the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| and the second one is that the public safety facility be barfed from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| and agricultural zones by type A landscape screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| as identified in the landscape screening design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| The first standard is to ensure that those vehicles accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| and leaving the public safety facility can be accommodated by the street system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| or road system in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| The second one is to ensure that there's minimal disturbance if it's in a residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| that there's minimal disturbance of the adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the proposed amendment to the Knox County zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| as read by Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| What's the amendment to the definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| As read by Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Oh, thank you. Just clarifying. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Buston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| to approve as read by the Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I do not see any lights on. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| We are now on to agenda item number eight, Mill Vista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| This is a subdivision report concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| The applicant developer is Landmark Engineers and Surveyors, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| The location is the northeast side of West Martin Mill Pike, north of Brown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Approximate acreage is 9.75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Current zoning is R1, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| The proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| The number of lots is 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Subdivision variance is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| And there is one subdivision variance required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| The staff recommendation is to approve the concept plan for 20 detached residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| on individual lots subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| And I believe there's opposition or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Sir, would you like to go first or the woman with questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1249)|
| 0:21:14| Who would like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| Okay, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| And just once again, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| The name is Ann Pickens at 313 Echo Dale Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| My question is I've looked at the plans enough to know that the planned access to this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| is all from Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| The only remaining question that I have is there's a note on one of the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| and it was a little bit difficult to read even online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| that there's an alternative access proposed for, I can't remember the lot numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| and I'm wondering where that access comes from and what it goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| Our main concern in the Echo Dale Lane neighborhood is that there be no access to this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| via Wise Hills and Echo Dale Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Sir, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Mark Driver, Landmark Engineers, Surveyors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| The access currently proposed is from Martin Mill only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| There is an existing driveway easement crossing a couple parcels to the, I guess that would be the northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1346)|
| 0:22:37| and the client is certainly going to continue allowing that access to those three parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1357)|
| 0:22:46| There is no proposed access from Echo Dale Lane on this concept plan for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1366)|
| 0:22:57| I was unaware that there's actually the ability to access the property from Echo Dale Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| It would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| So it sounds like the Echo Dale Lane is there on the east and the driveway access is on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Does that answer your question, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| No, I just wanted to, like I said, I just wanted to make sure that there was no access via Echo Dale Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| The only thing that leads to that property from Echo Dale Lane is an old logging trail, a dirt road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| and Echo Dale Lane, that neighborhood, just isn't built for that kind of subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| So it sounds like your question was answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Thank you for coming in and asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Do either of you have anything else you want to say or are we ready to vote on it, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Motion to approve the concept plan for 20 detached residential units on individual lots subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| We've got a variance first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| The variance, it's not a variance, it's a waiver, and we just put those in there just to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| the waivers are approved administratively through the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| They're just listed because they're similar to a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| On to agenda number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| This is the Gables at Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| Applicant developer is Homestead Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| The location is the east end of Old Kent Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Approximate acreage is 18.94 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| The current zoning is R1 low-density residential and F1 floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Existing land use is vacant land, and the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| Number of lots is 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| There are no subdivision variances required, and the staff's recommendation is to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| for 27 detached residential units on individual lots subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| And so, Mr. King, do you want to go first, or do you want to hear from opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| You name an address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| My name is Leslie Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| I live at 6906 Old Kent Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| The property that I own at 6906 Old Kent Drive is not assigned on their concept plan as belonging to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| If you look at the concept plan, my lot is stamped as belonging to Ann Bonneman, but that's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| It's Leslie Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| This piece of property that I own has a lawful easement on it, and there's only one way in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| and I'm using the gravel driveway that accesses to my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| I've had questions and concerns over this proposed subdivision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| I've had an attorney reach out and try to ask my questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| but I've not gotten any response that I know of as of last night when I talked to the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Nobody has contacted me about what they propose to do with the easement that I currently own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and I would really like to get a survey done to see where my property lines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| and to talk with the engineers and find out more about the paved road that they're going to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| So I respectfully ask that you guys wait until I have time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| I need a postponement and time to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| I'm a school teacher. I teach kindergarten. I cannot be late to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| My kindergartners are not going to be happy if they're waiting on me, so I really need time to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| This is my most valuable asset, and I really want to protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| Also, it would be best, I think, for the developer and the engineer to sit down and talk with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| at least have a discussion with me about what they're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Okay. Thank you. I know that there's other people that want to speak to this, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I'm Gail Jarvis. I live at 6916 Stone Mill Drive, Knox Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| I live in what we consider and is often known as Historic Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| There have been a lot of buildings over the years surrounding us attracted to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| because our area is so attractive, and we want to keep it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| Our entrance, of course, is the water wheel that's often used for people to get married at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| It's that desirable a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| We had, in good faith, had some of our residents meet with some of the people involved with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1689)|
| 0:28:22| and quite frankly, our community isn't real happy with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| We feel like we are David and Goliath, but we're David without a rock in our sling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| because we did not have legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Now, many, many times I had folks appear in front of me when I was a general sessions judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| and a juvenile magistrate, unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| I urged them to get representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| I find that when people have a lawyer representing their interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| not the developer's interest, not the plaintiff's interest, or whomever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| is bringing the action to the body of decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| that everybody can walk away at least feeling like, well, okay, we got heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| because our lawyer tells us blah, blah, blah about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Now, I'm not here representing the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| I'm really here representing my interest as a landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| and we need an attorney who's at least half as conversant as our fine gentleman John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1768)|
| 0:29:38| You're not going to find a lawyer like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Do you know John King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| And so feeling like David with the Goliath without a rock in our sling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| we were asking for time to get equipped to deal with this on a more professional level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1790)|
| 0:29:59| not because we want to go into litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| We just want to come to the table and really get our side heard in a way saying, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| we made our best efforts, and they also made their best efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| and we don't think we're there yet, and we don't see what the rush to judgment is because, after all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| this is a big builder, has construction going on all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| We're one small little community with a great heritage that we would like to try and maintain some semblance of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1830)|
| 0:30:39| and we ask for time to have our attorney represent not for litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| Who knows what? That's not our aim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Our aim is to have a voice at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| and we would very respectfully request that this be postponed and let us prepare with our own counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1851)|
| 0:31:04| It dovetails, although it is not the same issue as Leslie's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| and she's actually down the hill from us in the bedroom community next door, but she is really impacted hugely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1870)|
| 0:31:20| Our streets are tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Another subdivision around us has much larger streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| but our subdivision has little tiny streets without shoulders, without sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| and as it is now, when the mailman comes down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| we have to kind of stop and let him get us by us or knock down the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you, Ms. Jarvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you for your consideration, and thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Yes, sir. Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| My name is Russell Rackley, Rackley Engineering, PO Box 30456, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I'm just going to speak to Ms. Fields' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| After last month's meeting, when you all postponed this project, I met with Ms. Fields outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| I got her number and sent her my contact information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| and about a week later on March 25th, I got a call from Steve Lusk, who is an attorney out of Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| that whether a friend of hers representing her, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| he was asking her concerns about the trees along the gravel driveway that is in the permanent access easement on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| and I informed him at the time that once we have concept approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| and we move into detailed design engineering that we would have the front of her property surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| along with locating the trees and that no trees that reside on her property would be harmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| Now, trees that are in the easement, which is on our property, I'm not for certain yet whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| Obviously, we'd like to save every one we can, but until we get into that level of design, there's no way to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| So I have been communicating with her attorney as it relates to the timing of this after we get the concept plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| In regards to the note on the concept plan with the prior owner's name on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| that was an oversight by my surveyor on the underlay survey that I used to put the concept plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| Obviously, that will be corrected prior to any final plat, which is where it really makes a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| and I'll reserve the rest of the time for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| I'm going to speak briefly to the postponement, which I understand the request is, not necessarily opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| Excuse me, sir. Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| I'm John King, 620 Market Street in Auxill, Tennessee, here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| We were here last month, and the matter was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| We opposed the postponement at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| This matter is like all others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| It was posted, known, and people were aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| We had communication with representatives of the homeowners' groups before last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| We certainly have had some since last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| There's been adequate time to engage the services of whatever consultant somebody might want to engage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2049)|
| 0:34:18| and we would definitely be opposed to postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I'll speak to the other issues when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| I think we are at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Did you want to speak to other issues? Was there other issues you needed to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| If you're going to get discussion of the application itself prior to voting on the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2079)|
| 0:34:47| I'll go ahead and do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| I don't think that we're voting on a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| We're discussing the agenda item, and there has been no motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| As I said before, I'm John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I have Brian Mone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I have, of course, Mr. Rackley here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| This matter was postponed from the March meeting to give an opportunity for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| to have more discussion with the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| Since that occurred, that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| There was a meeting on March 27th at 3 p.m. to which representatives of the three homeowners groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| were a number of people there, and I won't go over them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| but Culver Schmidt, Bart Carey, Mr. Cole, Amy Morton, Ann Myers, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| The issues discussed at that time, number one, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| There was a question about whether we could have a construction entrance way off of Balm Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| I think Mr. Rackley dealt with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| That's simply not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| The intervening property is in private ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| There's a creek involved that would have to be crossed and dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| It's not an acceptable alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| We did agree to make up some signs for the neighborhood that they could then put in yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| advising people about speed limits, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| We don't have the right to put them in anybody's yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| but we can have them available if anybody wants them to go put in their yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| There was a discussion from Bart Carey about trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| We advised then, as we advise now, that we're going to be in compliance with the city's tree ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2201)|
| 0:36:51| We'll be using the trees as that ordinance dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| Then we'll be placing trees to best enhance the community we develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| and at that time there will be opportunities for trees perhaps around the perimeter and other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| In essence, we'll be following the city tree ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| There was a question about covenants and restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| We've redone covenants and restrictions and included a number of things that Culver Schmidt was working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2235)|
| 0:37:24| We worked on that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| That's in place to be recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| We were asked to reach out to Mrs. Betty Allen, an adjoining property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| We had made that contact, and the groups I know had a subsequent meeting a week later to which we were not advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2259)|
| 0:37:50| Thank you so much, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I don't know what the result was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| We would ask in this instance, the staff recommends approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| We comply with every requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| We would ask that you not postpone the matter and approve an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| My question is about the easement that's been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Is this an easement that has a description?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| Is it in a specific area, and is it bound, a location-based description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| or is it simply an easement that says Ms. Fields has a right to ingress and egress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| No, it is a permanent access easement that gives the underlying property owner the right to convert that easement into a right-of-way at will at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2309)|
| 0:38:40| And you plan on, whatever you do, you're going to honor her easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| And you're legally bound to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We're legally bound to maintain her access to her house, to her driveway where it resides at the end of her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| which is at the far end of the easement from Old Kent Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| And we will maintain, it's a gravel drive now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| We'll maintain gravel access until such time as we can pave road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| and she will have public right-of-way access to the new road proposed on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| And you can see I'm showing her driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| That's the approximate location of her driveway and how it will connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| and put a split in the boulevard section there for her to egress out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| So she will not be unable to access her property at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| She will not be unable to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| She will never be unable to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| There will be times during paving and such that we'll have to coordinate closely as far as the one or two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| You'll want to file the road and move her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I think that we heard last month we heard from two attorneys that were there not representing the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2384)|
| 0:39:51| but were there speaking for the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| Last month I just didn't see there was a whole lot of benefit of postponing 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| but we were persuaded that it would be better if the neighborhood could have discourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| with the developer and try to iron some things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| I didn't feel like there was a lot of bend and give that was going to happen during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| and apparently they've come to some resolutions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| We've got an applicant that's asking for a fraction of what the density could be on the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| He does have sidewalks that are in the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| It's one of the conditions of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| One of the conditions of approval is a greenway easement down Fourth Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| in cooperation with the City of Knoxville Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| I'm really having a hard time figuring out why we'd want to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| Again, I just don't see that anybody gains anything by a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Let's get it going and get the construction part of this over with as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| so everybody's lives aren't disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| So I make a motion that we approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| for 27 detached residential units on individual lots subject to the 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| We have a second by Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| I do want to bring up one request that we also received via e-mail that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| when you folks met with the homeowners you had talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| and come to an agreement about not doing any construction work on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| No, we discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Our position is we'll follow the City Noise Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| As far as working times, the City Noise Ordinance does not designate days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| We do not encourage nor require any contractors either during the land development stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| or home construction to work on Sundays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| but they all have a deadline and a job to do and due to rain and other things there is that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| I understand from our esteemed attorney that we cannot add that as a condition anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I just wanted to say one other thing before we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| That is that I see a lot of people that are here in opposition, some of which are friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| This property, I don't want anyone to feel like they were run over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| but the property is zoned and when the property is zoned for this use and they submit a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| and the plan conforms with the zoning, we're really limited in being able to turn anything down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| That property owner has certain rights for approval when they comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| And the property has been zoned like this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| I would say that if this developer was trying to rezone to a different zone or plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| this would be a different ballgame and they probably would get crushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| But in this case, we simply don't have a lot of ways to deny this, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| So I just wanted you guys to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| So we do have a motion on the table and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2591)|
| 0:43:20| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Additionally, I'd like to add to Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| we did postpone this in good faith that the developer would get together with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| It sounds like you did and you had a really fruitful discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| And we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Like I said before, I think that when you include the community, everybody wins in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| So I'm in agreement with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Okay, I don't see any of the lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Although Commissioner Clancy, Commissioner Buston, lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2638)|

| 0:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| I believe Commissioner Clancy, I cut you off before you got your motion out of your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| If you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2835)|

| 0:48:09| Next on our agenda is item number 26 that was pulled from the postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2889)|

| 0:48:34| Tract information is 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| The present plan designation is LDR low density residential and HP hillside and ridgetop protection agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2917)|
| 0:48:48| The proposed plan designation is GC general commercial and HP hillside and ridgetop protection PC plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2928)|
| 0:48:57| Existing land use is agriculture, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| The proposed use is a themed resort containing approximately 150 acres with amenity spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| The staff recommendation is to postpone the plan amendment until the May 9, 2019 planning commission meeting as per applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2949)|
| 0:49:21| Also to recommend the postponement of the rezoning until the May 9, 2019 planning commission meeting as per the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2961)|
| 0:49:32| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| I requested this to be taken off the postponement list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| This would be the fourth postponement coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| I don't even want to talk about the rezoning or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| My idea is that I think we should put this on the table and table it, give them up to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3001)|
| 0:50:12| They come in with the same letter every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| We were supposed to hear this in February, March, April, now May, that they're working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| That's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| But apparently they need more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| I think the neighborhood would like to have this not hanging over their head every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3030)|
| 0:50:44| Are we going to go to MPC and hear this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| Give them time when the applicant feels that he's ready to come in here any time within the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| All they have to do is notify us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| We'll vote on taking it off the table, and they'll be heard the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| I think it would be easier on our staff, easier on the applicant, and easier on the people that are in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3066)|
| 0:51:16| And it'd save a tree without having to do the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| I move that this item 26 be tabled for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf and a second by Commissioner Clancy to table this for one year, or just table it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3092)|
| 0:51:43| The rules are for one year, so we don't have to take it, just tabling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Yes, so to table this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| I don't see any lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3113)|

| 0:52:08| Item number 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| This is a rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| The applicant is Thomas Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| The location is the southwest side of Coram Road, southeast of Billy Neal Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| Approximate size of the tract is 4.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| The present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Zoning requested is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| The existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Proposed use is tiny house subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| Staff recommends that the county commission approve the PR planned residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| The applicant requested PR up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I believe this is one that was postponed from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| At the time last month, there was some photographs that were presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| Is that this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| That's correct, and those photographs showed a great deal of debris and trash on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| Those photographs were provided by the county codes enforcement department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| and the last word I have from that department is they're taking action to work with the property owner to have it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3211)|

| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3223)|

| 0:53:52| I'm only going to take up a short amount of time because our neighbors are also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| We have questions having to do with the we see that the property is being cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| We don't exactly know by who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| We wanted to ask questions of this applicant, and he wasn't here last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| The questions that we have have to do with has the applicant contacted the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3247)|
| 0:54:16| to ask about the pond that's there, the existing pond, which is in a watershed that goes through several other persons' properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| We have concerns about what exactly this person intends to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| Are they planning on being the builder or the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| If they are the developer, have they thought about the fact that this property has no public sewer available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3274)|
| 0:54:42| What are they going to do about the septic systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| There is now currently an open septic system on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| We're concerned about the experience and the financial resources this individual has behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3289)|
| 0:55:00| because we've seen the quality of the work that has been done so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| and we did bring the photographs last time to show you what the quality of the applicant's work is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3304)|
| 0:55:13| as far as to just sort of take the trash and plow it under the dirt instead of having it removed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| There was a whole bunch of tires and debris in the pond that's there existing and shared by two other property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| The dam that they used to actually access the property is actually made of debris and of tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| I don't know if anybody was aware of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| and we'd like to see what an environmental conservation agency has to say about the impact on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| Our neighbor was nice enough to take pictures of how the only entrance to the property where this planned...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| Who can I give this to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| If you'll observe the picture on the top right corner, that's the only entrance to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| from which we understand there's only maybe 20 feet, if that, the frontage to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| You might also notice that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Can I have a... Can there be a picture, please, of the entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| That's the entrance, which is on a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| We're exactly adjacent to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| We have fencing that's been crashed into now four different times that we've had to repair the fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| because people drive too quickly and it's too curvy of a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| If that is the proposed entrance to this subdivision, you can all see that it's on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| The entrance is literally on a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3405)|
| 0:56:55| Right now, they talk about that this property is located in a planned growth area and a growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| but it's still now zoned as agriculture, which is everybody around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| And so, really, even though that's the plan in the future, right now, there is no subdivisions like this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3428)|
| 0:57:20| We have some big concerns with regards to the way that this property has already been cared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| and especially with regards to the sewer because if they're going to install septics for three or five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3445)|
| 0:57:34| there is already a watershed there that, like I said, carries to other properties all across the back of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3454)|
| 0:57:43| I'm going to let our neighbors speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| We wanted to have the applicant answer some questions for us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| Hi. I'm Jennifer DeLair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| I live at 618 Coram Road with my parents, and they've lived there for probably about 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| I think our biggest concern, we're not against the community being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| because obviously our roads would get better, but that's my question, who's going to fix the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| because it is such a tiny road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| All of Coram Road is small, and we want to know who's going to fix it, the road, to widen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| to increase that number of traffic if we're going to have, you know, 12 to 15 families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| I want to know, are they going to have the septic, or are they going to try and go by with a compost toilet system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| So we really want to make sure it's a developed property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| and not something that's just thrown up there that, you know, we had meth houses in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| so we don't want that to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Is there anyone else in opposition that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| My name is Thomas Driscoll, 1414 Graytown Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| That's my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I brought handouts for the chairmen if they want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| If you guys don't mind me bringing them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| If you would give it to Mr. Breschke right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| There's 14 packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| We certainly understand and appreciate the concerns of those who value their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| and it's typically any person's large investment is their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| and we're more than sensitive and respectful to maintain the standards they have set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and we go beyond adding value to their property and the surrounding community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| While the homes will have a smaller footprint, the development will also include green spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| and other open-looking parcels versus a simply dense look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| I'm from the local area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| I was born and raised here in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| and I want nothing more for the community than to continue to add to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| I'm not just an outside investor looking to make a quick buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| This is my first development, so I haven't done everything maybe in the exact typical order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| but we are moving forward and do have a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| So we've been in contact with the developers of Richmond Orchard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| and they support the idea of a sister community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| Both Joan Monaco and Christine Duncan have approved use of their floor plans and design with slight changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3630)|
| 1:00:39| The designs we've chosen can be deviated slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| The footprint is desirable for a number of reasons and also bridges buyer profiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| We've chosen plans with slight options with different designs and slight customizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| We are committed to quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| We've chosen a quality contractor interested in this product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| It's very important because it's unlikely to convince a tier one contractor to do homes this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| because they could choose larger houses instead and maximize their margins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| We're committed to professionalism, as we've already chosen a realtor experienced with this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| and currently has cottages under contract and more potential buyers interested in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| We're committed to efficiency by determining the choice of finishes already installed on the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| to avoid pitfalls from unlimited finishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| We're committed to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| We have financing lined up with a source that understands the new cottage layout and has financed others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| Because it's all coming together, we're now just looking for your blessing to continue forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| But I can address some of the questions you had about the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| we have a civil engineer who has been in contact with LEO at Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| We have plans drawn up for the roads and the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| We've contacted KUB about bringing sewer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| I have my receipts where we paid for soil tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| We have all of our contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| We bought dumpsters, bobcats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| I can hand you guys these receipts, too, if you want to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| It's not 14 copies, but it's just that work's been going on up here since October 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| like four days after my dad passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| And he lived there for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| So, you know, there wasn't much I could do until he did pass away to start on cleaning it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| And we've been working with Junk Be Gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| There's another recycling yard off of Halls that we've worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| I have all the receipts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| The soil tests, the recommended septic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| And, you know, next month's meeting, we would definitely have site plans and all the civil engineering done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| If you guys want to, I brought my realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| She wanted to speak for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| There's a little time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Sure, you've got a minute 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| Hey, I'm Sarah Hurst, and I live at 1800 Chestnut Grove Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| And I'm working with Thomas just to kind of walk through this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| because we're doing something similar that we did in Richmond Orchard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| which is about two miles from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| It was a detached condo concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| So we were able to do them fairly dense because the footprint of the home is 16 feet by 36 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3809)|
| 1:03:38| and it's less than 400 square feet of a footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| So it's super small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| We're in the process of talking to the civil engineers, figuring out the septic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| Everything's going to be done in compliance in a way that is best for the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| and hopefully to help the other neighbors to improve the values of their homes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| We want to improve this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| It's not going to look trashy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| There's nothing going to be left of what was already there when we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| We want to improve this area, create green spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| and we're just in the process of working through all of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| You said, Mr. Driscoll, you said that you are talking with KUB to bring in sewage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| but then at the same time you're saying that you're going to have septic systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| They said there's an option of either sewage if the soil test would come back as a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| to where we can't put a decentralized system in for everyone to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| It's called a community septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I spoke with my engineer and spoke to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| It's a subdivision at the end of Coram Road, Straw Plains and Coram Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| and KUB said it would be the exact same system that they use that they would be able to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| because the property already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| But is it sewage or septic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| KUB can bring in sewage, but also they said if septic, if the soil test comes back positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| then we could do that as an option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| So it would be two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| But there's no compost toilets or tiny house on trailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| It would be like a sister community, a spitting image of Richmond Orchard just in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| I was going to ask more about the septic or sewer thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| but I guess we have to kind of look at this as just an appropriate place for this kind of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| I just have one other thing to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| I wasn't going to raise this issue, but if your idea, Mr. Driscoll, of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3940)|
| 1:05:46| cooperating with the neighbors is to run an ad in Craigslist having, and this is what he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| this is how we first found out, having any strangers just run up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| drive their vehicles up there and pick through all the trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| This was going on for days and days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| If that's your idea of professionalism as far as having it cleaned up, we didn't appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| None of us knew who these people were coming back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Ma'am, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| Basically, my dad lived there for 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| It wasn't just trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| There was a lot of scrap metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| He was a collector of cars and scrap metal because he came from that era and got lucky in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| Prices went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| So the reason for the ad was so that the community could come out and recycle the metal and then the actual trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you, Mr. Driscoll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| I'd like to hear what Mr. Smith had left to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| Well, I was going to say that really regardless of how he cleans it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| it's really a question of is this appropriate, an appropriate area for that kind of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| And if there was a sewer line at the property, then it would make it more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| I think there's a lot of unanswered questions about how that works and about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| I don't I don't see five units an acre here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| I just don't think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| I'm not I'm not saying maybe something less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| But remember, staff's recommendation is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Three. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Anyway, that's that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you. I'm sorry about cutting you off, allowing somebody else to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| So, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| Based on the pictures that we saw last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| I'm not sure that Mr. Driscoll can do anything to make the site worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| I'm pretty sure KUV's not going to bring sewage in, but that probably wouldn't hurt it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| Hopefully they'll bring a sewer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| That that option would be I would rather Mr. Driscoll next month if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| if this gets passed and we go forward, I'd rather hear from your engineer than your realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| But that that being said, I'd like to make a motion that we recommend the county commission approve PR plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| Second, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve her staff recommendation up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| I do not see any other lights on all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Any opposed. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| And he does have to come back next month with a concept plan that we have to review and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| which hopefully he'll have his engineer with him and we can ask some of your all's questions at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| I'm thinking this might help with some of the situation down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Right. Whether it's next month or in the next whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| The next whenever he comes in for his concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| Yes. Next on the agenda is item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Number thirty four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4138)|
| 1:09:13| This is a rezoning report. The applicant is Greg Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| John severe joint venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| The location is the south side of East Governor John severe highway east of Conda Drive west of Arthur Harmon Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| Approximate size of the tract is five point five five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Present zoning is a agricultural zoning requested is PR planned residential existing land uses vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| The proposed use is single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Density proposed is five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Staff recommendation is to recommend that county commission approved planned residential up to five dwelling units per acre zoning subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4189)|
| 1:10:00| Is the applicant present. Is there opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Sir would you like to get first to the opposition. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4204)|
| 1:10:13| Yes sir. Name and address for the record please. Jim Wright Junior 4 2 1 Carla Drive 3 7 9 2 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| Are you the only one that is going to be speaking in opposition. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| I'm here today to represent the neighborhood of Woodfield Park and also some of the adjoining neighbors on Arthur Harmon Road which are asking to deny this petition for up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4226)|
| 1:10:44| If I may I could ask them to stand up just so you know who I was taking the time off the day to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| Also you may have seen we've had a petition started and we've had 65 signatures I think they've been sent in to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| I hope hope you get to see them but there's not one person in the neighborhood is really excited about five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| The posting of the rezoning sign. I want to thank you for sending us this because without this we wouldn't have known about it and I'm sure you hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4268)|
| 1:11:18| One of our main concerns was when this neighborhood was originally designed by Jay Burnett in 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4278)|
| 1:11:28| He designed this as a green space back then. They didn't call it green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| They just called it a barrier between John severe highway and our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| A lot of nice brick homes there. But that was our barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| So that was his intention. Traffic. Y'all hear about that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| We've got a lot of traffic and it's a dangerous intersection where Chapman Highway actually comes on to John severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| There's a merge lane that comes all the way down to our intersection Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| Five days ago there was four people in on the side of the road waiting on an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| A week ago there was a car that flipped over right in front of our intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| And we're talking about maybe bringing in 20 to 27 more units 40 to 50 more cars a day roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| That really kind of concerns us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Like say agricultural zoning is our barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| One one thing that really kind of concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| I haven't seen on your maps this drainage easement that comes from John severe highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| I've lived there for over 20 years when it rains hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| This is like a river and there's a sinkhole down here and it flows right down through here which covers about a third of the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4361)|
| 1:12:53| My concern is I know holding ponds can be put in and what have you retainage ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| But we were sprayed multiple times for West Nile virus last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| So we're not really big on holding ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4385)|
| 1:13:17| And the other thing is you know what's going to happen to the sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Is it going to open up on my property my neighbor's property maybe swallow up a modular home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| I've actually reached out to Mr. Franklin and his his words to me where he had intended on putting 10 units 10 modular homes backing up to John severe and 10 modular units backing up to our our properties which if you approve the five per acre he can legally put in 27 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4406)|
| 1:13:50| We understand it's his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| We get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Knox County is trying to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| We get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| We want to try and be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| Maybe we can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Maybe maybe we could have a Woodfield Park to Woodfield Park addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| We would hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| But we really feel it five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| And the other thing is consistency with our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| All our homes are brick homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| I mean they're nice homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Moving a modular home and we really feel would detract from our our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| So we would just ask that you think about the density and maybe a tree barrier if it does move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| Thank you for your time and thank you for your service to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Do you have something you'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Greg Franklin 1110 World Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| I believe I gave Mike an initial copy of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| I don't know if you guys can put it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| It was about 24 homes that ended up being about four maybe four point two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| Obviously our concept plan would address most of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| We had SME do engineering about on this property about 10 years ago and everything came back on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| It's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| Obviously we repeat all that stuff as we move forward to address them with the modular homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| Not sure where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| There is a modular home neighborhood across the street the village of John severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| I do not build myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| We've talked to a couple of nice single family builders that are interested in coming and taking this home development up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| But other than really just some initial concept plan and lot planning for nice single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| There really hasn't been that much more discussion as far as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| Definitely nothing planned for modular homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| They had asked me about the stuff across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| That's a Clayton homes project that has nothing to do with us although we did do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| We did build out the initial roads for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| Twelve years ago I would argue it's probably one of the nicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| One of the nicer build out subdivisions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| We had nothing to do with the homes that went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Our plan is something very nice and to keep the neighborhood upscale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| Definitely in line with the single family plan that they have probably even larger than some of the stuff that's going on right there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| And Mr. Wright, I'm not sure if you have seen the latest recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| There is a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Part of the recommendation is a 20 foot landscape screen along John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| And then a 35 foot landscape screen along the southern property, which should protect the landscape screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| We have not seen that, but we definitely do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| That was added in as another condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| In our agenda review on Tuesday, I'm looking at this and I know one to five is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| If this was across the street, I think it would be a no brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| The units in this subdivision are about two units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| And Commissioner Graff had mentioned that putting five on this piece of property just didn't seem like it fit with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| And I really tend to agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| I know there's constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I know it's hard to make your development all work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| But I really feel like a less dense development would work better on this side with this neighborhood and with these constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4647)|
| 1:17:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| And I know Commissioner Smith has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| But I'd like to make a motion that we recommend the County Commission approve PR plan residential of up to three dwelling units an acre, subject to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4663)|
| 1:17:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to recommend approval up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4676)|
| 1:18:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| Yeah, I think three is still too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| That's a very nice older subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| We're about protecting existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| I think it's actually built out, we were told Tuesday, at 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| I think two would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| And I wish he would amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4712)|
| 1:18:40| I don't think two will get enough votes and we'll just be back at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| That's kind of what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| We can try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| We do have a current motion on the table and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| There was a comment made at the agenda meeting, I think, by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| And the question was asked, is there a sinkhole on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| Because none of the maps show a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| I'd like to know, is there a sinkhole and how it's going to be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Mr. Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| I can only speak to the engineering we did about ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Could you come to the microphone so we can hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| About ten to twelve years ago we were looking actually at a two-story apartment complex with 56 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| We did an SME initial boring and it was going to support that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| Again, we've done no engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| We're just in the rezoning plan from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| But unless something's changed drastically, to my knowledge, not that the engineering is turned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| County engineering, do you have any other information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| No, I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| The topo doesn't indicate closed contours on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Mr. Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| If I remember from the pre-agenda review, this property actually has all the infrastructure in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| It has the sewer in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| It's right facing, it's right on John's sphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| We have landscape buffers that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| So a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| And it's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| It's not in hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| And as I understand it, the sector plan is already designated as one to five dwelling units for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| So this seems like the perfect place to have up to five dwelling units based on those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| And so I just wanted to follow up with staff at how to tell us again about the recommendation for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4828)|
| 1:20:37| Can I add that our concept plan would not be more than four if that makes a difference to yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| We're at four right now and looking at going larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| So if that makes any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| So the request was for up to five dwelling units per acre planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| As staff, when we were reviewing this, we considered the existing zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| So obviously the existing zoning that is allowed and the development potential that's allowed can be different sometimes than the build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| So, you know, but there is, again, as Commissioner Eason mentioned, water and sewer in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| It's in the planned growth area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| And it's pretty close to a commercial node near John Sevier and Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4882)|
| 1:21:31| So that was the thought process for staff when we were recommending up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| We did recommend three conditions to help with the differences between the existing build out of the R.B. neighborhood in this proposed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4900)|
| 1:21:50| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| I just like to follow up and say I think staff has this exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| Commissioner Graf, you still get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| I think that's just exactly why this needs to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| If it was on the other side of John Sevier Highway, that's a different world on that side of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4928)|
| 1:22:15| It's a big highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| It's not some little country road going down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| And it's two different worlds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| It's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| It's close to the commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| And that's why we should look at protecting it rather than just adding on more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4949)|
| 1:22:39| Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| I'm kind of inclined to agree with Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| I don't see that it's hard to develop property at less than three units an acre and make it viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| And that's not the only reason I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| But I don't know that you're going to do less damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| I mean, you're going to build a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| You're going to grade it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| You're going to clear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Are you going to satisfy two units an acre's worth of homeowners or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| And I think three is a very reasonable compromise between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| So I will support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| I see no other likes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| The only thing that, you know, I'm also in agreement with Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| I went out and spent a lot of time on that property yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| And I just think the effect upon the adjacent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| which is well stated in Article 9 under staff review guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| that any time we rezone a property that we should be looking about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| the effect upon development patterns in the vicinity and the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| And I don't know if you all went out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| but that is a very old neighborhood with large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| And I just don't think it conforms with Article 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| And so I can't support Commissioner Clancy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5037)|
| 1:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| We do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| to approve up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| seconded by Commissioner Phillips, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| Can we do a roll call, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5071)|

| 1:24:47| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5088)|

| 1:24:55| 8-1-2-3-4-5-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| It passes 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| The motion carries 8-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5103)|
| 1:25:16| Next on the agenda is item number 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5116)|
| 1:25:29| The applicant is Taylor D. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| The location is the south side of Tedford, east of Lakefront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| Approximate size of the tract is 2.02 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Zoning requested is T, transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Existing land use is a garage apartment, landscape contractor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| Staff recommendation is to deny the request for T, transition zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| because the subject site is not consistent with the intent of the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| Before we go forward, Mr. Reynolds, would you like to tell us a little bit about this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| I'll just keep it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Since we went over it on Tuesday, there's really not too much to add at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| As stated, staff is recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| Staff just feels the location is just not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| It's not a transition from a higher intensity use to a lower intensity use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5186)|
| 1:26:36| So if anybody has any questions, feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| I'll do my best to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Sir, do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| I prefer to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Taylor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| Address is 1111 North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5214)|
| 1:27:03| I'm representing the applicant, who the owner of the property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Natural Roots Realty Holding LLC Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| The sole member of that company is Mr. Dan Feehan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| Mr. Dan Feehan owns a landscaping contracting business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| which is through another entity which he is the sole member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| Mr. Feehan purchased or my client purchased this property approximately two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| The property consists of about 2.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| It is a very steeply sloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| Approximately a third of an acre, maybe a little less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| is all that is really viable for the present use and is currently being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| It consists of an A-frame structure that has garage bays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| which are used by my client as kind of more office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| and there's residential up top with full kitchen, full bath, living quarters, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| When my client purchased this property, the previous owner, Mr. Scott Pierce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| who's an engineer, he's the one that carved out the side of the slope and built the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| Mr. Pierce used the property for his machine manufacturing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| and also resided there for a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I've supplemented the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| I had the privilege of speaking with Mr. Pierce earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| and just kind of wanted to get more clarification of his use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| As you can see in that email, he does admit or does offer that he did use the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| for his office and business purposes as well as for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| In regards to staff's rezoning report, contrary to staff's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5325)|
| 1:28:54| I would counter on the following points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| Within the close vicinity of this property, we have one general business use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| Travis Marina is located approximately 700 feet away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| It is zoned CA, general commercial business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| which is the most intensive use under the Knox County Zoning Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| Additionally, we have Hunter Valley Farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| and from the boundary of this property to the boundary of Hunter Valley Farms is less than 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| So Hunter Valley Farms is made up of 36 to 40 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| and recently, as in a few years ago, I believe 2010, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| Hunter Valley Farms, for those familiar with it, operates as an event facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5375)|
| 1:29:41| They host several weddings and different events and parties on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| They have been doing it for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| They received a notice of violation, which brought them to then rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| They rezoned the portion of it to transition that serves the event facility center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| The remainder of it remains agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| That was approved by this commission body as well as the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| Again, that transition zone is obviously very present in the area and in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| Similar to Hunter Valley Farms, although when we applied for the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| we submitted it for the 2.2 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| all we really need and actually prefer is that this envelope, this scope here at the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5423)|
| 1:30:30| be rezoned to transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| And similar, as I submitted the case summaries from Hunter Valley Farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| their transition was limited to a certain envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| and as well was limited to certain conditions and circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| such as an event facility and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Similarly, we would also be willing to restrict our use to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| which would allow the current use to continue to be served, which would be essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| you know, I know commercial and office fall into the same in the county code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| but this is theoretically, it is my client's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| He doesn't sell landscape materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| He doesn't have clients coming to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| He has his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| They come in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| They park and then they leave for the day and then they return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| So there is a necessary base and substantially changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| or changed conditions with the Hunter Valley Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| As far as consistency with the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| the transitional zone allows commercial and non-residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| that are not major traffic generators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Again, this is not a major traffic generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| It is not people coming and going from the site throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| There are minimal trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| The business rarely, rarely works on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| Thanks to the proposal, again, if we're limiting this to the size of the track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| and the scope of what can be used here, again, for an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| contractor's office, similar type intensity use as well as residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| it narrowly limits the scope of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| There's no impact on schools, minimal impact on streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5523)|
| 1:32:11| and it's consistent with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Appreciate your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Ma'am, you're with the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Is there multiple people that would like to speak from the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| or are you the sole representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5543)|
| 1:32:40| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| My name is Patra Bonham, Rule 2825 Keller Bend Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| and I'm here representing Keller Bend Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| and residents of Tedford Road and Tools Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| These folks that are here that were able to take off work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| if they just stand up, please, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| And thank you, Mr. Forrester, for going first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I always appreciate being able to follow the lead here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| I'd like to thank all of you all for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| and the time that you're putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| and I'd also like to thank the professional staff for their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| and due diligence on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| and they've been very helpful in providing the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| and where to click and get all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| I have some prepared statements which I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| The pictures we're sending around are pictures of an average day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| work day, and how many vehicles are on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| which I believe there's at least 10 there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| Many days there are 15 vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| So first I'd like to say I'm going to deviate a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| I'd like to go to this Travis Marine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Travis Marine has been there for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| and I think under any circumstance they would be considered grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Hunter Valley Farm is way more than 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| My driveway is 900 feet, so I have a little bit of a feeling for distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| It's way more than 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| It's actually on the other side of the Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| You have to pass under the parkway to get to Hunter Valley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| And, yes, I'm very aware of Hunter Valley Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| because they were for years in violation of the fire code and all kinds of codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| and those of us in the community were very concerned when proms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| and even county meetings were held there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| and there was no ingress and egress for emergency vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| So we stayed on that for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| And there's a big difference between 2-point-whatever acres and 40 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| because Hunter Valley Farm is really a farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| and it operates in an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| So that's really not a good comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| So getting that out of the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| as we know, Mr. Forster is here representing Natural Roots Realty Holding Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| and they've applied for rezoning from agricultural to transitional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| Our primary concern in our community is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| We've been saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| I've lived there almost 34 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| and some of my members here have lived there 50 years and longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| So safety is we have to drive the road every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| We've got to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| We've got to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| That doesn't mean we're opposed to progress or development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| but I'd like to point out that the professional staff, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| according to Mr. Reynolds here, has recommended denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| and that's because 9222 Tedford Lane is not consistent with the intent of the zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| and it is not compatible with the large residential uses in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| The road width is not appropriate for uses permitted in the transitional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| and there is no public sewer available at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| And you have to think about that because once a property is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| then often for sale signs go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| We all know how that works, so we're not going to pretend that's not an option either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| Our area is under the Southwest Knox County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| Since that plan was developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| nothing in this area has changed to support said request for a spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| what we consider a spot rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| as the sector plan proposes rural residential uses for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| 9222 Tedford Lane is also located within the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| on the Knox County Farragut Growth Plan map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| Additionally, this property, as Mr. Forster even pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| has a very steep slope hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| and it's under the hillside hilltop ridge top protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| This site, in fact, is located next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| and near only to rural agricultural residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| Therefore, there is no transition zone to lesser, higher uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| because it's all agricultural residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| surrounding and extended throughout this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| The previous owner built a garage and garage apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| used it for vehicle storage and perhaps as a man cave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Natural Roots Realty Holding purchased this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| as we know, in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| Ma'am? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| After several months at this location, I can talk faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| You're all right. You've got another minute 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Natural Roots relocated and expanded its business because, bam, wow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| after they'd been there just a very short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| 10 to 15 vehicles, trucks, trailers, dump trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| were parked there on weekdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| and landscaping was undertaken that has detrimentally impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| adjacent and nearby property owners, and this is significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| There's electrical power. There are no sewer lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| The Bedford Lane is narrow, 16 to 18 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| and it is classified, according to our report, as a minor collector road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| only because it connects Keller Bend and Tools Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| All adjacent and area property owners oppose this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| We are asking you to affirm the professional staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| But before I wrap it up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| I want to go to this detrimental nature of the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| because when I talked to the attorney on the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| he was very cordial, and we had a nice conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| and he kept pointing out to me how nice this landscaping was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| This landscaping has caused drainage problems in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| It has rerouted water and flooding the street and nearby property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| So, anyway, again, here we are to ask you to not reward this property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| and follow your staff's professional staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| and recognize that they've actually created a nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| with some of their water damage and to deny this recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| I think staff got this absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| I just look at it, and it doesn't work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| I mean, just because the guy before them was noncompliant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| doesn't mean we need to continue the legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| I'd like to make a motion to deny the request for transition zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| because the subject site is not consistent with the intent of the zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Commissioner Rutan, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Just my quick comment is, for me, this would be a maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| if it was a home occupation where it was a CPA or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| somebody or an architect like a good architect we have on commission here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| Ms. Eason, or something like that, and that would be a maybe for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| That would be a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| Something like this is not where it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| and that would be voting with Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| I see no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| We have a motion on the table to deny staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Next on the agenda is item number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6026)|
| 1:40:46| This is the applicant is Venture Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| The location is the Northside Buttermilk Road, west of Graybiel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| Tract information is 31.8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| The present designation zoning is A, G, Agriculture, A, Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6062)|
| 1:41:11| Proposed designation zoning, LDR, Low Density Residential, PR, Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| Existing land use is Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| Proposed use is Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| The density proposed is three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| Staff recommendation is to adopt Resolution 4E19SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| amending the Northwest County Sector Plan to LDR, Low Density Residential designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| and recommend that County Commission also adopt the Sector Plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| Also to recommend that County Commission approve PR Planned Residential zoning up to 2.1 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6107)|
| 1:41:56| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| I see no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| Sir, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| We would like to go to the three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| and the reason being is even with the three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| we're going to be able to have a four to ten acre green space in the back, a community park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| access for all homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| and this seems to be consistent with the H. Hardin Valley PA Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| and their requests for amenities like this in developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6152)|
| 1:42:41| Commissioner Rutan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| Yeah, I would support his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| I've been around their developments, and they are of the utmost quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| and I would trust that Ms. Frazier or somebody else would have a comment if they didn't feel the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| and so I would make a motion that we approve up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6179)|
| 1:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| And I can go through the rest of it if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| You've got to do it in two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| You've got to do the Sector Plan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| But I would make a motion to approve the Sector Plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the Sector Plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| Ms. Frazier, since there was only a very short amount of time taken, let's hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6212)|
| 1:43:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I just wanted to speak to what Commissioner Uten said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| and this is just another example of how community members can work with developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| and everyone benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| You know, we reached out to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| We've walked the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| We've talked about developments in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| and how we could stay in line with development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| At our request, they have set aside four to ten acres for a park for this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| hopefully taking some cushion off of our county to put us a park in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| but also just to add value to our community, and it's really working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| So I just wanted to speak to that, that it can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| Developers out there, please reach out to community members and neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=6259)|

| 1:56:51| acres. The zoning is PC1, retail and office park. The existing land use is vacant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7011)|
| 1:56:58| the proposed use is retail business and restaurant with drive-thru. The staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| is to approve the request for retail business with approximately 15,000 square feet and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| restaurant with drive-thru with approximately 1,750 square feet as shown on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7031)|

| 1:57:28| you, Commission. My name is Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500. I'm here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| the applicant. With me we have several folks. We have someone down from Duluth Trading from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| Minnesota, Margaret Jordan. We have representatives of the property owner who's going to be providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| a ground lease. Rick and Ryan Chen is here. We have Will Robinson, the civil engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| and representatives of the broker, Will Sims and Chad Turner. So there's a lot of interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| parties in this development. We're here, this has been taken off consent because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7076)|
| 1:58:04| a concern with one of the conditions. Now let me be very clear. We want this to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7084)|
| 1:58:11| today subject to these conditions, but we want some clarification on the condition number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7091)|
| 1:58:18| nine which up until, I believe, Tuesday stated that additional signs may be approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7098)|
| 1:58:25| Planning Commission or proposed signage for the development is subject to approval by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| planning staff and Knoxville Plans Review and Inspection staff. That has now been changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| to approval of the business sign panels on the two development directory signs and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| attached building signs be modified in order to come into compliance with the sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| And so we're seeking some direction and interpretation as to what that means under the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7127)|
| 1:58:54| and I think there may be a difference, respectful difference of opinions on what this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| can do regarding the signage that is present. We are asking that additional signs be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7139)|
| 1:59:08| under section 11.6E5 of the sign ordinance which states that additional signs may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| approved by the Planning Commission as part of the development plan provided that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7154)|
| 1:59:21| scale drawings indicate the signs will not detract from the character of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| or surrounding development and two, that the development plan clearly shows that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| of unusual topography, building locations and relationship to developments with multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| structures, additional signs are essential to inform and direct the public. Now I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7175)|
| 1:59:42| at the Tuesday workshop meeting. At that time I was not representing Duluth. I did listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7182)|
| 1:59:49| to the comments with interest because this seemed unusual to me. I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| topography isn't an issue here and I understand that it is the interpretation of the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| that this section that I just read from does not authorize the commission to increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7200)|
| 2:00:05| total allowable square footage of the signs because there are no topographical concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| with the property. I guess our counter to that interpretation is when you look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| development it is kind of back behind a lot of other developments there at the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| of Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff. There are lots of developments, lots of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7223)|
| 2:00:30| around there with signs and it is frankly very difficult to see back in there from both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff that that is in fact where the development is. So we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7234)|
| 2:00:43| think that in order to inform the public that that is where Duluth is located that additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7243)|
| 2:00:48| signs are needed. Now it does not specifically say that the exception allows for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| square footage but that is a necessary reading of that part of the ordinance because if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| are going to have additional signs either you have to take the signs that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| and keep building them smaller to comply with the square footage or you are allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| additional signs that would overall increase the square footage. It doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| any other way that if you need more signs to inform and direct the public that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| signs have to be smaller. That is completely counter intuitive as to the intent behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| this interpretation and we would say that we would be allowed these additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7281)|
| 2:01:29| to inform and direct the public as to the location. We have tried to work on the signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7289)|
| 2:01:40| to make them smaller and I have some revised sign details if I could and I would ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7300)|
| 2:01:49| additional time because there is a lot to cover here and I have some more things if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| I could pass this up. Since you have no opposition, how much more time? Madam Chair, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7312)|
| 2:02:02| to request at least three more minutes. Thank you, at least. I will try to talk fast. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7322)|
| 2:02:11| will try to talk fast. We have reduced the amount of the square footage that we are requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7331)|
| 2:02:20| to 414 square feet and we probably have a little more wiggle room than that. The additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7340)|
| 2:02:27| sign ordinance allows up to 10% of the wall area of the primary building elevations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| it is interesting that there is a parenthesis S behind there because it does contemplate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| that you can have more than one primary elevation. The address that has been assigned to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| development is a Kingston Pike address. There is no frontage on either Kingston Pike or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| Cedar Bluff but with the Kingston Pike address it stands to reason most people will be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7370)|
| 2:02:57| from Kingston Pike to look for this building and we would say that I think the typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7377)|
| 2:03:05| interpretation is that the location of the main entrance has been the primary elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7385)|
| 2:03:13| I don't think it always has to be that way. I think the location of the side of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| with frontage to the street address that it has been given could also be considered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| primary elevation or could be considered the primary elevation in this case. Again, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| is a zoning interpretation issue. This is a very narrow building and it has done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| intentionally. This business knows how to sell product and part of that is its trademark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| Just like the classic Coke bottle or the Jack Daniels bottle being a square deal, the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7424)|
| 2:03:52| shape and size itself is part of its trademark. It has 90 feet in the front and 170 feet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| the back for that old classic warehouse style. The longer elevation, 170 feet, is what fronts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| on these faces Kingston Pike, the south elevation. If you count that as a primary elevation then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7447)|
| 2:04:15| you have 4,110.54 square feet which would allow 410 square footage of signs. If we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7455)|
| 2:04:26| back out the awning signs which has the men's apparel and the women's apparel, then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7466)|
| 2:04:33| right there at the signage that we would normally request anyway. Keep in mind this is a destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7473)|
| 2:04:39| venue. There is no Duluth trading in Tennessee. There is no Duluth trading anywhere closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7479)|
| 2:04:46| than Louisville, Kentucky. People are going to be coming from outside of Knoxville to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| this location to shop. They're going to be coming to an intersection and to a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| that they're not familiar with. These additional signs and signs that are commensurate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| what else is around there is very important to us. What we would ask is that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| under the authority under the 11.6.E5 do authorize these additional signs to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7507)|
| 2:05:17| us just to have direct and inform the public as to where we are. One more comment and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| almost out of 38 seconds. There was a comment that everybody has GPS and Siri in their pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| and that takes people where they go. To a degree that's true. It's kind of like horseshoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| and hand grenades. It gets you pretty close, but it's not quite close enough. We've all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| had experiences where Siri has told us we're there and we're looking around and can't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| where there is. The signage would say we're there, where is that? You're looking at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| these other signs, the Culvers, the CVS, the Carolina main event. Then you can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| trading company there. It's very reasonable to help people who are coming from out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| town who are going to be looking for this not to create a traffic problem and not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| create a safety problem. Thank you Mr. Mullins. Mr. Breschko, could you give us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| of background and tell us why we're talking about signs instead of land use? Well, under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7570)|
| 2:06:20| the planned district, signage is required to be approved by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| through that review, so that's why you're looking at it with this project. When this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| property originally came in under main event, all the other parcels in this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| had frontage on Kingston Pike or North Cedar Bluff. The main event parcel was set back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| in there, but every entrance into this development was a part of that main event parcel. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| they developed their site plan, they were proposing to cut this parcel out of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| At that time, we told them that how they divide that may impact what would be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| in the approval process. We talked about the access out to Kingston Pike next to CVS between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7620)|
| 2:07:07| CVS and Culver's and the main entrance with a signalized intersection, that if they connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7627)|
| 2:07:13| those out, that would give this parcel frontage on that street. They decided they did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| want to proceed that way and cut this out with no direct access. Its only access is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| through easements on the interior road system. Right around that same time, they got approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7644)|
| 2:07:32| for, under the master sign plan, for a development directory sign. That allowed a sign to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7652)|
| 2:07:39| located on both Kingston Pike and North Cedar Bluff that identified the development at Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| Corner and it identified main event and it had additional panel or panels that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| identify other businesses within the development. It's usually used for businesses that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| have frontage on the main road, that a sign out on Kingston Pike, there's one of the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| there, on Kingston Pike or Cedar Bluff, having a business that's not on that frontage would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| be an off-premise sign. It would not be allowed, but the master sign plan allows that to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| considered. Those were approved, those signs comply with the regulations. In this packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| Duluth Trading Company will be located on both those signs. So, at the two main entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| into the development, they will have Duluth Trading identified at the two signalized intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7708)|
| 2:08:36| Going to that provision about the Planning Commission approved additional signs, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| not fully clear what does that mean. If you approve additional signs, does that mean you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| get more square footage? Our read on that is the additional signs would be cases where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| you're limited to the number of signs. In attached building signs, there's not a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| Your limit is based on your square footage approved for the business. So, if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| 400 square feet of signage, you can place that 400 anywhere on that building that meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| the requirements of placement on the building. You can have it on all four sides. But that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| is based on your frontage. My understanding is, you know, and part of the reason why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7754)|
| 2:09:22| changed our condition, it was usually because we don't have all the sign details worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| out when it goes through the Planning Commission. We put a condition saying it's subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| staff and codes enforcement approval of the signage. That's the language we put in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7771)|
| 2:09:38| the applicant had a sign proposal that exceeded the overall square footage. So we needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7778)|
| 2:09:46| address that and that's why we changed it. But the provision about the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| approving more signage, it is our read on that, that it would not apply to providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7791)|
| 2:09:57| additional square footage on a building when you're not limited to the number of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| One of the key issues here, I think, at least in our looking at that, the first part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| that provision talks kind of about scale and there may not be an issue with the scale of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| the signs to the building because if it's approval on one face it may look the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| fine on the other too. But it's the issue about the signage being needed to help direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7817)|
| 2:10:26| people to a business that you wouldn't otherwise know that's there. Because the two main entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| in the development have, the signalized intersections will have Duluth Trading on that sign, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7832)|
| 2:10:39| being notified or have identification that that business is in this development. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| turn onto those streets, you go straight back on each one and you go back off the Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| Pike, you go back directly, you'll see Main Event there and they're going to be right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| in front of Main Event. So you will see the building, you'll see a sign that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| on the side. If you go in the signalized intersection on Cedar Bluff, as you drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| back on that, Main Event's directly ahead, you look a little bit to the right, you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7865)|
| 2:11:09| see Duluth Trading. If you go in the one by CVS, you go in, it's almost directly ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7869)|
| 2:11:14| or you look a little bit to the left, you'll see it. So our feeling is there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7874)|
| 2:11:18| in topography, there's nothing in buildings blocking the view, you will be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| the building once you enter the development and you'll be able to see the signs. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| not, again, opposed to the signs that they're proposing here, it's just that the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| interpretation is made on attached signs, it's on your primary entrance, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| they had met with codes concerning how they would apply that and since their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| is the narrowest portion of the building, that restricts what they can have on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| building, anywhere on that building. They have a different design that has more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| barn type higher elevation. If they use that, that increases the amount of square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| they could have. It's my understanding, under development restriction for that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7920)|
| 2:12:07| that there's a height issue in using that, it's not a zoning issue, it's not an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| that we have, it's something that the developer restriction they have and I'm not sure, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| may be able to answer, but that may be for the purpose of not putting a building that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| blocks main event. It may have been a restriction put on that parcel when main event purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| the property and decided to build there. They can move, again, they can move their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| to the longer facade, would give them 400 square feet. I looked online just to see other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7951)|
| 2:12:39| building designs, there's kind of two main ones they use, but I've seen designs where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| they had a corner entrance, so they had frontage on both sides, that may be where the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| can interpret that plural version of frontage, if they had two main entrances at the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7971)|
| 2:12:59| they get both, they would have to make that call, but I think they have some options and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| that's basically what our condition refers to, is submitting a plan that meets the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7985)|
| 2:13:12| requirement as far as having the area that would allow them to do the sign package, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| something close to it. Thank you, that was a very clear explanation, thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=7997)|
| 2:13:25| Roth. Thank you Madam Chair. Let me first say I think this development coming here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8005)|
| 2:13:31| Knoxville is a big deal, I think it's a company that is recognized nationwide and to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8011)|
| 2:13:36| the only one in Tennessee and Knoxville is important, and the tax revenue, not to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| the tax revenue that would come here to the city, if they come here. And I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8020)|
| 2:13:48| this particular setup is not unattractive, and I voted against the sign ordinance when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8028)|
| 2:13:57| we had it here, because I don't like ordinances that tie our hands, where we can't allow things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8037)|
| 2:14:04| that sometimes they may not make sense in some places, but they make sense in others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| and I think this makes sense here. So I want to ask Director Green, he and I had spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8048)|
| 2:14:13| just a little bit ago, to talk about our avenue of allowing the signage, and what their options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8053)|
| 2:14:23| are there, and what we can do. I also think that what they proposed with this new one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8063)|
| 2:14:29| they're trying to get to where we are, and it may make some sense. So if you'd just talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| about that a little bit, I'd appreciate it. I may have a couple more comments. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| and I'll try to explain the options. I think Tom Bretschko provided some options that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8077)|
| 2:14:45| developer could look at, in terms of what the planning commission could do. The ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8085)|
| 2:14:53| is somewhat unclear, I think. Mr. Mullins made a good argument for signs include, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8093)|
| 2:15:01| include sign size. Our interpretation of signs is the number of signs. That's a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| this commission has to make. You can't, Mr. Mullins alluded to, well maybe the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8106)|
| 2:15:13| facade is the side without the entrance. That's a zoning, or plans review, zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| interpretation. We can't change that. The only avenue for changing that interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| is through the Board of Zoning Appeals, so we can't use that as a basis. You can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| a different interpretation of the plan development standard with regard to signs, that that includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| sign size, and look for some compromise within that. I would ask Mr. Mullins, as a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| trying to reduce the overall scope of signs, are the blade signs required, given that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| got this huge sign that says Duluth Trading Company, do you need a smaller one that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| a wall sign that says Duluth Trading Company, do you need a blade sign that says Duluth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| Trading Company? Trying to, I think, reaching a compromise, attempts to meet the spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| of the sign code while addressing the concerns of the business is important. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8166)|
| 2:16:13| some compromise, and just raise that as a potential other one, would that be one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| would work? And that's what we're trying to do. Our first sign proposal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8178)|
| 2:16:24| the sign over the front door had that brown brick around it, and that was counted as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8184)|
| 2:16:32| of the sign face. And just to kind of frame the issue we have with the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| how it applies to this particular business, this particular piece of property, if our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| primary elevation is the front entrance, or if we're limited to the square footage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| that front entrance, then that sign over the door may not even be allowed by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8208)|
| 2:16:56| So that is a huge deal, because our building is so narrow, 90 feet wide. So if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8216)|
| 2:17:05| to go to the BZA for interpretation as what the primary elevation, that is not defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| in the ordinance anywhere, what primary elevation is. And, you know, I've been working in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| area law for 19 years, I have a stack of case law that says zoning ordinances are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| derogation of the common law, and they inert to the benefit of the free use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| owner's land. So if there's an interpretation issue, if there's an ambiguity, it's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| to go to the benefit of the property owner. And that's what the case law says over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| over and over again. If that is not within this commission's purview to make that interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| then we still have the issue of can we allow additional signs, and what does that mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8260)|
| 2:17:46| And, again, I would say that's what I asked, that's what I stated, what I asked you was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| would the blade signs, is that a room for compromise? If we're stuck to the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8271)|
| 2:18:00| elevation with the revised signs, and again, I know, I know, I'm going to, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| interrupt. If we're trying to find room for compromise, are the blade signs just enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8285)|
| 2:18:12| The way we've put this out with our revised signs package we passed around, the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| sign is now 136.69, and each side elevation sign is 100.22. That is 236. That might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8297)|
| 2:18:26| close. What are we, I thought it was 242 is what you're saying we're limited to. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| from the, again, yeah, I just did some rough calculations when I did, but I think the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| in the front, because the part where the Duluth sign is on the front, that can go up, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| sign can be placed on there, but I believe when they look at the square footage, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| the roof line, not the parapet wall going up. But if you did it with that, it was, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| think, like 203 square feet. Yeah, with the, I guess one of the things that, looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8332)|
| 2:19:00| this, the proposed sign package, like I said, if you're looking at can you approve additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8340)|
| 2:19:07| signs that would still be close to the square footage, the main entrance sign as you proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| it, the one that's on the Kingston Pike side, the same size, you're talking again 236 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8354)|
| 2:19:22| feet or so, the one that's facing main event, that basically just faces the main event building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8362)|
| 2:19:29| when you're coming down the roads from the Cedar Bluff side, I'm not sure what benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| that gives, it's additional signage, but it doesn't necessarily help identify the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| If we're looking at stuff that helps direct the public, and when you have the sign on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| the front and the side, do the blade signs, I mean, what does that add? It may be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8382)|
| 2:19:49| they use in their design, but is it needed to identify, here's Duluth? Yeah. And I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| our concern is if the parapet isn't counted, which I believe we were counting the parapet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| in our calculations, we wouldn't even have room for anything but the front sign over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| the door, because that would be 236. Based on that front, if you don't count the parapet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8404)|
| 2:20:11| extension above the roof line, I think it was approximately 203 square feet. Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| And your sign on the front is 136, so it falls within that. That's right, the front sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8416)|
| 2:20:23| does with the side elevation sign is 100.22, so that would be 236, which would be out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| compliance with the zoning ordinance, so we couldn't have the side sign unless we counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| the parapet as part of the primary elevation. And I guess, and this may be just something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| that the Planning Commission can look at, if there's an interpretation that additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| signs, if that allows you to approve two, three, or four on this building, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8444)|
| 2:20:51| in a sense put you above the square footage, what is needed to identify the business so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| people can see it coming, driving by, coming down the roads, and having the two signs as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8457)|
| 2:21:04| you propose, although it exceeds by 30-some square feet, if the Planning Commission feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8464)|
| 2:21:11| that's acceptable, then it may be something, if you all feel you can approve, you can approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| that, but having signs that aren't any additional benefit except putting more sign out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8477)|
| 2:21:25| is that appropriate? And I guess that's part of the question. I'm sorry, go ahead ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8485)|
| 2:21:32| I know that there's some other commissioners that also have some questions. I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| make a couple of comments in relation. Right, I see your light's still on, so you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| off the table yet. So, Commissioner Roth, go ahead with your other thoughts. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8503)|
| 2:21:52| Madam Chair. One of the other things I want to point out is I think these companies that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| are in the retail business that know what they sell and how they sell are probably better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| suited to tell us what they need for their business than we are to tell them what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| need for their business. I think they're making some headway. Did we get an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8527)|
| 2:22:15| though if the blade signs are really required, do you really need those? At a minimum, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| would need the front sign and the south sign elevation. That is not what they want, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8541)|
| 2:22:30| at a minimum, the blade signs help, but you have to have a sign that's facing Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8550)|
| 2:22:37| Pike and you have to have a sign that's facing Cedar Bluff. I think what the commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8557)|
| 2:22:44| trying to do is provide reasonable signage, but also base that decision on compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8564)|
| 2:22:52| with what the regulation states so that there are grounds for approving that signage. Darryl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8572)|
| 2:22:59| I think when we have a regulation that says we can approve more signage, does it say more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8579)|
| 2:23:05| signage or more signs? More signs. I think that gives us a big leeway where we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8585)|
| 2:23:14| say they can put ten more signs on that building if they want to or we can give them some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| square footage. And that's your call. Did you have anything else to add? No, I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8598)|
| 2:23:27| Personally, I just want to say I really like the idea of a building that's a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8607)|
| 2:23:35| different than other big businesses coming to Knoxville, and it is exciting, but we in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| Knoxville have decided how we want to be, how we want to look, and that's part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| ordinances, and for us to say that we will bend over and not observe our ordinances or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8625)|
| 2:23:52| disregard our ordinances in order to get a business who says that they know better how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| to market, I've got a problem with that, but that's just that. So, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8636)|
| 2:24:04| I have a couple of things. As far as the signage goes and the square footage, Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8644)|
| 2:24:13| you say you've got it counted in and it's close. I don't like the extended parapet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| I think the people of West Knoxville have spoken when they say the lower the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| the better. We made Chewy's take theirs from a 40-foot sign down to a pediment sign, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8662)|
| 2:24:29| it works great. It looks great. Everybody was happy. This maybe not so much, but are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| we including the awnings as signs? Is that included in your signage? In our original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8674)|
| 2:24:41| sign package, yes, there was the sign over the front entrance, the two side signs, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| two blade signs, and yes, the awning signs, the men's gear, is part of that. I don't consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| those two awnings as part of the signing package. I mean, that's an awning. You can decorate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| it however you want, in my opinion. That's just my opinion. Again, in addition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| I think this development, through no fault of your own, I think it is confusing. I come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| into this development a lot off of Cedar Bluff. Even though you'd think it'd be very simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8710)|
| 2:25:18| I wish I had a nickel for every time I got out of my truck and started walking into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8718)|
| 2:25:25| fast food restaurant that wasn't Carolina Ale House. Usually my truck goes straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8725)|
| 2:25:31| to any place that has beer, but it's confusing. I mean, you get in there and they're all turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| different ways, so I think there is a little bit of topography that is confusing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| I support what Commissioner Roth says. I think having Duluth Trading Company here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| is exciting. I don't think we ought to throw out our sign ordinances, and I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| to approve anything that puts us contrary to the codes administration, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| that the signs that I see on this building and this sign package, and I think you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| getting ready to hear from another commissioner, I think the blade signs are cool, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| that the way they've done their signage doesn't look bad. I think it looks good, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| it's a good idea in that location to try and help the businesses with signage as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| we can without putting us in conflict with the codes administration people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| Thank you. Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. You know, three things. Number one, everything they've proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8789)|
| 2:26:36| here does not seem egregious to me at all. I mean, I understand we've got codes and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8796)|
| 2:26:42| got regulations, but gosh, I agree with Commissioner Roth and Commissioner Clancy. I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8802)|
| 2:26:50| go into that place, and I certainly have been to Main Event a number of times with my children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| and I still get confused sometimes driving through there, even with that big Main Event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| sign. You know, Duluth is going to be an awesome asset to Knoxville for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8821)|
| 2:27:13| and number three, I just hate to cut our nose off to spite our face here. I mean, what if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| we do really put some kind of regulation on a sign that would keep Duluth from coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| here that's not just, you know, egregious? I know that's my personal opinion, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8845)|
| 2:27:33| my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8853)|
| 2:27:34| I think that's oftentimes what we give is our opinions on the issues. Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| you've had your light on for a long time. Did you get tired of waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| Yeah, I did kind of, but that's okay. I was just going to say that I don't find the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| is objectionable at all. I think the building looks nice. I understand the need for signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| on all sides of the building. I was curious about the size of the main sign here in comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8875)|
| 2:28:02| to the Main Event. Do you know if their signs are comparable in size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| Because the front of the Main Event is wider, their signs are larger. I believe the Main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8887)|
| 2:28:17| Event has a total of 795 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| Yeah, so they're a bigger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| Bigger signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| I don't know. To me, I don't think we need to tell this company what building to place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| here. I think they're probably good at that, and nothing that they're presenting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| in my opinion, is objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8917)|
| 2:28:38| Thank you, Madam Chair. A couple of things here. One is, in my interpretation, I'm taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8918)|
| 2:28:45| additional as both of those items. It can be more signs or additional square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8925)|
| 2:28:54| and maybe when the City Council committed to addressing the sign ordinance one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8934)|
| 2:29:00| after its adoption, that we can clean up some of these items, but until then, maybe they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| should say increase in number of signs would make it much more clear if they meant it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| be an increase in number of signs. I do have a question about the north-facing sign. Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8951)|
| 2:29:19| you find that absolutely vital to this sign package? Because it seems a little bit, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8959)|
| 2:29:27| would say, unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| I know my clients think that since it fronts north Cedar Bluff towards the interstate where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8969)|
| 2:29:35| people will be coming, that they certainly would like to have at least one sign visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8975)|
| 2:29:41| in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| I would also like to hear from Peter Ahrens, because I think it's important to know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| the building official says about this, and if they have any participation, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| I guess it could come to them? I think Peter's in the building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| And then, as far as the, I know that you can't exceed the main parapet, so if we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9004)|
| 2:30:12| this, are we now allowing them to exceed the primary parapet of the building? And I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9012)|
| 2:30:18| some clarification from our, I guess, MPC staff here, because I know ordinarily that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9018)|
| 2:30:24| not allowed. They could lower the blade sign or the projection sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| Good afternoon, Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9030)|
| 2:30:34| definitely have looked at this, looked for opportunities to work with the customer, Duluth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| Trading Post. Recognize that there's multiple wheels in motion here, whether it be the master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| sign plan, which out of Section 9, specifically, addresses the construction of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9046)|
| 2:30:54| specifically addresses project directional signs and development directory signs, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9054)|
| 2:31:01| then we look in Section 11, where it talks about commercial and industrial zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| with exceptions. And one of those exceptions, as was described, is if the applicant comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| to you, they can pursue additional signs. I would agree with Mr. Hill, that if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9074)|
| 2:31:22| have one sign that is, that meets their maximum allowable signage, then you would have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9082)|
| 2:31:30| opportunity, they would have the opportunity to seek additional signs, which would automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| put them over the maximum allowable signage. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| Okay. So our position, from my department, from the City, is that they have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9101)|
| 2:31:46| to come and seek those additional signs, signage, but beyond that, it's your call whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9106)|
| 2:31:53| you think it's appropriate, based on the location and the building siting and topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9113)|
| 2:32:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Thank you. Commissioner Eason, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9124)|
| 2:32:10| I think Peter just cleared my question. I think the biggest concern for me is figuring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| out whether or not we have the authority to actually allow additional signage, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9133)|
| 2:32:18| appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| Great. Commissioner Eaton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| Yeah, I was the same place with Commissioner Hill. I still am having a little bit of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9140)|
| 2:32:29| issue. If I'm going to try to do more signage and more square footage for the Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9149)|
| 2:32:36| facing signs with the blade and the south facing sign to Kingston Pike, as far as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| can see, as far back as that sign is on the north elevation, back behind where Main Events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| Building is, that one to me is, you know, you don't get one unless you ask, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9168)|
| 2:32:57| certainly at the same location as the other one. I'm all for giving more square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9177)|
| 2:33:01| on this building. I'm with the other commissioners that have spoke positively about this. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9181)|
| 2:33:08| on that signed task force as a proxy from one of those commissioners that were on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| or people that were appointed on there. I'm not going to say I lost two years of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| but it was a long go. Don Parnell was on that board, former executive at MPC, and his big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| fear was there were obviously going to be some unintended consequences to that code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9207)|
| 2:33:39| because you couldn't solve for everything, and I think this is one of those things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| there's just an unintended consequence. So I would be certainly for more square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| and more signage. I'm just a little bit on the fence about the north one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| Thank you. Commissioner Glancy. Okay, Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9234)|
| 2:33:59| The reason why I'm in favor of the, what do you call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| Blade sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9243)|
| 2:34:04| Blade sign is because I live that way. I shop in that area, and when you look at that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9244)|
| 2:34:13| the way it's proposed in this blade sign, it just looks like the trademark or brand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| of this company. It gives you the feel of who they are. It's just not another sign on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9258)|
| 2:34:23| the front of a building. It just, whether you're looking at it from a consumer perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| or from a developer's perspective, it's a really cool sign. It reminds me of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| Theater sign. It just, it looks quaint. It just adds some character. It's not just another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9274)|
| 2:34:41| building with another sign on the front. It's adorable, and maybe that's not how you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| would describe it. It's very cool. It's just cool. It's not ordinary, and I like things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9286)|
| 2:34:53| that are appealing in Knoxville. I like when developers and builders or brands have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| a little out of the ordinary, and this looks cool, and that's very appealing as a shopper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9299)|
| 2:35:05| and as someone who's trying to just think about enriching Knoxville and not just having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| cookie cutter things. The Tennessee Theater is beautiful. The big sign out front, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| not sure it would go under our code today, our sign code, because they've got the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| on the front. They've got it coming down this ginormous sign. We just paid a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| lot of money, not we, but to have that entirely redone, it's ginormous, and this is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9324)|
| 2:35:31| small piece of their brand is the way I look at it, so I would be in favor of the blade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9331)|
| 2:35:37| I'd like to say something real quick. I was going to say I'm going to put Mr. Green in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9337)|
| 2:35:44| front of everybody else that had their lights on. I like blade signs, too. I was just looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| for some compromise, trying to reach a point where the planning commission would feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| in approving the sign package. I don't want anyone to think I don't like blade signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9353)|
| 2:35:59| I think they're pretty cool, too. I certainly think you don't. I was under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9359)|
| 2:36:05| you didn't, but now I'm glad. I'm glad I've cleared my record. Commissioner Smith. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9365)|
| 2:36:12| I was just going to say that the north-facing sign Chris was asking about, it does make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9372)|
| 2:36:17| sense to me because of the interstate. I mean, that would be a very visible area, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9377)|
| 2:36:22| it might be, I think it's at the back of the building now, it might be better to move it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9382)|
| 2:36:26| if they thought about it, to the front, be a little more visible from the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| but I think, you know, there's a lot of people that would get their location of that business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| as they drive down the interstate, so I think it does make sense there. Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9396)|
| 2:36:43| Yes. I'd like to make a motion. I'd like to make a motion that we approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| for the retail business with approximately 15,000 square feet and restaurant with drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| with approximately 1,750 square feet as shown on the development plan, subject to the ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| conditions with condition number nine being that the signage package is dictated by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9420)|
| 2:37:08| facility solutions group that was turned into us just now, that that is the signage package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| that we go with. Second. I don't want to give anybody carte blanche and I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9433)|
| 2:37:20| put the staff on the spot or leave it as much in their purview, but I think what they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| turned in with this design package is a good compromise and I think it looks good and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9446)|
| 2:37:32| why I included that. We had a motion by Commissioner Clancy and Commissioner Hill, was that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9452)|
| 2:37:40| that seconded? Okay, seconded by Commissioner Hill to approve the request with the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| number nine being the sign package as submitted by facility solutions group. I do not see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9466)|
| 2:37:54| any other lights on. All in favor say aye. Aye. Is there any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9474)|
| 2:38:02| Thank you very much. Thank you all. Next on the agenda is item number 49. I believe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9482)|
| 2:38:12| have some members of the audience that sat through a long meeting to get to this. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| you all. Let me get to the start of it. Okay, agenda 49 is a use on review. The applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9498)|
| 2:38:39| is Calvary Chapel of Knoxville. Location is south of West Governor John Severe Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9519)|
| 2:38:47| east of Alcoa Highway. Approximate size of the tract is 42.7 acres. Zoning is RP1 planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9527)|
| 2:38:56| residential. Existing land use is a church. The proposed use is a parking lot, playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9536)|
| 2:39:04| assembly areas, prayer garden and multi-use green space. Staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9544)|
| 2:39:11| the proposed site improvements for Calvary Chapel of Knoxville as identified on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| plan subject to four conditions. Is the applicant present? Yes. And is there opposition? Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9557)|
| 2:39:30| which would you like to go first? Briefly, I'll go first. I'm David Harbin at 4334 Papermill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9570)|
| 2:39:37| Drive here in Knoxville, surveyor engineer for this project and here on behalf of Calvary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9577)|
| 2:39:42| Chapel. Mark Kirk, the pastor of that chapel will be up here later on too. As you identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9582)|
| 2:39:50| that the church is being very successful, it's growing so that needs for the new use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9590)|
| 2:39:55| on review. Use on review was approved probably about 10-15 years ago. However, now we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| ready for a parking lot expansion, a prayer garden and an activities field and a children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| play area. They have quite a bit of property here. It's in 42 acres. You probably can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9606)|
| 2:40:12| see it from any of the outside areas what they're doing. So with that, we're in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9612)|
| 2:40:17| with the staff and Mr. Clancy, I would urge you or another person up there to move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9617)|
| 2:40:24| approve this plan. Stay in your lane, bro. Okay, so you have reserved some time. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9624)|
| 2:40:36| opposition? I'm Mary Miller, 3918 Shipwatch Lane and we live off of Topside Road. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9636)|
| 2:40:45| say we're not really opposed to this request. We just want to make sure that there are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| things that are not included in the request and confirm. One, we want to make sure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9651)|
| 2:40:58| Mr. Regco's assured us that there's no request to include road access or driveway access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9658)|
| 2:41:03| from the church to Topside Road. That road can just not handle, we had this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| for many of the members last year or 2017, that road can just not handle any more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9670)|
| 2:41:19| Secondly, when this was approved in 2004, there was concern about, there's about 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9679)|
| 2:41:27| neighbors who live right behind this parcel and there was concern about lighting and noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9687)|
| 2:41:40| And so we, and at that time, the request provided that there was no, there would be no lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9700)|
| 2:41:48| and that there would be no night time activities. The big concern that those neighbors have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| and I have to be frank with you, that part doesn't impact us because we live down, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9713)|
| 2:42:00| live on the other side of Topside. But several of the neighbors do have, the ones who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| right behind it have this concern about, they wouldn't like, they don't want softball fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| and softball games going on at night because of the noise and the chance for lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| So we would like to be assured that there's no lighting allowed. And then the last thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| is there's, the last time there was, when they applied in 2017, there was definiteness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9741)|
| 2:42:28| to the description of the green space and here there's not, it is, it's not described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9748)|
| 2:42:35| what they're doing with the green space truly and there's no boundaries to it on the plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9755)|
| 2:42:43| that they're showing really. And so we would just like a little more specificity of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9763)|
| 2:42:49| they're doing with the green space. And that's, otherwise we have no objections and, to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9769)|
| 2:42:58| proposal. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| Hi, my name is Mark Kirk and I'm the pastor of Calvary Chapel and it's a blessing to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9782)|
| 2:43:09| to share our heart with you guys. That is our heart, we want to be a blessing to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9789)|
| 2:43:13| neighbors, we want to be a blessing to Knoxville, that's why we came. We're here just to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| and that's our heart and, but we don't believe that not developing our property is in conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9798)|
| 2:43:24| with blessing our neighbors or blessing Knoxville, that's why we bought it. And as far as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9804)|
| 2:43:31| goes on the land, there are no plans for anything as far as the green areas, what we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| to do is be able to throw frisbees and let the kids throw a football and have a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| for church picnics and those kind of activities. And so it's just a green area, just so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| have 43 acres, well 42 now, part of it was taken with the project that was there before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9824)|
| 2:43:49| and we just wanted to be able to use more of the property for our people, we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| to be kind of a place of refuge, a place you can get away and pray and walk and enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| We have no plans for any ball fields or anything like that, just green areas to play on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9837)|
| 2:44:02| to bless our people and if our neighbors want to come and be blessed, they're more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| welcome. So that's our heart and I don't know what else to say unless you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| Thank you, stand by because I see a couple of lights on, there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Yeah, in response to Ms. Miller, I went out there last night and the reason I went on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9857)|
| 2:44:26| Wednesday night, I figured there'd be a church service going on, waited until it was dark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9866)|
| 2:44:33| and drove back in, there's a long driveway, it's got to be a quarter of a mile or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9873)|
| 2:44:41| back into the property. I couldn't see, take that back, what I was looking for were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9881)|
| 2:44:52| houses that backed up to the church. I went through there during the day and couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9892)|
| 2:44:59| see a thing, lights from the existing houses. To say that I could see lights is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9899)|
| 2:45:08| a stretch. You see a little flash here where there might be a light and another one down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9908)|
| 2:45:15| a little further and another one, but you couldn't even see the houses. There were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9915)|
| 2:45:24| their parking lot was lit up, so I thought, well, I'll go up on Topside Road and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| back and see how offensive that is. I couldn't see it. It's over the hill and down. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9930)|
| 2:45:40| think that, I guess where the parking lot is going is where it's cleared out now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9940)|
| 2:45:47| it's been leveled off. It seemed like the only place for a parking lot. The rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| the 43 acres is rough. It's steep and it's wooded and it's not anything where you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9953)|
| 2:46:02| going to go and run around. I just think if we follow what the staff has laid out, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9962)|
| 2:46:12| there's no access to Topside Road, they're not going to disturb anybody on Topside Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9972)|
| 2:46:22| by their submission. Mr. Clancy. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. I think I agree with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9982)|
| 2:46:32| that Commissioner Graf said. I went and looked at it. I do think it's reasonable that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=9992)|
| 2:46:42| add a condition that restricts all access to John Sevier Highway and no access from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10002)|
| 2:46:51| Topside. I think that would be a really good condition to add to this. I'm going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10011)|
| 2:46:56| a motion to that effect, but I would ask Mr. Kirk that he please not bless his neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10016)|
| 2:47:02| with baseball lights and baseball fields. I think that's a good concern of theirs, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10022)|
| 2:47:08| if he says he won't, I think he won't. So I would like to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10028)|
| 2:47:13| the proposed site improvements for Calvary Chapel of Knoxville as identified on the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| plan subject to five conditions, adding condition number five, which makes all access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10038)|
| 2:47:27| church from John Sevier, to Governor John Sevier Highway and restricts any access from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| Topside Road. Second. We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and I believe it was second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10052)|
| 2:47:41| by Commissioner Graf. Is that correct? Okay. Mr. Harbin, you still do have a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10061)|
| 2:47:47| of time. An issue for us, you know, we can't build any access roads to Topside Road unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10067)|
| 2:47:54| we come back before this body and ask for that to happen, so I don't know if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10074)|
| 2:48:00| really a need to put a condition on there that we won't do it. We'd prefer not to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| that condition, but for us to do anything, we'd have to come back here in five, ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| fifteen years or whatever, somebody else would have to come back to do that. So I don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| see a need to say there's no access there, since we couldn't build it anyway without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10095)|
| 2:48:20| a plan or approval through this body. Thank you. Mr. Smith? That's what I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10100)|
| 2:48:25| say, although it's not the end of the world one way or the other, but to put a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10105)|
| 2:48:31| like that in place, I guess that would be a permanent, ongoing thing forever. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10111)|
| 2:48:37| if they ever wanted to access, they'd have to come back and resubmit anyway, right? It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10117)|
| 2:48:42| almost like, I guess, a safety net in that the plans approved do not show access to Topside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10122)|
| 2:48:49| and that's what you're approving, so that condition would be a safety net. They would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10129)|
| 2:48:55| have to come back with amended plans to have access onto Topside. If that condition were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| approved, they would have to come back and get approval for access onto Topside. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10140)|
| 2:49:07| if it doesn't hurt one way or the other, I mean, Mr. Harvin, do you want to just throw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| me a bone? Could I share just briefly on that? The reason that we did want to keep the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10152)|
| 2:49:19| of the future of that... There still is. Yeah, and certainly we're not pursuing that now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| but when we came before this body 15 years ago, we actually did it before we purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10163)|
| 2:49:28| the property, because we wanted two accesses, and so we didn't want to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| We thought that would be non-prudent, and so we said, let's go before the NPC first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10172)|
| 2:49:37| to see if they'll give us two accesses. Then if they approve that, we'll move forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| buy the property. So after we got approval from this body to have two accesses, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190411?start=10181)|
