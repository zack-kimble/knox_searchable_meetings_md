| 0:02:11| The motion is properly before us to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=134)|

| 0:02:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Mr. Law Director, would you swear in the individuals that are to appear before us and testify today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| If you're here today to appear and testify before this, the Knox County Bureau Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| will you please stand at this time and raise your right hand to be sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you shall give in this matter be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| The first item that we have before us, Madam Clerk, would you read, please, the 5A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Discussion and possible action against beer permittees that are delinquent in paying their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| annual beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| Herman Walker, Jr., Mr. DeWitt, All Market and Deli, 7201 Chapman Highway, Off Premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| Madam Clerk, would you give the body the facts of this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| The Mr. DeWitt, All Beer Permit was issued in December of 2014, and we send out a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| for the beer privilege tax each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| They were sent out on December 1, 2015, which were due no later than January 31, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=216)|
| 0:03:48| It was not paid by Mr. DeWitt, All Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| A certified letter was then mailed on 2-3-16, and the return receipt was received in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| The tax was then paid on February 17, and the check was returned on February 26, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| I have called several times, left many messages with no response from Mr. Walker, and Captain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=248)|
| 0:04:17| May has also been to the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Captain Mays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| I've been out there at least 10 times during different times of the day, have talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| some of the businesses next door, and their door is padlocked, no signs of anyone being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| I did, in January, get a quarter-push illegal gambling machine out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=279)|
| 0:04:50| This January, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Because that's the one next door to Bayou Bay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| I haven't seen anybody in that building for close to a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| They were there just a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| I've been watching it lately, but I know there hadn't been, probably when you got that machine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| they locked it up for good, because, I don't know, I'd make a motion we pull the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| A motion is before us, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| Seeing none, I thought this may have some discussion in that this is the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| that this has occurred, but Knox County needs to know that if you don't comply with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| beer board, your license is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| So the motion is properly before us to, as Commissioner Brown said, to pull the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| No second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| No, it's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Mr. Law Director, we have further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Is the motion to revoke or to void?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| To me, that's the same, but I guess legally it should be no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=357)|
| 0:06:11| There's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| You can void this license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| If you revoke the license, then this premises loses the right for a year to have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| If you void the license, then it doesn't stay with the property, but I just want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| clarity on your motion to void?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| The motion is to void the license, which means the business operator is the one losing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| license, not the premises or premises owner ability to have someone lease the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| and apply within the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| That piece of property has got some bad juju.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Nobody has been able to make it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| I mean, nobody stays over three or four months, do they, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| The motion properly seconded before us is to void the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Madam Clerk, the next application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Application, Jiang Chen, Chefs Asian Cuisine, 10612 Hardin Valley Road, Suite 110, On-Premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| 1066.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=443)|
| 0:07:24| Mr. Law Director, is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| Give your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Hey, are you anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| My name's Jiang Chen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| It's the Chefs Asian Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Mr. Law Director, this may be nitpicking, but he stood on the swearing in, but he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| not raise his hand or he did not say, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| So, as far as I'm concerned, if he's going to testify, he needs to be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Both individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Mr. Cheng, who is with you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Chefs Asian Cuisine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| And you are here for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| For the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Translator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| I'll need to speak to her first, Mr. Cheng.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=490)|

| 0:08:12| I need your name and address for the record, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| My name is Carol O, and the address is for the restaurant, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| Yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=504)|

| 0:08:26| 7349 Carol Wynn's Land, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| We're going to do this in two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| I have to swear you in as a translator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Once I do that, then you're going to talk to Mr. Cheng, and we're going to swear him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| in again so he understands what's going on, okay, because he may not have gotten it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| So I'm going to start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| And you're a translator for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| What language will you be translating in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Mandarin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Mandarin Chinese?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Now, I'm going to swear you in at this time, so please raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| Do you solemnly swear and affirm that you will translate from English to Mandarin Chinese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| and from Mandarin Chinese to English honestly and correctly, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| You're sworn in now to translate for Mr. Cheng.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=559)|

| 0:09:36| Ask him to raise his right hand, and you do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=580)|

| 0:10:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Now, I want you to tell him that he's under oath now, and that everything that he says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| must be truthful, or it can be held as perjury, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=618)|

| 0:11:18| Has he or any of his employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=678)|
| 0:11:34| against possession, sale, manufacturer, or transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=694)|
| 0:12:05| Of any intoxicating liquors or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=725)|

| 0:14:38| Yes. Yes. Okay. Now I'm going to ask the staff some questions at this time. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=878)|
| 0:14:54| Health Department? Fire Marshal? Codes? Sheriff Department? Mr. Chairman? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=894)|
| 0:15:06| you. Mr. Law Director? They still have to have a business tax and still need a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=906)|
| 0:15:22| of registration. Commissioner Anderson? I'd like to make the motion to approve pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| the, you need to turn in your business license and your registration, your LLC, to the clerk's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=929)|

| 0:16:31| Chuck Ward, 8715 Martinville Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920. Mr. Law Director? Mr. Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=991)|
| 0:16:41| I think you had an opportunity to hear the questions that I'm going to ask. I did. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| pretty good detail, so we're going to go through them. Is he here to translate? A little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| fast. This is my translator. Yes, sir. Thank you for asking. Coming across the river there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| you got to translate for him. You didn't have to say that. All right. Are you a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| of the state of Tennessee? I am. Okay. Is the information on your application current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1019)|

| 0:17:32| at this location before? Not under our establishment. Okay. So there's no outstanding license. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| this is for on premises? Yes, sir. Okay. Do you own the premises or rent? No, sir. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| lease it. Lease it. Okay. Is anyone in business with you or are you the sole owner? Just myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| and Mr. Copeland here. Okay. It's an LLC. Okay. Mr. Copeland. And who will be operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| this business? Both myself and Mr. Copeland. Okay. Are you familiar with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| and Tennessee Beer Laws and Regulations and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1085)|

| 0:18:17| at this time received your server training program? Yes, sir. We've both been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| the training program and we will only hire people that have. Okay. I'm going to ask staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| some questions now. Okay. Health Department? Fire Marshal? Okay. Did you get that? Certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1109)|
| 0:18:44| of Occupancy. He couldn't hear you. Okay. Coach? He needs to apply for a permit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| the assembly occupancy in the Harley shop because it changed from Mercantile from 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| And because of that, there's a Tennessee law, the Tennessee architect and engineer's law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| that require any assembly occupancy to have a licensed architect or engineer have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| plans drawn up. So a permit has to be obtained for that so we can check it because of structural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1152)|
| 0:19:20| nature and fire related features also. Okay. Did you get that? Certificate of Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| Okay. Architectural certification. Sheriff's Department? I have a concern about how they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| going to contain the people that are having drinks in the back porch at the van area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1175)|
| 0:19:44| Well, if you could use that microphone, I'm going to have trouble hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| Us old folks have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Gray's over here. Easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Need to know how they're going to control their crowd from walking away from the venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1195)|
| 0:20:03| which is the stage area, if that's where they're going to have the beer, to keep them from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| wandering around in the parking lot and also inside the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| The business will be closed when the concerts take place, so they won't be able to enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| the business. And then there will be a fence, about three-quarters of the area is fenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| now. There will be temporary fencing put up, one exit, one entrance so that people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| come in with their tickets and they can leave that way. So at that time, they'll be checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| obviously going out. They won't be able to take anything outside on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| We are also going to have a full-time security staff of eight to twelve security people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| all the time, and we will also be employing four to six Knox County officers to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| us with that as well. We have spoke to not just this gentleman, but another gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Let me, is this yours, Commissioner? No, this is Brad's. Okay. Let me replow some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1262)|
| 0:21:11| ground before we get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| From the health department, it's okay. From fire, though, we need a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1274)|
| 0:21:24| Is there more verbiage than that that I need to state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| There was an existing inspection that was originally done on Monday. We revisited the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1289)|
| 0:21:38| site again on Wednesday and did a more in-depth inspection on the alarm system. In particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| with the assembly occupancy, the big thing that's going to change is they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| have to install a voice evac type alarm system. So we went back to evaluate that, make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| we can get the people, the occupant load, out the exit doors, down the stairs, things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| We do have items written on an existing inspection report for the facility, but we also are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| to need a certificate of occupancy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| Okay. So if I just stick with certificate of occupancy, it will contain your other concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| about being able to evacuate the building in case of emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| The code, an architect certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1348)|
| 0:22:39| Commissioner, I guess the question here is they have an amphitheater that was built and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| permitted and they received their certificate of occupancy on it, but the existing Harley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Davidson shop, some things were changed inside it. And so basically, I think that's the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| we're talking about more than anything is the Harley shop with the new assembly areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| that they have moved maybe, I'm assuming, it was approved for mercantile in 2004. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1384)|
| 0:23:14| we're just needing to see a permit that has been designed by an architect engineer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| reviewed by that, just certifying that it's okay. We'll issue a permit, inspect it, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| get the proper fire protection features and egress. I'd say there's no problem. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| a matter of getting the paperwork done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Okay. Thank you. And then last, Captain Mays, your concern was control of a crowd. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1417)|
| 0:23:46| the response was that during crowd situations, there will be no sale of beer in the licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1426)|
| 0:23:55| facility. Let me hear your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| If they have a fence that's containing the people that are drinking at the stage, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| was my only concern was that they have, where people can't just walk off and cross the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| lot or down the street or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| As I heard that addressed, it would be there would be no beer sales at this facility during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| those events. Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| I'm not sure I understand your last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Okay. Then I've become confused. I can understand if you're selling beer at an event that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| has to be crowd control and a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| What was your response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| We will have security guys, eight to ten security, our security company there all the time with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| also four to six Knox County officers there as well. We've spoken to, I don't know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| gentleman's name and I apologize, one of the other Knox County officers about going ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| and lining those folks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Okay. This has been our practice in the past. There has to be crowd control more than someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| walking the turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Absolutely, yeah. And everything will be fenced. It will be a complete fence if I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| brought a picture I've been thinking, but most of the area is fenced in now, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| will be a temporary fence put up where they can't just walk out into the street or walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| out into the side road for that matter. We're as concerned as this officer is about keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| the people on the premises while they're drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Okay. Thank you Mr. Ward. Thank you fellow commissioners for enduring my re-questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| of trying to raise the facts before we get to a motion. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1539)|
| 0:25:45| Well, I'll make a motion to approve with the pendings, but I'd like to speak to the pendings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| if I could. So the fire bureau went out on an inspection, filled out a list, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1549)|
| 0:25:58| we have a new list. How come we didn't hit it on the first? We've already went out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| two inspections? Is that what we're doing? Three inspections. Michael Brown. I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| hear your testimony. The reason I'm asking is, and I can understand being careful, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| if you come out and you do an inspection, you make a list, they hit all the lists, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| we make a new list. When does that? Have we done that? Have we added items to the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| every time we went out there? I think you're leaning on it. Hello? Rick Smith went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1586)|
| 0:26:39| Monday and looked and was uncomfortable with what he found, and I followed up Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| went out and did an evaluation of the facility. What it was, he went out and was expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| one thing and found something different. Such as? I have Mike's report here. The assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| areas and questions, Mike Brown is no longer with us. He may have went out at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| I think he may have done a temporary type occupancy out there for that, but there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| nothing in the file, nothing in the computer that shows he's approved that area. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| so they built the pavilion. The Harley-Davidson will be closed during the events. Did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| build bathrooms and stuff, Chuck? No, we just have portable restrooms. I'm sorry, portable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| restrooms. Okay. Porta-potties. Okay, and so with the assembly, what's the re-inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| of Harley-Davidson if it's going to be closed during the events? Or are we just making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| that in case they change their mind? Well, there evidently is assembly occupancy in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| back part of the Harley-Davidson shop, and I don't know if that's going to be used. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| his testimony, I think, is that it's not going to be used during these events. But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| the building has been changed. It does need a permit that has a licensed architect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| engineer just to review to make sure that the building will handle the extra load of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| the people. We don't have collapses. That's what we're looking for. And egress and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| fire-related features to protect the people that's in the building. Was the work permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| on the chain? When you say the building's changed, was the work permitted that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| did inside the building? I'm not sure that there was a lot of work done or just moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| furniture. There's not been any work done inside the building. He had a birthday party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| a couple of Sundays ago, and he set up some picnic tables, moved some motorcycles, set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| up some picnic tables for the birthday party. And when Travis came down, those hadn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| moved. Okay. Well, we need to... I want to make a motion to approve with the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| I just kind of... This is not the first time that we've had an inspection and then a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| re-inspection with different items on the list. And so that was kind of my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| and what I've heard. So that's my motion. Commissioner Thomas. I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| everybody's clear on this. If you haven't been down there on Lovell Road where the Harley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Davidson store is, they built a huge stage out back. And so the audience that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| there to watch the shows, 95% of them are going to be outdoors in the parking lot or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| near the stage area standing there. There are some porches on the back of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| that will be occupied, which I guess is what's the concern there, because those people would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| have access to inside the building during the events. I just want to make sure everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| clear on what we're talking about. That's the concern there, not necessarily people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| standing from the stage outdoors. Okay. Commissioner McKenzie. The patios that you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| talking about, Bob, the only way... We're going to shut the dealership down, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| is separate entrances with an elevator to get in and out of those balconies. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| dealership will be closed during those. Commissioner McKenzie. Yeah, and I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| Not having visited this location, is there a way for us to pass this permit with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| said? I mean, basically... And I guess I'm wondering, I would hate for you all to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| money as if you're going to open up the dealership and you're not ever going to do that. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| we could put a hook in that says basically you're going to use the patios and outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| areas, would that change the fire protection code? Because voice activation, I mean, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| can be pricey. About $20,000. Yeah, I'm sure. And so I would hate to kill this flea with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| a sledgehammer when you're not really using those facilities. So again, not having laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| eyes on the premises, is there a way? I guess, I don't know if it's to the law director or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| someone else. Is there a way for us to pass this permit with those exclusions, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| only use patios and outdoor areas? Well, beer permits are issued for the location itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1868)|
| 0:31:26| And we don't have a way to segregate that location. I wish I could say yes. You could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| segregate part of the location by going back to the property assessor or something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| that. That's a great point. And then, you know, there's ways to do it, but I can't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| advise you how to do it. But I mean, what we have before us right now, we're stuck with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| what we have before us. Thank you. Commissioner Andrews? Oh, I'm sorry. Apologize. If there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1907)|
| 0:31:56| be no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve pending some items. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1916)|
| 0:32:06| in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries. Thank you. We also obtained our sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| tax stuff today, so I hadn't forgotten about that until I thought about it on Friday. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| you. Thank you, Mr. Ward and Mr. Copeland. Oh, we do need a copy of the certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=1941)|

| 0:34:30| on a previous inspection. Okay. Coach? No problem. Sheriff's Department? I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2070)|

| 0:36:01| Mungin, good luck in your business. Thank you. Commissioner Brown, do you wish to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| a discussion item? Just a matter of notification. Most of y'all I guess saw in the paper that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| are on the news that the city is considering dropping the 300 foot rule, and that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| we might be on our radar down the line, so we need to be kind of watching to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| goes on. Thank you, Commissioner Brown. Seeing no further lights, if there be no objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2192)|

| 0:41:55| If you had asked her when they were married in 1942 what she expected out of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| the probable answer would have been get this war job over, get my husband home from Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2522)|
| 0:42:12| Little did she know that would be far from the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Due to her love of family, church, and community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2536)|

| 0:42:59| The day of our last meeting here, my brothers took our mom to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| Three days later, I took her home to her home, and she passed away at the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2587)|
| 0:43:17| What did she accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=2597)|

| 0:54:09| Do I hear a motion it be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| I guess I'll ask the law director, is this, can we speak to whether to add it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| or can we only simply vote at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| I'm not speaking of the merits, so just speak to whether we should add it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| The only motion on the table is whether or not you're going to add it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| So I can't speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| That's all you're voting on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| And the merits, if you voted on, the merits will be discussed later when it's brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| This is just added to the agenda for discussion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Okay, but if I have some discussion along the lines of why we should not add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| Oh, you can do that, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| A discussion of why you do or do not want it added, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3298)|
| 0:55:05| With that, on this particular one, it just came up fairly haphazardly and hastily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3305)|
| 0:55:12| And it just seems to be, you know, kind of a knee-jerk add-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| I don't know whether they have merits in Memphis, Shelby County or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| but I guess here in Knotts County I've not, I can't see where anyone's come up in my eight-plus years to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3321)|
| 0:55:29| So I think if we're going to do it, if we're going to do it, I think it needs to be a deliberate process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| maybe get the public involved in this before us to add this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| Basically, saying that Knotts County supports this, I think is a bit premature at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| We will begin with Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=3352)|

| 1:11:58| What we have before us is to make a Commission appointment to the Community Action Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4318)|
| 1:12:07| a representative from the Board of Commissioners to this board, one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| We will accomplish that by receiving nominations from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4335)|
| 1:12:25| And if we receive more than three nominations, we will go through that process of voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| and the lowest number person falling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Seeing no lights, what we will do is receive nominations beginning with Commissioner McKenzie in the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4359)|
| 1:12:52| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Commissioner McKenzie passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| Go ahead and call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| We will call the roll for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| Commissioner Broyles, would you like to consider nominating someone to take your position on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| since you are the person most familiar with its activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| I don't want to nominate anyone unless they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| So I'm waiting for someone to raise their hand and say that they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| CAC covers a lot of area. They take on a lot of issues and have a lot of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| So I hope that there's somebody who's interested and wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| Could you then give us some insight as to when they meet and what they cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| Yes. They generally meet the 4th of Thursday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| Starting at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| And it's a fairly large board. It's a very diverse board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| The CAC covers a lot of senior issues, Head Start, mobile meals, all kinds of things related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4439)|
| 1:14:13| The senior issues probably are the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| The senior issues probably cover the Office on Aging and senior issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4459)|
| 1:14:29| They probably take up the majority of the CAC time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| And that's something that I've always been very passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| So I hope that there's someone else who's interested in taking that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| 10 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| It's a great board to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Chairman, could I just make this comment before you go on with your roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| In my opinion, I think it would be best to have a commissioner who is continuing service after August 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4500)|
| 1:15:12| rather than somebody like myself who's going off August 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Oh, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Commissioner Smith passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4531)|

| 1:15:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4537)|

| 1:15:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| I nominate Commissioner Bustler if he chose to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Commissioner Anders nominates Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Commissioner Bustler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| Sorry if you nominate, I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| I nominate you, sir, if you've got two shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4570)|

| 1:16:13| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| I think Commissioner Bustler would make an excellent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| Commissioner Thomas also votes for Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Commissioner Brantley passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| I make a motion to make the nomination cease and Commissioner Bustler is nominated by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Commissioner Bustler, will you serve if appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| I will and I would like to sunshine a meeting with Amy so she can tell me what all I've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| What we properly have before us is that Commissioner Bustler be appointed by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| You are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| Resolution 115 is accepting the resignation of Commissioner Amy Bross from the Knox County Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| and appointing Commissioner to succeed Commissioner Bross on the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| and serve the remaining portion of her unexpired term, which term expires August 31, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| Madam Clerk, we will go through the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| Commissioners, seeing no lights on for discussion, we will go through this same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| Mr. Chairman, who are the current members on this committee now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Brown, you and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| And Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| And Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| No, just Mike, Dave and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| And Mike will be leaving in August as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| So, it'll be good to get somebody on there now and then you'll have to replace Mike in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4683)|
| 1:18:15| And Commissioner McKenzie, you wish to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| Well, I guess as we talk about this, I kind of disagree with Commissioner Brown in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| I don't think we need to be looking specifically for someone that's not going to stop, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| that's going to, office is going to end at the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| I think it's time for, there'll be a new commission sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| There'll be new faces, new personality, new likes and dislikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| So, I would hate to tie us only to the commissioners whose terms are going to go beyond August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| So, just a point of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| I think that last CAC appointment went to 18 anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Those are FY18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| Yeah, that one does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Okay, what about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| This one is until the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| In response to Commissioner McKenzie's comments, come August 30th, sitting commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4753)|
| 1:19:22| there will be one, only be one left, and that will be yourself on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| So, you'd have two newbies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| To me, you know, I think it makes sense to have some continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| So, that's my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| And seeing no lights, in keeping with my rotational policy of who gets to go first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4777)|

| 1:21:45| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| But I would like to withdraw my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4907)|

| 1:21:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| I'd like to withdraw my name and let John have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4913)|

| 1:22:06| Motion to appoint by acclamation is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4932)|

| 1:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| I'm page nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| Do we have some UT journalism students with us today or what group do we have with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| I thought maybe our audience was swelled with people that were here on the mayor's behalf of the reading of Fair Housing Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4964)|
| 1:22:57| So, they didn't get up and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| They must be here representing someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| So, someone please stand and say who the visitors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| Are there visitors here with the University of Tennessee or School of Journalism or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| You're the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Yes, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=4994)|

| 1:23:39| 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Next item is 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee approving a construction contract in the amount of $2,266,626.45 with APEC Atlantic Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5023)|
| 1:23:56| for the construction of various roadway improvements related to the new Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Motion is properly before us, properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| Seeing no lights for discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5055)|
| 1:24:23| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee urging the Tennessee State Education Committee to reconsider the amendment to the University of Tennessee budget that would define the University of Tennessee's Office for Diversity and Inclusion, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5069)|
| 1:24:46| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| I would like to first, I guess, start out by thanking former Commissioner and current State Senator Richard Briggs and former Commissioner and current House of Representatives member Joe Armstrong and whatever they did to get these measures, I would say, pulled, dropped from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5089)|
| 1:25:14| I think it's pretty much dead on arrival, at least for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| Hopefully this will not come back and folks will dig in and see some of the issues that I tried to bring forward in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5120)|
| 1:25:29| I think it was the case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| For an entity such as the University of Tennessee to be a vibrant, first-class university, it has to look beyond certain walls in terms of race, ethnicity, religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5133)|
| 1:25:49| So, while I don't necessarily condone those two things that brought the big ugly light on the office, I think those things were handled by the President and the Chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5149)|
| 1:26:02| And so, it's for those reasons and the fact that this seems to be a bill without merit for this session or that's not going to go forth in this session, I move to withdraw this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5162)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| The item is withdrawn by the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5187)|
| 1:26:33| Consideration of resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee expressing support of Senate Bill 749, House Bill 779 to provide county government protection from adverse effects of the city's de-annexation and to recidivize efforts of previous regreggious forced annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5193)|
| 1:26:58| Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did you wish to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| Sure, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| We have to do the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Okay, I'd like to make a motion to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| Motion is probably before Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Do you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you. Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Most of the members of the Knox County Commission are probably aware of some of the news stories regarding the de-annexation bill that's been working its way through the Tennessee legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5251)|
| 1:27:42| About 10-12 days ago, the House of Representatives passed Bill 779 on an 86-25 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5262)|
| 1:27:52| This basically deals with several cities, including Knoxville, Memphis, Chattanooga, Johnson City, Kingsport, and Mont Eagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5272)|
| 1:28:04| Currently, tomorrow, the Senate was to take it up, and they deferred it back to their state and local committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5284)|
| 1:28:17| And tomorrow, there's going to be representatives from the four major cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| Their county commissioners are going to be there from Shelby County, Hamilton County, Sullivan County, and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| What we're doing is asking for a resolution of support of Senate Bill and House Bill 779| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5310)|
| 1:28:40| to rectify some of the issues that were addressed with annexation over 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| to where citizens now would have an opportunity to decide if they want to stay inside the municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| And I'll stop there and open it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Others have questions, and we're very fortunate to have a Deputy Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| who was very much involved 20 years ago in this original public chapter, 1101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| So he would be, I'm sure, available for any comments and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Yeah, first of all, I think we've already sent a – some commissioners have already sent a letter in support of this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| I think there were some phone calls made to ask to put their signature on the letter last couple of Fridays ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| But, you know, this is a Ratcher-Congressman kind of deal in a way similar to what Commissioner McKenzie's last proposal was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5369)|
| 1:29:40| And what bothers me about this is there's due to be 115 amendments to this bill before it's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| You're going to support this bill as a commission, and you don't know what's going to be in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| You don't know what cities are going to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| I mean, the Lieutenant Governor, who's the second, some say the first, most powerful man in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| has already said he's against it because of the way it's been drawn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| I think it's dangerous to take a bill that has amendments on it, that's going to have more amendments on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| and put our name on it as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| I understand the process and the discussion, but they've taken the date out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| The last amendment took the date out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| This can go back to Fountain City de-annexing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| And I think that's a critical mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| And so be careful what you support when you support a bill that's going through the House at such a rapid pace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| being kicked back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| I don't know that it's smart for a commission to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Whether you feel like it benefits the county or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| you don't know what you're about to support when you make this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| I was just going to say that it was my understanding that a letter was sent recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| and the commissioners who wished to sign that letter had the opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| So I don't see any reason why this needs to be before us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| or why we need to pass this resolution as a full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| I think Brad's points are very well made, that we don't know what exactly we're going to end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| So I think that it was great to send the letter for the commissioners who wanted their names on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| to send that, and I think that says what needs to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| And there's no need for us to do this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| especially when, as Brad pointed out, we're not sure exactly what it is yet that we're going to be supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| I've said this before and I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| Passing resolutions for something we can't vote on frustrates me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| Because if I'm sitting over there in Nashville and all I get is a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| you never call me, you never email me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| I'm wondering how dedicated you are to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| So, you know, I'm going to vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| but I sent a letter to all of the committee members of the State and Local Government Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5521)|
| 1:32:11| voicing to them exactly what I was supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| Not any amendments, add on to it, but exactly what I'm supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| And I urge anybody that is supporting this, or if you're against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| these are the people you need to contact and let them know and get your feelings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| Because, honestly, I don't think all these resolutions do as much as we must think they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| Seeing no further lights, no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| I didn't add in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| Mr. Busler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| I was sitting here thinking about some of the thoughts that were brought up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| But the problem of it is, you're either for it or you're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| Whether it passes like this or we go down there and say, hey, we like it the way it was originally done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| we need to go down there and let them know that Knox County is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| Whether we send it down here like this or we say, okay, we like the first one, we don't want it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5594)|
| 1:33:22| we need to go down there and let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| And so I'm in favor of anything we send down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| In fact, I think we're going to go down there and speak on it tomorrow anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5609)|
| 1:33:37| Seeing no further lights, no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| This will be roll call vote, beginning with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| I'm waiting for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Yes, approves the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| No, defeats the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5636)|

| 1:34:58| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| amending Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 9, entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| Procurement Code, to provide for various changes to the Procurement Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5703)|

| 1:35:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Motion before us is to approve on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| Mr. Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| Yes, Hugh Holt, Knox County Purchasing Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I'm here to answer any questions you ladies and gentlemen may have about the proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| Hugh, could you cover that last part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| But that, you know, there are several elements to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| The professional services acquisition piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Yes, under Section 2-670, under professional services acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| what we are attempting to do along with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| is to make sure that the county's code is consistent with the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| and the law director's office has requested that there be some verbiage stricken from our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5790)|
| 1:36:39| in order to achieve that consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And it's in regard to, actually this is deleted from the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| was or superintendent of schools or the chief administrative officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| And basically that that authority will only lie with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| And in acquisitions of legal services, it will only lie with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| Yeah, that troubles me in that, so if there's a potential issue between schools and the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5823)|
| 1:37:15| it just seems, you know, there may be a point and purpose that they want to get an independent counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| and that may be counter to what either the law director or the mayor would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5842)|
| 1:37:28| To me it just seems that when you're talking about an organization as large as schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5848)|
| 1:37:38| that they should have some abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| And this kind of limits their, greatly, not kindly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| greatly limits their ability to manage their own department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| I mean, you know, things like that will always have to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| I mean, so it's going to come through as this just seems to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| kind of cutting it off before it even gets to us, for us to even vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| It just, I think that particular language is fairly strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5883)|
| 1:38:12| I'll have to defer to the law department on the school's authority and autonomy of authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5892)|
| 1:38:20| Mr. Boote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| Mr. Chairman, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Yes, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| What that's in there for is state law strictly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| Number one, the law director has nothing to do with the procurement of professional services by the mayor or by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5913)|
| 1:38:41| But when they changed the law providing for an appointed superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| as opposed to an elected superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| the legislature divested many powers from the school superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| one of which was included that he himself could approve these sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| That was divested when they changed the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| Now the law says that the procurement or the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| once a board of education makes a decision on a professional service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| is either carried out by the executive committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| which by law is the superintendent and the chairman of the board of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| unless there is a county with a procurement code such as we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| in which case that duty falls in with the procurement department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| It's a technical legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| It doesn't mean the board of education cannot approve professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| once they're properly put forth and advertised and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| It just says that the superintendent, unlike in days when the superintendent was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| the superintendent does not have that singular authority to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| nor does the executive committee because the state legislature has said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| that now falls to the county purchasing or, as we're changing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| the procurement department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| So if the school board superintendent wanted to enter in a contract with a legal firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| you're saying that the procurement process is the sum total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| and the law department won't say yes or no as to whether they can or can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| The procurement of legal services has already been determined by the Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| The board of education has no authority whatsoever under a judgment from the Chancery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| with regard to procuring professional legal services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| That stays strictly with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| All other professional services would fall under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| The board of education wants a professional service for advising somebody on how to teach a course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| That's up to them and within their budget, and then they approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| and then it comes over to the procurement department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| and I've never known them on these small contracts to say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| and they wouldn't have authority to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| That has to go through by state law through our procurement office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| So it's a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| When they changed the law, they didn't think of all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| and now when you look at them, that's what we're trying to cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| And I guess I understand that if we were, you know, totally on board with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6089)|
| 1:41:38| but there's also, and I guess we need to dig into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| there's some postulations, some theories that because we're a charter form of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6104)|
| 1:41:52| that we can elect our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| But what you're saying is this ordinance strengthens the appointed superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6114)|
| 1:42:01| which is codified in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| I think that's what you said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| because when we went from an elected superintendent statewide to an appointed superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| this needed to be cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| So if we're even entertaining, which some folks have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| an elected superintendent because we're a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| then why do we need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| If we need, you know, you see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| I see what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| but there's no authority by virtue of Supreme Court rulings for a charter government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| to elect or vote to have a provision to elect a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| That is controlled strictly by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| State law says superintendents will be employed by their respective boards of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| So that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| I was just making the comment that with an elected superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| the elected superintendent had a lot of duties that he could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| and when they changed the law, they divested the superintendent's office of many of those duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| and this was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| I'm in support of this because I do think it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| that's another hook in making sure that we're not entertaining this notion of elected superintendents within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| the motion is properly before us to approve this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| It will be read again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6222)|

| 1:44:06| Discussion regarding the Knox County school bus safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| The reason I've added this to the agenda is that I wanted to make sure we discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6254)|
| 1:44:22| so we know exactly what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Now, I've spoken to bus contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| Some of them that are here that I've known, gosh, all my life almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| Dr. Rick Grubb, who heads up the transportation at the Knox County school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| I've known him as well about all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| I trust both of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Dr. McIntyre is here as well as other people from the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| What I wanted to do was make sure we knew exactly what the transportation status is at the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6286)|
| 1:44:57| Dr. McIntyre, if you would join us up here so you can correct me when I say something incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6297)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Approximately how many buses are on the roads every day for the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| Jim McIntyre, Superintendent of Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| We run about 350 school buses a day through our bus contractors with Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| If I'm not mistaken, it's a large number of miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| It's approximately, I think I have this right, about 20,000 miles a day that our buses travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| And I don't think some of the people I talk to in the county don't realize there are that many buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| and they travel that many miles every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| And if you really look at how many miles are traveled every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| and the amount of instances that we've had, it's small compared to the normal transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| other forms of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| However, one instance is too many to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| So a couple of the things that you and I have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| if you would share with the commission here and people that are watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| what you are doing to help shore up some of the transportation department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| And, of course, I know you've had a couple of ideas as well, and we welcome those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| But, you know, I think over the last few years we've really increased our expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6394)|
| 1:46:41| our requirements around both service and safety in our transportation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| with regard to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| And just a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| So just this year alone we've implemented new training for all of our school bus contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| and the drivers that they employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| A lot of people don't know the structure of our system is that we contract for transportation services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| with about 70 school bus contractors, and the school bus drivers are employed by those contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6425)|
| 1:47:12| And, of course, we oversee the overall transportation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| and have lots of systems and structures in place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| But just in the past year alone we've put in place additional training for school bus contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| and drivers both around distracted driving and also around working with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| and student management on school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| We've put in place, we've begun our installation of putting in place video monitoring systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| on all of our school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| In fact, these are two camera systems, one looking backward and one looking forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| in each of our buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| And we've got, that's going to be a multiyear effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| but we're making extraordinary progress moving forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| We've put in place this year a transportation safety officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| This is one of our school security officers, Lieutenant James Puckett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| and his full-time job is to think about and create strategies around making sure that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6481)|
| 1:48:09| you know, that we are attentive to safety in our transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| And one of the things that we've been able to put in place this year with that transportation safety officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| and the training he's been able to do is a safety checkride system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| So on a very regular basis we have either Lieutenant Puckett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| or one of the uniformed officers that he has trained will, on an unannounced basis, board a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6508)|
| 1:48:36| They will do a brief visual inspection of the equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| and then they'll observe the operation of the school bus for a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| and really make an assessment of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| the school bus driver is doing everything that they're supposed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| and also identify any deficiencies or any challenges or any issues that may be observed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| and provide that feedback to the driver and to the school bus contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| We've also put in place a new position this year, a customer service manager in our transportation department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| which has been extraordinarily helpful in having a single point of contact for parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| for school bus contractors, for school bus drivers, for others to provide information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| to have issues addressed, to really be a wonderful point of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| and communication in our transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| And then the other thing that we've put in place in the last year or so is an application for our parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| It's called Where's My Bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| And so you can sign up through our website, and it's actually an online application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| and you can have it on your mobile device, which shows in real time where your child's school bus is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| And so you know if it's coming around the corner and you're waiting for the student to be picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| or if you're waiting for the student to come home, you know where that school bus is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| And so that's been a very popular application with our parents and with our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| and we think that's also an important safety enhancement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| It's just having good information about where that school bus is and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| And also, Commissioner, on an annual basis, there are a variety of strategies that we have in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| We do an annual license check and motor vehicle records check of each of the school bus drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| that are employed by the bus contractors in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| Each of the drivers is required, and some of these are simply requirements of the transportation regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6620)|
| 1:50:29| But each of our school bus drivers that are employed by our contractors have a physical on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| and that information is provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| There is a requirement for random drug testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| and we're required to randomly drug test at least 50% or over 50% of the school bus drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| that are employed by our contractors on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| and at least 10% are to be subject to an annual random alcohol test as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| So I think those are all important strategies that we have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| and I'm also really excited to let you know that the recommendation that I made to the Board of Education last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| in terms of our fiscal year 17 budget includes an additional investment of $1 million for our transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6669)|
| 1:51:18| And a lot of that will go, the vast majority of that actually will go to enhance payments to our bus contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6678)|
| 1:51:28| for a couple different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| As I said at the outset, we have increased our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| We've increased our requirements both around service and safety in our transportation program for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| We want to make sure that our bus contractors are able to continue to meet those expectations and those high standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6700)|
| 1:51:47| and we want to make sure that this model that we have, which is a sort of a community small business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| continues to be a viable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| We believe that this investment will allow our school bus contractors to continue to provide a high level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| and safety in our transportation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| We're hopeful that those additional investments will allow them to buy equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| or maintain equipment that they have on the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| and also hopefully enhance the compensation of school bus drivers that they employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| so that we can make sure that we have the highest quality drivers on the road for our children as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| From a variety of perspectives, we're doing a tremendous amount to ensure that we have high quality service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| and a high level of safety in our transportation program for our students in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| I'm very encouraged with the additional million dollars that you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| Again, I've spoken to a lot of contractors who feel squeezed over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| and that some of them are not even breaking even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| They're having to put their own money in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Is there a commitment in years to come where we can keep increasing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| so we can try to get them to where they get their heads above water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| Commissioner, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| The way that I've talked about that with our school board is really we believe this is the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| toward continuing some enhanced investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| We believe it will take a few years with that level of increased investment in our transportation program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6783)|
| 1:53:10| to get to a place where we're in, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| that our bus contractors feel like they're at a pretty good level in terms of the compensation and the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| to be able to meet the really rigorous expectations that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| So we feel good about it, and we think it's a good first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| It's actually, when you look at what that's going to allow us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| it's probably going to be in the neighborhood of a $2,300 to a $2,400 increase in what we're able to pay per bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6811)|
| 1:53:40| And so couple that with the $600 per bus addition that we made this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| and that's going to be about almost $3,000 per bus per year that we've increased by next August in a single year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6826)|
| 1:53:54| That's a significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| It's about an 8.5% increase in the total amount that we pay to our bus contractors on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| So it's a pretty significant additional investment, and we think it's a good step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| And I just want everybody to understand that's watching this or will read about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| you know, to be a bus driver, get up early in the morning and drive the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| and then you've got your meal of your day, and then you come back and do it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| is not a job that a lot of people can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| And they feel like maybe the pay has not been where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| But I'm hoping, and I know you can't speak about future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| but I'm hoping that the temperament of the Board of Education is that they can continue this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| so we can get those salaries where they need to be, where the contractors can survive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| and we have a lot more people that are we get a very big pool of drivers that want to drive that we can choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6881)|
| 1:54:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| And, you know, I completely agree it's an important job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| We want to make sure our kids get to school safely and on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| so that they can be successful in the classroom and be prepared for a bright future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| So it's an important job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| We want to make sure we make the appropriate investments to make sure that our bus contractors are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| our bus drivers are successful in getting our kids to school safely and on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| Dr. McIntyre, you've outlined a lot of stuff here to take care of buses, drivers, et cetera, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6920)|
| 1:55:30| But from what I'm hearing from the bus drivers, some I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| one of the biggest problems is the behavior of the little brats on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| Excuse my French.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| But that's not nearly as bad as what some of these drivers call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| They have no control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| The kids don't listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| They have no authority to control them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| So what do they do but take them back to the school and drop them off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| Okay, so then if they're halfway through the route, that throws them behind on the rest of the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| So what, you know, if you're talking about safety on buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| the behavior of the kids on the bus is a number one priority to me and the safety of the driving of that bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| So what are we going to do to address that problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| You know, I think there are a variety of ways to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| One is that we do actually have disciplinary procedures for students on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| And, you know, we see that as an extension of the school, that they're on their way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| or the way home from school, that we do have disciplinary procedures that we put in place in those settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| And then also I mentioned, you know, we've also provided some training to the bus drivers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| And for those who took advantage of that training this fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| it really, I think, was a very productive and powerful opportunity to learn a little bit more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| what kind of strategies can they put in place when they're driving the bus to set expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| and to make sure that students are meeting those expectations in terms of behavior on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| So, you know, I think there are some things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| And it's really a partnership between the school bus driver and the school bus contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| and the school system and the school to be able to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| and frankly, our parents and our community to make sure that students are meeting our expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| not only in school, but on the way to and from school as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| Well, but it's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| That's where I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| The drivers that I've talked to feel helpless because they tell little Johnny to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| He says, you don't own me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| You can't tell me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| You're just a driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| So what's the driver to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| You know, watch little Johnny in the mirror while he runs it into a telephone pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| To me, that's serious business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| I would agree with you today that the kids, you know, this happened in my going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| He wouldn't have taken you back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| He'd have left you out there in the middle of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| And you would have found your own way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| And when you got home, you would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| We don't do that anymore, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Maybe you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| If a parent had to go dig them out of the woods somewhere along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| maybe they'd make the little rat behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| But I'm saying it's a whole different culture today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| I'm not happy with it, but we've got to live with it and deal with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| and do something about it to make it safer for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| If the kids don't know that the driver has the authority to report them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| to send them back to school, to put them, you don't ride my bus anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| you know, something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| And, Commissioner, the other thing I would say, and I know Mr. Oaks may have something to add as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| but we also will somewhat frequently employ adult monitors on the bus as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| If there's a particular issue on a particular bus, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| that becomes problematic for a period of time or for the entire school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7127)|
| 1:58:51| we might deploy a school bus monitor onto that bus as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| So, you know, we don't do that on every bus, but certainly where things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| if there might be a particular issue that needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| that's also a strategy that we have available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| So who do I get approval from if I want to ride one of the buses as a monitor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| No, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| You know, Commissioner, it's probably not appropriate, but I appreciate the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7157)|
| 1:59:23| maybe you can apply for the job after you retire from this opportunity that you have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| No way in you know where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| Not from what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| And I think, won't the cameras, once we kick cameras on the back of the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| and the driver has more proof of what is going on, that some of that may stop, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7183)|
| 1:59:52| And right up to the wire here, and I've talked to Dr. McIntyre about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| and I just got a text two minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| Andy White at Ted Russell Ford at Walker Springs and Parkside just agreed that he would sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7199)|
| 2:00:06| along with WIVK and a TV station to be named, a monthly awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7206)|
| 2:00:14| five $100 checks for the top five safest bus drivers in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7214)|
| 2:00:22| so that we could start pointing out the people that do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| and have done a good job for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| So I'm tickled to death he's agreed to do that, and we'll have more details on that coming soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| I think that's a fabulous idea, and what it does is really highlight and accentuate the positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| because we have, you know, the vast majority of our contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| the vast majority of our school bus drivers doing their job and doing it exceedingly well every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| and care deeply about our kids, care deeply about getting them to school on time and safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| and I think that's a great way to acknowledge that and recognize that and reward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| So thank you for your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Thank you, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for being with us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Also, Mr. Oaks, thanks, and Dr. Davis, thank you for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Discussion regarding our wireless electronic voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| We brought this up last year, by that I meant before January 1st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7286)|
| 2:01:33| and we talked about that system, and we kind of left it laying around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| because we didn't find out about the funding for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| but we do have an opportunity now to put on a test of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| because we are in the budget system where we can budget this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| and it can be refunded to us if we decide not to use the system or systems we want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| But the big thing about it is people on television can see exactly how we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| They can also see what's coming, you know, who is speaking at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| and also for the desk for the chairmanship up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| you can also get a program on there to let you know by the microphones you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| when you press the button who is next in line to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Also, there's another program in there that helps us go through the Roberts Rules of Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| where somebody has spoke on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| It will also tell you what rotation they're in if nobody else speaks to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| when their turn comes back up where they can re-speak to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| It also makes it easier for our people here that's taking records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| because they can get everything off the system and type it in later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| And if we ever wanted to take this show on the road, it's portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| You can take it and be portable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| So you can do any sections in the county if we wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| Again, if we didn't want to do it, we don't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| But you could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Like the Bob and Ed show, we could take it on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| But I think it's something that we need to look at because the counties around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| you have Anderson County, Hamilton County, and some of the other counties around here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| are using the system and they really enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| And they really use it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| So I would like to make a motion that we say can you do a semi-funding to this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7396)|
| 2:03:24| to get one here to see how it works, to see how it could help us out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| and how we could keep our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| Let me pause you for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| Normally we cannot move from a discussion item to a motion on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| If you'd prepare a resolution for us for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| And like I said, it's just a trial, but we need to get something from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| say here we're going to put it on a charge card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| If we don't use it, they will refund our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| So it is a 30-day trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| I don't have a card, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| I'm not on that same financial institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| But anyway, if we could do that and how we do the process of getting it here to test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7450)|
| 2:04:16| And again, there's no cutting of holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| There's no wiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| It's all just lay here on the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| I put a monitor up in front of our chairman so he can see what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| It's called wireless, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| Okay, it's wireless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| So I'd like to have that come up if it's all right with the rest of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| to put something before us and see if we can do that through the purchasing department in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| His last line finally got to what I was going to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| He said through the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| Purchasing has reviewed this in the past, in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| They already checked that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| Do you remember that, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| We had a sample in here a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7511)|
| 2:05:21| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Just a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| With the price being $14,700, you probably need to get three written quotes to even start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| You don't want to get somebody an unfair advantage even if it is free, I wouldn't imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| Secondly, this room and everything in here is really operated through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7538)|
| 2:05:47| So we're not the only ones that use this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| It's used by city council, MPC, school board, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| So we want to make sure that if we went this route, it would fit everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| and everyone would want to use it and share in the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7560)|
| 2:06:09| You run the risk by saying we're going to try it free for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| and then we have to go and get three quotes and then we get three quotes and then somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| It's cheaper, but you like one better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| I think it would be better getting three quotes to even start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| But I think it's something that we probably need to talk with PBA about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| because this room is basically halved 50-50 with the city of Knoxville as far as cost goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7593)|
| 2:06:40| Everything that we do, we half that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| The system is extremely portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| There's nothing that fits to the walls or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| It goes through a central laptop like Joe Lee has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| We have individual little wireless remotes that you can collect the same with the name tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7618)|
| 2:07:05| There's nothing that affects PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| And if later down the road we want to apply this to the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7630)|
| 2:07:16| But we just wanted to look at it for the county commission first because, I mean, Blount County uses it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| Anderson County, all the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| I think even Rhone County uses this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| And I think, Mr. Myers, before when we looked at this, there aren't three resources for this type product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7646)|
| 2:07:33| If I'm remembering, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| But I don't think you're going to find three other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7658)|
| 2:07:46| In the world of technology and this type of data distribution and this type of voting system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7666)|
| 2:07:56| I would be surprised if there's not at least three dozen out there that does this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| But we'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| But I would recommend that we also, especially if this is not going to involve PBA telecommunications and technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7686)|
| 2:08:17| that we involve our IT department because I'm assuming that somebody's got to load all this stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| These agendas have to be there for you to actually vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| So that would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7709)|
| 2:08:36| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| I was going to kind of get to what Hugh's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| What needs to happen is the commission chair and he said request through Hugh Holt to research additional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7721)|
| 2:08:50| and get RFP drawn up through IT and him and then Chris, a budget request from Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| Is that how the process should work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| You shouldn't bring a product in here that gives somebody else the inside track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| If we're going to bring three quotes in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| then we're going to have to have some sort of guidelines of how it operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| and we'll have to look at some people bringing some information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| And then once we try it, we have it on that trial basis to where all facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7762)|
| 2:09:30| whether it's the city, the county, the MPC, or whatever other board meets in here, it can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| But we want to look at it as being more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| Now, if some people want to use the system we've got now, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| But other people could go ahead and use it because there is no insulation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| So that's the big thing that was important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| And that's a great point, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| That's exactly what I need to be able to do my job is a scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| I need to understand what our expectations are of this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| and that way I can develop some deliverables for these vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| and we can come back with a product that meets your need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7812)|
| 2:10:20| Continuing, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| The big thing is that they have people that were willing to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| and work with our IT department to make sure that it is a process that we can handle internally after they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7829)|
| 2:10:39| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| You know, I think this is a solution in searching for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7843)|
| 2:10:49| I just don't see where we have our meetings are publicly televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7849)|
| 2:10:59| Our clerk's office records the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| They announce the name and repeats the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| So even if you're not speaking to the mic properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| that information has been verified into the microphone and in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| And to be quite honest, as it relates to Robert's Rules of Order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| I mean, we better be careful what we've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| Like on this issue, I'm not pointing the finger because I do it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| You probably spoke three times to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| But it's been good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| So if we stifle that conversation, like I said, you just asked Hugh a great question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| but you would have been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| So if we go with Robert's Rules and if this thing tells our chair that this is the second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7902)|
| 2:11:49| or this will be the third time Commissioner McKenzie spoke to an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| now we have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| So, again, I guess I'm trying to find out where this formality is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| I'm the person that has, up until the time Commissioner Wright has changed this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| for the previous seven and a half years I voted first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| So, you know, I'm the one that maybe penalized the hardest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| but I still firmly believe that we have to have some informality to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7930)|
| 2:12:18| If we get too rigid, if we think IT is going to solve all the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| I mean, I'm sure it's become maybe it's an issue I spoke too long on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| or an issue that you spoke too long on, but that's the way we legislate, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| And the chair has that discretion to cut a conversation off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| So I guess I don't know where we're trying to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| I know Hamilton and Blount love their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| Commissioner Brown, I think about five or six years ago, I forget, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| I don't know if it was Hammond or Strickland, but it was a while ago that we brought it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| and we tested it and it did all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| But I don't know for this body whether we want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| And if we do, you know, I'm with Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| I think it needs to be divided at least four ways, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| if that's what we're going to do for this hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| So just some things to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7992)|
| 2:13:15| Commissioner Oyenbee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7995)|
| 2:13:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7996)|
| 2:13:17| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| I think what Brad said, the first thing we've got to do is just either the chairman does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| or Charlie can get with the purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| and work out what the scope is that we want to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| and then we can bring an RFP for us to approve and he can send out the RFP from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8012)|
| 2:13:39| I mean, I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8022)|
| 2:13:43| I'm just saying that I think we're trying to move too quick on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| without knowing what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| Commissioner, if the price is determined to be less than $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| we're not required to issue a formal solicitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| We can get three written informal quotes, which takes about a third of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8040)|
| 2:14:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| You made me forget what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| Way to go, Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| That's a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| Hugh for $700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| Back to the school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| I want to ride that bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| I think in Hugh's examination of this problem, this situation, this answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8071)|
| 2:14:40| whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| I think it would be appropriate that he not only know what our needs would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| but are the other entities, the school board, the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| are they interested and what would their ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| it's going to have to be put together in a dovetail manner to get one system for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| I mean, what we want might not serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| There may be two or three little things in it that the council don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| so they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| But if we go at this all together and he puts together the wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8110)|
| 2:15:16| as many wants as he can of each group, then he's got something to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| Right, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| Correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| Where's the bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| Am I next, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| Your light lit up right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| Well, my light's on, but I don't ñ oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| Well, you know, some of these boards operate with 30 people or something on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| but, I mean, we're 11 guys, so we're getting along pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| We can throw paper back at each other and find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| But just a suggestion, since it's PBA's authority, it's their room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8146)|
| 2:15:54| and they're in charge of all this, why don't we suggest that they do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| and they provide this equipment for us since we're ñ I mean, we're paying them rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| Why should we buy something for PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8163)|
| 2:16:11| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Two things come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| First of all, I think, Chairman, I mean, what Commissioner Brantley said there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| I want as many people paying for this as possible if we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| I mean, I've spread it out with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| Get MPC to pony up some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| Everybody, if we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| The other thing that concerns me is doesn't this, what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| really benefit a board or a committee that has lots of roll call votes, not ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8194)|
| 2:16:42| I mean, 90% of our votes or 95 are just yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| and then there's no need to punch a button or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| So just make sure that whatever it is that you're looking at, it's something we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8210)|
| 2:16:58| That was going to be my comment as we try to wrap this down, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| is that since last September we've had enough roll call votes to get around the table one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8223)|
| 2:17:15| and back to Commissioner Oyenbee, and that's with a whole bunch of things to do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| which would not normally be a consideration before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| except by rule we had to have those votes because we didn't have a month for it just to lay there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8246)|
| 2:17:33| and mature as it would normally mature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| So when they say whatever they said in thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8256)|
| 2:17:44| even if we spread it four ways or five ways, it still may be more than I would want to spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8264)|
| 2:17:53| There is one thing that we would lose in the translation would be that we are an intimate group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8273)|
| 2:18:01| in that Blount County may have way more members than we used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8281)|
| 2:18:10| So maybe a voting device would assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| The thing that I have not been doing, and I'm remiss for not exactly following the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8296)|
| 2:18:24| would be that before the vote is announced, you have sat and watched how your fellow commissioners have voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8304)|
| 2:18:35| and you may find that you're the odd person and that you should be asked a question since it's passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8315)|
| 2:18:42| since it's an issue that may be passing and you maybe not feel that your name should be associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8322)|
| 2:18:50| having a negative vote, I should have offered you the opportunity, does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8330)|
| 2:18:58| Whether you would have changed your vote or not, this system would not allow us to change your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8338)|
| 2:19:04| because as you press it, your vote is cast and will be called accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8344)|
| 2:19:10| Now, I'm saying that because I believe that's an item that's in our rules, that before the vote is announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8350)|
| 2:19:18| I do not see Commissioner Anders, but I believe that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8358)|
| 2:19:26| Okay, I believe he just agreed with me if it costs a dollar, he's not going to spend it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8366)|
| 2:19:38| I just kind of feel like we're in a good place right now, but we can continue wherever we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| Before you say you can't change your vote, look at how the systems are set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| The chairman at the end calls the regular vote and he can say, does anybody want to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8391)|
| 2:20:02| But would the people know what the votes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| Everybody would, they're up on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| And before it's the final cast that you go through, you can ask for the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| If somebody said I'd like to change my vote before the chairman ends the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| Well, you're really not up here to agree with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| You're up here to vote your own conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| That's what you were elected for, your brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| Not piggybacking on somebody else's necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| I move we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| We've got what we have to have before us as a resolution next month, articulating what it is we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8435)|
| 2:20:47| I see no further discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| Are there any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| I would like to remind everybody, because this is going to take place before our next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| is the Smoky Mountain Air Show, April 16th and 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| I'm sure a lot of you have gotten information from e-mails and such from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| But don't forget to tell all your constituents and everybody that's watching tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| It's absolutely free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Parking is the only thing you probably had a concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| But it's 16th and 17th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| And it's going to bring about a quarter million people over there on the weekend to the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| And I think it's a good thing for the tourist industry of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| Are there other items of announcement, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| Well, just in conjunction with that, and I forget the details of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| but I know the commercial service is going to be limited like five or ten minutes per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| So if you are flying out on those days, please, please check with Magee Tyson or your local carrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8502)|
| 2:21:50| because you will be delayed if you're flying out on those particular days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8510)|
| 2:21:57| Is there other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| Commissioner Broyles, our prayers are with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| If there be no objection, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| Zoning is in 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| Zoning will commence at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8534)|
| 2:22:19| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| I call this meeting of the Board of Zoning for the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8543)|
| 2:22:37| Madam Clerk, call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8557)|

| 2:22:47| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8567)|

| 2:22:49| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| All members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8579)|
| 2:23:09| As we look at this evening's zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| I would like to make an announcement here at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| that the last item on the agenda, 6F15RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| has been withdrawn by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| Didn't we decide last month he had to be here to say that, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| I know, but that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| We still have to vote on it, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| No, it's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| There's not a deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| It's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| That's a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| If there be no other whatevers to begin with, Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| you may read the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Request of dollar in yours, architect Brian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| yours for rezoning from RA low-density residential to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| at a density up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| Property located north side of North Ruggles Ferry Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| east side of Blake Lane, 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| This is 2-D-16-RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8658)|
| 2:24:26| I need you to give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| My name is Brian Ewers, 111 East Jackson Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| I have with me the owner of the property as well, Joey Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8675)|
| 2:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| Just a moment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| Thank you, Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| The property is a 3.7-acre tract located on the north side of North Ruggles Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8686)|
| 2:24:53| The Metropolitan Planning Commission voted 15-0 to recommend rezoning of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| to plan residential at a density of three units per acre rather than the five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8699)|
| 2:25:04| that was requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| The Commission felt that the three units per acre would be more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| There were some comments received from the public expressing concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| regarding the five units per acre density requested by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| but agreeing with the three units per acre proposed by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| Again, the vote was 15-0 by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| for the rezoning at a density of three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| We're in agreement with the reduction that the Planning Commission has proposed for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8740)|
| 2:25:51| I move that the application be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8751)|

| 2:29:24| The property is a 3.2-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| The Metropolitan Planning Commission is recommending approval of the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| of rezoning to planned residential at a density up to 5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| There were no public comments received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| It was approved on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8978)|
| 2:29:40| The Commission saw that the site has few environmental constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| and would be appropriate for development at the density of 5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8984)|
| 2:29:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| The community was aware of this rezoning, and as you could hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| there were no negative comments at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| and that's why it was put on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| So I would make a motion that we approve the PR Planned Residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| at a density up to 5 dwelling units per acre for 1525 Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9006)|

| 2:34:37| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| Kind of along those lines, it was my understanding you had a 20-minute presentation for us on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9279)|
| 2:34:46| but you've decided that you don't want to go forward with that and just go with our vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9286)|

| 2:34:59| and I've decided whether I wanted to do this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| and I think I'm going to recommend it for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160328?start=9302)|
