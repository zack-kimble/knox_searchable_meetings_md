| 0:00:00| This public hearing is for consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=0)|
| 0:00:07| amending the Knox County Charter to modify the appointment process of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=7)|
| 0:00:20| Do we have anyone in the audience that would like to speak on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=20)|
| 0:00:27| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=27)|
| 0:00:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Mr. Chairman, can we move right into voting on this, or do we have to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| We have to wait until 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| Well, seeing none, I guess the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| Mr. Chairman, can I speak to something over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| I just want us to be careful about an item of wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| I could have raised this at our later meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| You might as well give ourselves some time to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| If you look at the proposed amendment itself that is before us, if I'm not mistaken in my reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| it has honor before March 1, 1996, and honor before January 1 of each eight years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| I think the intent was to change the date of that because, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| if we pass it with those dates, we are passing immediately a new ordinance that's outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=77)|
| 0:01:25| What page are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| I'm looking at page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| I see it on D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| D, honor before March 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| If I'm not mistaken, that is the substitute language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Also, if I'm not mistaken, it would make the ordinance expire in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=95)|
| 0:01:43| So I think the intent was to change the years there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| It says every eight years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| And of January 1 of each eight years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| Each eight years thereafter would be each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| Each eighth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Mr. Law Director, would you like to answer his concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| I'm not quite sure I understand your interpretation of the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| Is each eight years thereafter meaning an eight-year cycle or just an eight-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| It seems to me the way that it's worded, it's an eight-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| If it's understood to be an eight-year cycle, then I suppose we don't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Is there anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| I heard Commissioner Davis' explanation and arguments for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| Are there any proponents on the commission here that could go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| and give me a two-minute snapshot of what this does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Or if not, could the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| I mean, I know this has been before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| but I don't have any great detail on what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| Are you up on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| You want to go, Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| My opinion of what she was, her intent is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| is that she had concerns in the process of the way the appointment process was going on for a charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| And instead of having a lump or a group of people being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| and we either had to vote them up or vote them down as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| that each appointee be voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| At least that's my interpretation individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So that if you had a problem with, say, one out of a group of nine or ten or 18 or however many it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| then you didn't have to vote the whole group down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| You could vote against that particular one that you had a concern about if you think they had a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| or any other reason that you felt like they would not make a good member of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| The other part of it was that her concern was that she felt like commission should have a say-so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| within who gets appointed as well instead of the mayor making all of the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| and then all we had a chance to do was either vote them up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| So she wanted commission to have a chance to, I think, do four on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=258)|
| 0:04:26| and then half of the remainder that the citizen part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| So that this body had at least some say-so within who would at least be up for nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| In addition to approving or not approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| And then we could approve or not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| And just because, say, a commissioner on this body supported someone to be appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| doesn't mean that a commissioner, when we voted on that particular person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| doesn't mean you would have to vote for them as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| You could still vote against them if you had a concern, even though that was a commission nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| And I think those, that was my interpretation of what she was trying to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| Before we had to lump them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| If a group up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| And vote them up or down, sort of like the charter amendments there, up or all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| And previously the mayor made some appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| What's the differential there in what the mayor's power or authority was previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| and what it would become in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| He appointed all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| Before he would appoint all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| He would even select which commissioners from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| And this lets the commission select the commissioners from whatever specific district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| No, I don't think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| Well, he appointed, in my situation in the first district, he asked me and I told him no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| Was that how it went?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| It went to the junior member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| I thought I was the first choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| I never denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| So that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| No, I was just, there was a lot of focus on this, it seems like, a few months back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| and then it faded away and it just sort of landed in our lap last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| and I just wanted to get a little background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Commissioner Shouse, just to kind of, I guess, give additional background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Commissioner Luthold is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| And as far as the commission goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| the commission took issue with having to vote the entire group up or the entire group down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| And that particular time we ended up not voting the group in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:52| So the initial impetus was to be able to pick and choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| Okay, we don't like John Doe because of this, but Jane Doe is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| So we'll go down each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| And I'm actually okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| But this, I think, does more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Commissioner Luthold's second point, I think, goes a little too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| I mean, he was accurate in telling you what this ordinance does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| and that is that we're now choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| We can put things on it any time that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Any time two-thirds of this body so chooses, we can put things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| What this does, and I think we'll end up having to vote on the commissioners that the mayor appoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=452)|
| 0:07:42| I think the mayor still chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| Because it says one-half, and I guess that's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| So is our half our commission or is our half half of the entire body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| If it's 28, do we get to pick 14 and the mayor picks 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| I'm not understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| I guess that's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| The way this is worded, what passed on first reading, is you've got a 19-member charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| and it says that the mayor will select half and commission will select half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| It doesn't differentiate between commission members and citizen members in any respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| Okay, it says, I'm just going to read this and I'm just asking for your interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| The charter review committee shall be composed of one member of the commission from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| and at least ten, but not less than a majority, comma, registered voters of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| who are not members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| That means what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Less than ten registered voters who are not members of commission on the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| But there's no upper limit to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| Not the way this is worded and was passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Because I think the last one, Craig, I don't know, you can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Did the last one have an upper number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| I thought there was a 28 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| 28 something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| It had a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| I think it was 28 or 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| So this one's gotten rid of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| I just have a lot of issues with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Yeah, I think there needed to be an upper limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| So, Commissioner Shouse, that's, you know, those are some of my kind of apprehensions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=576)|
| 0:09:47| Commissioner Brove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| The questions that I have are when there are other committees or commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| or committees or whatever put together, how is it normally done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| Is this far different from the way those things are normally handled or is it right in line with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Are you talking about the regular commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| Well, if appointment, if there is a committee that has to be appointed that consists of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| and the public or just the public, I mean, who does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Does the mayor do that and then we say yes, we agree, or we vote the whole thing down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| or do we have individual veto rights on each person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| I mean, I'm wondering how this is different from anything else that's out there that might be like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| where we have to appoint a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| I think the committee always comes from the, basically most committees come from the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and then the other committees come from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| So the mayor doesn't have the authority to appoint any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| I can't think of any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Well, there are boards out there that the mayor has certain appointment powers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| but we vote each of those up or down individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| This is the only thing that I can think of that comes that we have to vote the whole group up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| He has a lot of appointments on certain boards also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| And those you vote individually up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| You don't have to vote the whole group up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| That's one exception I can think of is we just voted in a slate on IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| But they could have been voted individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| That was the way that motion was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| Are you finished, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| There, in fact, is, if you read this, just beyond the comma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| not more than two such voters that would be the individuals to be resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| and registered voters in one commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| So that limits it to an additional 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| There is an upper limit with that language because you can have no more than two from any of the nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| I'm curious, background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| Has there been a problem with this, the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| the current appointment process on the Charter Review Commission in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| The last time it was proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Prior to that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| It was kind of a battle between the commission and the mayor at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Yeah, we had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| It was also the first time that a mayor had proposed more than just one citizen per district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| But all the other charter review committees only had one citizen per district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| except for the fifth district, it always had two since we were a larger district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| and that's what gave us the ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Not that it had to come from the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| I had a chance to serve on the Charter Review Committee in 1996 as a representative of the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| It's early and my mind is a bit feeble this morning, so bear with me here, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| Let's say that this passes and this comes before a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Would you go over point by point exactly how this would be structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| and exactly what our responsibilities would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Because I'm hearing a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| and there seems to be some real differentiation as to what numbers, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I'll put you on the spot at your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| If this passes as drafted without any changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| then it would be up to, and keeping in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| I think it was mentioned a little bit earlier that there have been discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| about amending what was passed on first reading in some respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=844)|
| 0:14:13| The way it's worded now is that commission picks half and the mayor picks half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=853)|
| 0:14:22| and they're voted on individually by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Each nominee would be voted on by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| Now, one person would be from commission from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| so nine members would be commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| The mayor would pick, are we saying ten or are we saying more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| The mayor would pick, no, that's not the way this is worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| It doesn't differentiate between which are selected by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| and which are selected by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| It just says that the mayor selects half and commission selects half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| But we don't have an upper number as to what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Well, the upper number is out of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| It's a minimum of ten citizen members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| a maximum of two citizen members per commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| See, I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Well, it seems to me that the way I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| you would have nine commissioners and then you would have ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| That's the way it has been done traditionally in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| and that is within the parameters of the charter provision that's in place today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| So if this passed, that would also be within the parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| because this gives a window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| It doesn't specify an exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| The window is nine commission members and a minimum of ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| because there has to be a majority of citizen members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| But there can be more than ten citizen members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| and the limit is two per commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| So the max would be 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| So you'd have 27 and then you get down to half and half, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| If you have a 27-member body, according to this and what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| half would be commission, half would be a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| No, appointees, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Half appointees, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Well, the way it's worded is that half of the total nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| before there's a vote would be selected by the mayor and half by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| Am I the only one who's kind of iffy on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| I mean, I understand the intent, but I think there's some details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| that I guess we'll iron out after nine o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Yes, I was going to respond to Commissioner Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| just a little bit of the history when we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Saunders, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| But to any extent, I was going to respond to Commissioner Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| a question about has there ever been a problem, you know, with this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| And what happened that morning where it was voted down is that we received the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| I think there were different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| You know, there was some questions about the mayor appointing the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| and who the people were, but one of the facts was that we received it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| and literally within minutes we were voting on it without really knowing who a lot of the people were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| And I think that's an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| It was still, if I recall, a very close vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| And I just consulted with Commissioner Lambert here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| and I believe that he and Commissioner Roundtree, who was sitting to my left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| from the vote because of some discussions that they had had regarding the appointment of the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| from their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| But, you know, that was the situation that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| And I don't know what the individual people, why they voted against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| but it was certainly a legitimate argument that we, it was literally passed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| and we voted with, that was a recollection of the reason why some people voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1094)|
| 0:18:21| It was still a close vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1101)|
| 0:18:21| I think it just failed by one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| And that was with two passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I think we go back to, in my mind, to have a more open government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| is that we don't allow one individual to pick nine commissioners and then ten citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| and one person has the power to name all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| I'm not saying at some point in time someone couldn't stack the deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| but it certainly could be possible to pick your friends, ten of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| to be on a charter review commission and then pick the commission and then you vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| And most of the time you're going to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| It's just, I think it's the way it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| I thought during some discussion last time, because, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| the way I understand this is that the mayor would pick half and we would pick half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| It certainly doesn't say what half we're going to be picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Does it say in there that the commission and the citizens are together as a total number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1165)|
| 0:19:37| Like if it's 19 members, ten citizens and nine commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| do we split that half and half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Well, that's what I think we need to be clear about so we all understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| because certainly whatever side you're going to be on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| there would be an argument at some point in time that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| I'm going to pick the citizens and the commission gets to pick the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| It's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| The way it's drafted is that the commission members will be limited to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| But who picks them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Well, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| All it specifies, the way it's currently worded, is that half of the total number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| whatever that's going to be, will be picked by this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| and half will be picked by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Unfortunately, it does not specify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| So what if the mayor came and says, I've got the names of so many citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| and all that's left is the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| So you all get to decide what commissioner wants to sit on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| is that how it would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Could somebody pick and choose what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| They could go ahead and get in front of the train and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| we've already picked these citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| We're going to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| So we've got nine commissioners left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Because I believe we had some discussion just last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| and I can't remember what day it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| that I thought we wanted to make it pretty simple so everyone would understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| I thought I made a motion that the commission would pick the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| one from each district, but voted on by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| And then we would pick half of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| and the administration, I mean the mayor, would pick half the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And that's the way it's spelled out specifically what everyone's role is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| and there shouldn't be an argument down the road if it's next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| or 15 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| It's clear right now it certainly could be a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| I was not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I have listened to the tape, and what was on the tape was that there was discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| I don't believe there was a motion and a second and a vote on what you just discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| It was just a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| There was discussion about the prospect of the mayor would select five of the commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1313)|
| 0:22:05| and the commission would select four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| There was not discussion that I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| or at least getting to the point of a proposal, about the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1333)|
| 0:22:21| Because I think based on this wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| it was assumed that half of the citizen members would be chosen by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| and half by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Okay, this is how I perceive things should go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| And this is just my own opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| That the commission as a commission would pick one person from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| to serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| And then the mayor would pick half the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| and the commission would pick half the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| But then that brings up the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| who gets to decide if it's going to be two citizens from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| or it's going to be one citizen from each district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Someone's going to have to decide the number of the makeup of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Now, who is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| As it's worded, that's left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| But ultimately, this commission is going to decide who serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| because this commission votes each nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| No matter who picks the nominees, the commission will vote them up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| And you've got to have a minimum of one commissioner from each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| and a minimum of ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| So it doesn't matter how many are nominated, that's your basement number is 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| And it can't exceed 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| I think we need to be very clear in everyone's mind before we vote also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| So, Mr. Law Director, how do you see that we should build this in that who gets to pick who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1441)|
| 0:24:12| and who gets to decide the total number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Well, I'm not trying to be too, what's the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1456)|
| 0:24:29| Help me, Chief Deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Where did he go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| He left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| If I understand what you're saying, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| I can word it so that it's clear whatever this body decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| It's just that at this point, I'm not sure what you want as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| You know, that's what you all need to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Now, my concern is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| I listened to the tapes of the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| and there was discussion about tightening this up along the lines of the discussion this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:09| and I think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| But the more changes that are made, the closer you get to taking this beyond this being a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:23| And it's my understanding that this is time sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| So if you make a lot of changes this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| you may get to the point where this is going to be a first reading as opposed to a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| Okay, Mr. Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| What's the time sensitive issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| To be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Of course, it has to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| So we're still in a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Are we in a meeting or are we still in the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| We're public hearing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| We're talking about the meeting at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| But I'm still, as Commissioner Hammond, I'm still pretty lost because I think this thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| there would be an argument at some point in time when somebody is not getting what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| And I think we ought to be perfectly clear so everyone knows the role they need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| that they're going to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| But I believe we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| I know at some point in time we had the conversation about the commission picking the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| and then splitting the rest half and half between the commission and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| But then the only other question I have is then say the commissioners asked someone to serve in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| and second district, but then the administration came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| and they had asked someone to serve as a citizen in the second district too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| and somebody has made a decision to have two per district citizens instead of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| So I don't know who makes that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1621)|
| 0:27:09| Neither do I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Well, that's something we probably definitely need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| While we're still in public hearing, Mr. Chairman, a member of the public, who we may recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| is standing at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| And if you don't mind, I'd like to ask her a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Elaine, thank you for authoring this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Let me ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Obviously this body, whatever it ends up being, is going to have nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Is your intent that those nine be selected by the commission itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| or nominated by the mayor and approved by the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| From what I understood from our public hearing from last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| that it seemed that both suggestions were offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| Obviously it's up to this commission as a body to determine which it would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| For me, I see either one being good solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| but as Commissioner Moore said, it does need to be clearly defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| so that way everyone can understand exactly how that selection process occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And as I understand the mathematics that's provided by the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| the citizen portion of this is going to be a minimum of ten, a maximum of 18 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| And presumably, was it your intent that half of those be nominated by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| and half of those by the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| And to address Commissioner Moore's concerns about if you have two nominations from the same district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| I would recommend that the mayor bring just a list of ten citizens, one from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1717)|
| 0:28:46| and then the commission have that same list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| And then that way, but the commission would ultimately determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| who was selected on that body and would vote those up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| And so you would have a choice of this person from this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| or this person from that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| And you would just make sure that the logistics matched up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| that you did have one person from each district represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I just want to get that legislative intent on the record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| I think it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| I think the one question, the one that was raised by Commissioner Moore is a valid one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| who selects the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| But the rest of it appears to be clear, ten to 18, half mayor, half commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| And we've got to make sure at the end that there are no more than two citizen representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| from any one district on that panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Well, if you limit it to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Can I hold you all for one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| We can start back the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| We need to start our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| And I'm finished, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| A motion to adjourn our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Ready for roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1802)|

| 0:30:34| I know this is a very important issue, but we have to be out of this room by 10 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| because we have a naturalization service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| Do you want to read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| What service we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| We can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Just read it to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| We won't be able to do it in an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| This is Ordinance 0-08-8-101, Consideration of an Ordinance of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| County, Tennessee, repealing Ordinance 0-084-101 and amending Article 9, Section 9.05 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1860)|
| 0:31:09| Knox County Charter to modify the appointment process of the Charter Review Committee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| to establish the deadline for submission of a charter amendment to the county election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| commission in accordance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| This is Ordinance 0-084-101 on May 27th, 2008, and Knox County Charter is adopted November 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1881)|
| 0:31:30| 1988 as amended through referendum of August 6th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| I don't have what Intergovernmental and Finance did, but does someone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| I'll make a motion to approve and get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Mr. Luther, I think your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| I think Commissioner Moore brings up some valid points, so does Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| and some of the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| I think if we go ahead and set the specific number instead of this could be between here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| and here, then we know exactly where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| What if we kept the commission at nine, one per district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and we set the citizens at ten with at least one per district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| and then the tenth could come from anywhere else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| That gives the citizens the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| But on the front end, we know it's going to be a 19-member committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| And in that way, you don't have some of the concerns that Commissioner Moore had with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| well, who decides how many bodies that the mayor is going to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| or the commission is going to pick because you don't know what the total number is going to be on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| So if we set the number on the front end at 19, then I think it solves that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| But I just wanted to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| And the law director, do you agree that if we were to just change the total number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| to where it would add up to 19, that would not be a substantial change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| and we could still consider this on second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| If what you just outlined is the only change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| then I think under the current state of the law, this would still be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| And I base that on a holding by the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| The phraseology that's used is whether or not the change materially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| or substantially changes the purpose and scope of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2032)|
| 0:34:01| Someone will make the argument that it changes the scope because of the fact that there could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| as it's presently worded, be more citizen members than 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| But as the courts have discussed it, I don't think that it's misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| That's really what the courts focus on is if you change it between the first and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| is it so substantial that it would mislead folks on what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| between the first reading and the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| And I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| So if the change that you just outlined is the only change, I think this could be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| I think what Commissioner Luthell is saying is drop the words at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| and just simply say composed of 10 registered voters of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| And that's the only wording change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| I just throw that out there as an idea to solve some of the concerns that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| And that's the way that all the other committees have been composed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| 10 citizens and nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| I may wander around just a second here trying to get a grasp of what it is I'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| I heard a key word mentioned a moment ago, that being legislative intent from Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:39| I also think back to the problem that brought this to the forefront, I think, was the petition issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2139)|
| 0:35:50| Back to legislative intent for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I think the framers of our charter want to make sure that if there are necessary changes to the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| that there be ways of initiating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And I view it as there are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| One is taking place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Signatures are being checked to make sure something can be placed on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| If we wanted to act today, well, maybe not today, but after a couple of other meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| we could place issues on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| And then there's a third way, which I viewed to be more of an annual review of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2189)|
| 0:36:37| that the mayor take it upon himself to say he's had enough input to say that we need to select a large body of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2197)|
| 0:36:47| to review the charter in whole or in general or in specific point to make changes to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| So what we've described or what I've described is three separate ways of getting things on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2215)|
| 0:37:04| us specifically, individuals in the public in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| or just in a general review of what needs to be done or changed on the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2229)|
| 0:37:16| And I kind of think that I'm leaning toward the charter's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| and that we don't need to search through these commas and ifs or ands that we have before us in one small paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2242)|
| 0:37:32| as being a thing that we need to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Or we can continue to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| but I think I'm beginning to lean toward the fact that specific things are in place to get specific things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2257)|
| 0:37:45| It doesn't matter which of the three ways we go in choosing of getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| It's still got to be the people at the ballot box that look at the issue that's been placed on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| and voted up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| So I have no problem with the way the charter's composed right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Two questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Does this approval by commission, is it simple majority or is it two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| I'm talking about the people that we're voting up or down or vetting on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| I would say that would be simple, majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And I'm also in favor of either making the number 18 or the nine commissioners and ten citizens 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| or 27, but not be so vague to where there could be 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| because then you obviously can't vote on half or you can't vote, you'd have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| So I think we need to be more specific in our numbers in our charter also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| I think we're making this a little more complicated than it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| And I like Mr. Leuthold's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| I would support that if he made it as a substitute motion or as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| But one thing that we need to keep in mind is the picks that really matter are the citizen picks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| If the mayor picks half of those and we pick half of those, we're going to get a diverse body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| Because the reality is, is that with all districts with the exception of the fifth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2355)|
| 0:39:23| it's going to be commission's pick anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Because let's say, for instance, we were having a charter review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| and Mr. Anders was chosen to be on it by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Since we're going to vote on these individually, if this passes, if Mr. Anders didn't win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| the mayor's only other option would be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| So ultimately that becomes a commission pick anyway, since we vote on these individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| So I think the only thing that really matters is that whether it's nine or ten or whatever number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2392)|
| 0:40:01| is that the citizen picks be picked partially by commission to balance this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| so that one person doesn't have too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Because ultimately the commissioners are going to be the commission's pick anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| Because if we don't approve someone, it automatically becomes the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| except in the fifth district where the mayor will have a choice between two that are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| And then, of course, if one is not vetted, then it comes back down to there's only one left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| So I think we're overcomplicating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I think if we just make it simply that the commission picks half of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| and then we vote on folks individually, I think we'll achieve what the authors have intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| Would we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Elaine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| I just wanted to say, do I need to give my name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Elaine Davis, 913 Station View Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| I just wanted to say that the Charter Review Committee is supposed to review the charter every eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| and that's the intent of having the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| It's not meant to be an annual review of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| And it was originally originated, the reason why they had the mayor do it by proclamation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| was that it was perfunctory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| It was not to allow the mayor to have a route to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| It was just an administrative responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| And so what our concern was, or what my concern was, with this past Charter Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| it was a way for the mayor to try to legislate, and that was my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| is that we need to make sure that we remember commission is the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| And the citizens were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| They did have the majority of people on that Charter Review Committee because it is their ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| and it is the spirit of what they bring forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| But we as commission are the ones that are responsible to make sure that we vet those ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| and make sure that they fit into how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| I think I'm agreeing with Commissioner Wright that I think it's fine the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| But if we do need to change it, I think it's way overcomplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| And I think, Craig, your suggestion was a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| except that it will come down to a battle over, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| who gets to appoint Districts 1 through 4 and who gets to appoint Districts 5 through 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| I mean, that's still not clear either in the way that that's worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So I was wondering if it might be more simple to just say the commission decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| who on commission wants to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| The mayor picks 10 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| The commission picks 10 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| And that way we've got the maximum number that we can have on the review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| The commissioners decide who they want among themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| The mayor gets to pick his half and the commission gets to pick their half of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| I'm not tied to the 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| That was just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| And I was just waiting to see what the rest of you thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| It just seems to me like that would be much simpler than trying to decide who's going to do which four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| or which five and, you know, you don't get into any battles like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| It's just pretty simple cut and dried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| I was just trying to say that if we set the number on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| and I was just using 10 as an example, then that clears up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| how many are citizens, how many of them are commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| and I was just trying to leave the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| That's a good idea, and I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Actually, I guess it would be nine from each district that the commission would pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| and nine from each district that the mayor would pick because we can only have two from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| So that would be nine commissioners and 18 citizens, half picked by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| half picked by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| They would definitely have the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| And those are the people whose ideas we want to hear from anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| Do you want to make that as an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Mr. Ivan Harmon, do you want to accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| Well, I need clarification because if your proposal is that the mayor picks all of the citizen members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2668)|
| 0:44:39| No, he picks only half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| He still is only picking half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Half of the citizen members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Are there going to be 10 citizen members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| No, there will be 18 citizen members, half picked by the commission, one from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| half picked by the mayor, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| And then the commission will also decide which commissioner from each district will serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| When the mayor makes his picks, are those going to be subject to an up or down vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| Yes, we leave that the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Still, I think that's what the commission felt was important was that we get to decide on each pick individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| I think that's the important part of this whole discussion here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| That's where I see that maybe the charter does need to be changed, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| is that I would like to be able to vote on each nominee individually instead of having to vote on them as a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| the way it is written now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| I think that's good, and I think doing it this way alleviates all the concern over who gets to pick how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| from what district and, you know, because that's going to be a nightmare trying to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| We will waste a lot of time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| So the total number is specified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| It would be 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Nine commissioners, two from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| I don't think that that is a substantial material change that would render this a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| as long as you keep in the provision that the commission votes up or down on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2766)|
| 0:46:13| Yes, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| I just think that that makes it a lot simpler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| and avoids any kind of confusion later on that we would waste a lot of time on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| I would accept that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Mark Harmon, do you accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Do you have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| I'll accept that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| And let me just think, I think the wording then becomes, just to clarify for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| and 18 registered voters of Knox County who are not members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| no more than two residents of the same district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| So I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| It fits in with that wording, and I do accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Well, instead of changing it from not more, just saying two from each district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| and then that just makes it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| Two, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| You know, and I'm looking at the math from this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| and really getting to Commissioner Wright's point, which I'm in violent agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| The commission, now this is the administrative arm of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| We've got the citizen process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| We've got the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Then we've got the administrative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| The administrative process now has two-thirds of the people coming from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| And in addition to that, we get to vote up or down on the remaining one-third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| Again, I really think that that is a fairly extreme balance of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2859)|
| 0:47:52| So, you know, but a more fundamental question, and this is probably to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| okay, with these new processes, who initiates a charter review process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2879)|
| 0:48:08| I know there's one every so often, but then there's a ways that we can, like the mayor did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Who does that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Well, this proposal that's before commission today deals with the eight-year cycle where the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| by proclamation, initiates a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| So the one that we had March, I guess it was, was that an eight-year cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| There was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| So I know that it's legal for the mayor, at least it was, for the mayor to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| we've got this group, one of these nine amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| I want to do a charter review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| So somehow the mayor started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| My question is, with this jumbling, can now we start a process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| Can the mayor start a process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| The commission can always start a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| No, the commission can just vote two-thirds and put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| So that's how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| But in this administrative process, can now we start a charter review committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| Because before it was a mayoral process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| Mr. Law Director, just in going up and looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| and researching this in the law department, as I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| there can always be, when the charter was originally written, there was a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| and I forget the exact phrase of what the charter group was actually called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| when it was originally the writers of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| That group can, you can even have that group done by either citizens asking for a referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| you can have the commission asking that that group be put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| or you can have the mayor by proclamation set that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| So the mayor still has a way to create a committee to review the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| Is that the charter review process or that's another committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| It's separate from the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| It's another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| And I forget, honestly, the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| So I guess the question, and I don't need an answer today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| but I definitely need an answer, who can start a charter review committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| The mayor does, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Yes, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Only the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| And the chairman can ask the mayor to start it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| would you please start by proclamation the charter review committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| The chairman of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| I'm thinking so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Because I believe that that's what occurred last time in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| is that we had the chairman ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| I believe that Commissioner Briggs had suggested that we have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| or he wanted to have an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| And then as a result of that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| it was a discussion that was brought before the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| And then the mayor prompted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| It was actually reversed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| is that we were going to do the ad hoc or task force afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| But my recollection is I'm trying to find it here in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| I have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Only the mayor can initiate the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| What we did was ask the mayor to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| But the mayor initiates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| To get back to what Sam said is that, see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| we really don't need to have a charter review committee because we can do it on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| And also my recollection of the charter is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| is that the mayor can ask for a charter review committee at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| but there has to be one convened at least every eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| My understanding is that what we're dealing with now is the makeup of the one that's convened every eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3111)|
| 0:51:57| No, this is any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| This is any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, when the mayor says I want to have a charter review committee, he can do that any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| But it has to be done every eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| And what we're dealing with here is when the mayor says we're going to have a charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| what that committee consists of and how it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| how it's nominated or how it's convened and what members are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| So before I give up the floor here, I'd like to, and hear me out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3140)|
| 0:52:29| I'd like to introduce a substitute motion that we repeal ordinance number 0-08-4-101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:45| and amending article 9, section 905,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| to say that the commission shall vote each of the charter review members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3170)|
| 0:53:01| nominees, one at a time or individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| And then the mayor will continue to pick all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| The mayor will pick them all, and we will vote each one up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| Do we have a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| I guess now we're, the discussion would be to the substitute motion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| Or are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Well, first of all, I'll speak against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| I think in this day and time in Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| we ought to have as many citizens on a panel that is going to change the face of this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| And not saying that someone would do this, but there still is a potential of the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3235)|
| 0:54:02| the mayor, picking everybody he wanted and getting this commission at least to vote a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3242)|
| 0:54:14| of the membership being able to pass something the mayor wanted passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| Not saying that would happen, but the potential is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| and this is something that's going to happen even when a lot of us are going to be gone in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| I think it's important just because we've seen there's people on both sides of the amendments right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| that's going to possibly be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| And, you know, that can be argued as we've done for the last several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| and some people support putting them on the ballot on the commission, some are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| If you had a mayor that picked a pro people who wanted to put them on the ballot off this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| and then he appointed ten citizens who wanted to put these on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| they're going to probably be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| And I think we need to pick citizens who a majority of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3302)|
| 0:55:10| but certainly I think Commissioner Burroughs has it right that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| let the commission pick so many, the administration gets to pick nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| the commission gets to pick their nine citizens from each district and nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| That's taking the power away from one individual and spreading it out over 20 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3327)|
| 0:55:36| And I think that's a good thing because there's no one on this board, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| that can control everyone on this board to get the pick they exactly want to make something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3342)|
| 0:55:50| So we're taking that away from someone and not saying that it's ever happened before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| or if it will ever happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| But the potential is there for it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| And I think, you know, that I think it just makes sense that if we can spread the number out to 20 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| getting to make the decision, it's the best for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| And I know there's some that's going to say, oh, the mayor, oh, he's got to be the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| But I think in this day and time, I think 20 people making a decision instead of one has got to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3376)|
| 0:56:25| And I'd like to say let's be mindful of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| We have to be out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Commissioner Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Yeah, just a couple of points I'd like to make very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| I know we're concerned about whether the commission has too much power or the mayor has too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| And this really isn't legislation that we're doing because the power ultimately, see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| we think that we're the people that are voting for this that are going to put it on the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| This puts it in front of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| And so ultimately, no matter who makes these appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| it's the voters that will have to accept this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| It's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| So the power is limited by the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So, you know, I don't know how important it is for us to get this exactly right on who's on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| or who's not because we're not legislating here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| We're just putting legislation in front of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I think one of the things that we've learned over the last few months is that wording does matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| because if indeed someone were to challenge this in court, it's my understanding, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| a judge, the only thing the judge would have to go by would be what is written in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| I mean, he would look at the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| He would look at it and make a determination as to whether or not the challenge to it met the muster of the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| So the wording in this charter amendment is extremely important for our citizens, A, to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| B, should it be challenged in court that a potential judge or jury, when they look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| they say, well, you know, it was, this is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| And if there is a challenge, the wording is going to be very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| It should be as precise as it can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| And there's been discussion here this morning about doing just that, trying to make it precise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| trying to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| But when you, the observations you just made are right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| We don't want it to be vague or ambiguous, because that invites argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| And the way it's written now, it seems to me that the vagueness that we've all discussed here this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| lends itself to that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| Having served on a charter review committee, if you're looking at 27 members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| in order to get anything passed on that charter review, it's going to take 14 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| So when you look at the makeup of it, you're looking at a pretty good broad spectrum of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| that are going to be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| And if you have to have 14 votes, nobody's going to have a, quote, coalition, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| just having served on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| The citizens take this pretty seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| So having 27 people with a 14-vote majority, I think, is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| I don't have a problem with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| I guess what I want to lock down is, I know that we have a substitute motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| but should it fail, we're looking at nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| We're looking at 18 citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Are we still looking at half being selected by the mayor possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| and possibly half by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Because if we are, that's not half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| That's 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| So you're looking at 26, and then there's one out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| I think that needs to be locked down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| And then on these nominations, are we saying, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| that nine would be commission nominations from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| And then, as I understand it, nine citizens would come, one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| And then mayoral nominations would be an additional nine, one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| So that gives us the 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Well, if you have nine commissioners, then the commission would nominate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| Half of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| One from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| One from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| And then the mayor would have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Half of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Half of the citizens, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| So nine, nine, nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| That gives us the 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| So no more of this nomination of half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| It's specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| It specifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| And the commission, just from what I've been able to gather watching this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| and now that I'm part of it, is that, you know, we can decide by a coin toss which one of us gets to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| on that committee or which one of it fits best into our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| I mean, I don't think there's going to be any, you know, oh, I want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| Oh, I want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| It's more like, have you got time to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| So I don't think that's going to be a big political problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| Not in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| So, Mr. Law Director, if we have that wording, again, I know we're on the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| but I'm just looking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| You don't see a problem if that language were in and that would not be a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| You're saying that as far as intent and purpose, it still meets the intent and purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| and we could go ahead and send it on to the election commission today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| I disagree with the substitute motion, and I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| I don't believe that the authors of our charter ever intended for the mayor to have a way to amend the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3689)|
| 1:01:39| I think that this annual charter review was intended to be a sort of a house cleaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| Let's review our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Let's just kind of check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| The mayor is an executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| He's not a legislator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| The only time we really have problems in any body is when a non-legislative body attempts to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| Now, the problem that we had that brought up to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| and Mr. Hammond, I certainly respect your experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| and what you've told us about the charter review committee that you were on, but I respectively disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3730)|
| 1:02:18| The charter review committee that you were on was a regular annual charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| Did you serve on an eight-year one, or was it the one back in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| This was the one where we had to clean up the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| But, I mean, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| It was a house cleaning type charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| What happened that brought us to where we're at is the mayor attempted to use his ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| to call a charter review committee to stack the deck with folks that agreed with him on these charter amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3767)|
| 1:02:58| that, of course, are ultimately being determined by petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| And so it was an attempt for the executive to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| And so in response to that, what commission decided to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| and this passed two readings, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| It was because of a faux pas in the law department, not the current law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| but the previous law department that caused this to be brought back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| But this was brought in response to saying, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| this mayor-anointed charter review committee was intended to be a housekeeping charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:40| not a legislative charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| I don't believe that that charter review committee was intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| that when the framers of our charter created the ability for the mayor to call a charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3827)|
| 1:03:57| I don't believe that it was intended that that be a way that the mayor effect changed to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| I believe that was intended to be a way that the mayor could clean up inaccuracies in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| Now, a charter review committee is the local equivalent of a constitutional convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| And I don't believe that one man should have the ability to stack the deck with folks with a certain frame of thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3856)|
| 1:04:25| when they create a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| And that's why I support the original motion and that's why I don't support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| We have 15 minutes and we have to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| I think I'd like to speak in favor of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| I think the way I feel is that it's a simple solution to part of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| that people are obviously concerned with balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| And so it gives a fairly clear and simple way to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| and add a little bit of strength to the commission without overdoing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| And so I'd be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| I think it's very ironic that we're spending so much time on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| and worrying about the mayor rigging something or stacking the deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| when we made U.S. history, I guess, for stacking the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| And so it just seems very strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| And some of the most strident comments are by those that were involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| So anyway, I'm going to support the substitute motion, Sam's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| If it fails, I think Dave Wright spoke very well of what we ought to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| and we should just go ahead and leave it as it is and vote against second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| And that's what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| I'd like to call for the question on the amendment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| I'll call for the question, starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| Can you repeat what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Cut off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Cut off debate and we'll start voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Commissioner Boyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Commissioner Lothold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Commissioner White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| Motion fails 11 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Just one quick to what Commissioner Lambert said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| That was not what the purpose of the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| It was exactly what he said it should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| It was an administrative action, if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| to clear up the legal language in the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| That's all it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| It wasn't to promote a certain amendment or not to promote a certain amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| We had a lot of questions about unintended consequences in the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| And the reason this commission asked the mayor to appoint a charter review committee was simply to get people together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| to clear up the legal languages to avoid ambiguities and unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Craig, I wish your daddy was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| So he could help us with some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I want to touch a little bit on what David Wright said, and I want to keep this quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| You know, guys, we are so hung up on this present administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| We just keep going back and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| I try to look at the big picture, and I'm looking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| We look at our map up there, and we all look at our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| Amy, I'm going to pick on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Let's say Amy is our county executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| She's our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| And she has run a countywide race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| And she's won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| I think what our forefathers had done, have set this up, is that I'm up in the north area with Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| and, yeah, we know who's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| But whoever has run as the mayor, has been elected mayor, they know a lot more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| And that's what they're looking at is to try to get the people that impress them when they ran their campaigns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| and who they think are really in touch with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| That's what I think has always been the setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| And we're still concentrating on, you know, this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| You know, this administration is gone, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| I mean, they know where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| You know, we keep trying to bash them and bash them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I'm looking at the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| I want to start off by saying that when I mention the mayor, I am not bashing the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| I am saying there is potential of these things that could happen to whoever is in the mayor's office if it's 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4148)|
| 1:09:17| I think that someone runs a countywide race as a mayor does, he knows certainly a lot of people, as Commissioner Smith says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| but we are the soldiers in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| We are the people who talk to our citizens probably more than an administrative mayor does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| So I think it's that we have a better grasp per district to know who's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4172)|
| 1:09:40| who wants to participate than maybe a mayor would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| But going back to one of the charter, Commissioner Larry Stevens was on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| and I think, I can't remember the citizen, but at the end of a charter review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| and I don't know if it was the last one or the next to the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| they got up and resigned and left the meeting because they tried at the last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| the day they were voting on it, people come in and was amending what they had agreed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| at the last meeting would be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| So there was an attempt by someone, I don't know who those people were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| I don't even remember the names of them, but they attempted to amend some things at the very last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| And I think Commissioner Stevens said, we've already settled this, and it was pushed on and pushed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| so I think he got up and resigned and I think the citizen from his district resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| So, I mean, I just think when you have 18 citizens and nine politicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| I think the citizens outweigh the politicians by far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| And that has to be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Mr. Chairman, if I turn off my light, would the question of the amendment be on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| We'd be ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| Seeing no other lights, we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| And I'm sure we divided it, so I guess we need to have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Would you repeat the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| To repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| It's basically to keep the ordinance as it is, with one exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| that this body votes on each individual appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| And, Mr. Law Director, would that make this a first or second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| It would just no longer be half commission, half mayor or appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| It would just be all mayor or appointee, but we vote on every person, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4301)|
| 1:11:48| I think it's already in there individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| No, that was the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Well, it was in the proposed ordinance first reading that it would be voted up or down by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| We're just going to delete the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| The change that the substitute motion makes is that the mayor makes, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4326)|
| 1:12:15| nominates all members, and then the commission votes up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| Because that's what the Commissioner Lutho's father and the other crafters initially said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| Well, so in terms of how the Charter Review Committee would be constituted, it would remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4347)|
| 1:12:39| The same process would exist that's in the original charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| The only difference is once the mayor comes with his 21, 18, 28 people, we will vote on them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| 19 to 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| 19 to 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| One clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Well, to answer your question, it's a close call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| To give you my best educated guess today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| if you keep in the provision that this commission has the final say on each individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4389)|
| 1:13:18| I really think that is the real intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| So I can't say you're on safe ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| but I would suggest going forward with that if that's going to be the only change from the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4410)|
| 1:13:38| If there's any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| That's my only change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| So the only change of the first reading is to eliminate the part where the mayor picks half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| and the commission picks half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Really, the effect of the substitute amendment is that the only change that's going to be made to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| is that the nominees will be voted up or down by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Individually, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| So I understand Mr. McKenzie's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| That's the substitute motion to Commissioner Brawle's motion, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| not the document we were handed this morning, but to her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Is that what we'll be voting on if the substitute fails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Then we'll go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Is that Commissioner Brawle's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Commissioner Brawle just had an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Okay, then that's her, this document and her amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Commissioner Brawle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Commissioner Ivan Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| We're voting on a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| I voted no on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| The motion fails 14-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Now we're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Would you explain the original motion as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| The amendment was that the mayor picks 10, we pick 10, and we pick 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4539)|
| 1:15:49| No, 9 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| 9 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I'm sorry, 9 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| And the commission picks the 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| So nine commissioners would be picked by commission or nominated by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Nine citizens would be nominated by commission, one per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| The mayor would nominate nine citizens, one per district, for a total of 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| And is there anything else that would basically supersede the half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| And then the commission will vote on each of those nominees individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Which is already in the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I will be voting in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| And that would, as I understand, you've got those 27 nominees, but then when it comes to the up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4583)|
| 1:16:34| and down vote, you know, some may make it, some may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| But there has to be the minimums?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| Or is it going to be, you know, are there going to be 27 no matter what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| And if some don't make it, then there's going to be new nominees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| My proposal or my suggestion would be that we have 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| That's the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| And if some don't make it, we come back with other nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| We have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| So that means that county commission is picking all the members that are going to be on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| The mayor picks nine, but we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| The commission picks all 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| No, the mayor picks nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| We pick nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| No, as I heard it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| We have to vote on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Commission picks all of them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Would it be possible to do this where the mayor picks nine, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| We pick nine, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| We decide among ourselves who's going to serve and then we vote the whole thing up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| so that it doesn't appear that the commission is handpicking every single person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| Because I understand the concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| That's not on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| That's not on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| the people who's going to vote on this are going to say we're picking all 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| which is a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Because we're going to pick nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| We're going to pick nine citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| And the mayor is going to pick nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| If the mayor's people doesn't make it, he's going to get to nominate somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| So he's going to get nine picks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| The commission is going to get nine picks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| And no matter what anybody on this commission wants people to believe and vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| the administration gets nine picks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Now, come on, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| We can vote down every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| And they can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| And I'm sure that they're not going to get voted down every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| As you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| Because I know there's three of them here that will support the mayor, maybe four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| So he's got a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| I think that Larry makes a good point that we need to be looking forward instead of focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| on whatever shortcomings or not this particular administration has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| I mean, what are the chances really that this entire body is going to agree to vote down every single one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| mayors or even one of the mayors pick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| I doubt that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| I mean, we can't decide ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| So I don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| I think everyone has their minds made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| And we have zero minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| I'm ready to vote if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| But I was going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| We're using this appointment process as trying to say that we're picking these people which aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| In the charter that we are to make these appointments, that's not picking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| Because the mayor picks a lot of people that we don't have any say so who he brings down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| But all we do is approve appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And that's different than picking the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| Starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4794)|

| 1:19:56| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4798)|

| 1:20:02| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4825)|
| 1:20:33| Motion passes 13-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I've got two things to bring before the body before we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| The first thing, the picking of the judge is on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| We have to move that up to one o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| I know most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| It was originally four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| We cannot get any room in this building except for that time between 1 and 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| So on the 18th, it will be at one o'clock, the hearing, not the pick of the judges, but the public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4857)|
| 1:21:05| and them to bring their case to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| The other thing, Todd Napier wants to do a workshop with us sometime in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4868)|
| 1:21:17| I will send this out, have Jody send it out, and maybe I'll put it on the message board the different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4877)|
| 1:21:23| He would like to do it after agenda meeting or finance or intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| So you can be thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| That discussion of tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Discussion of tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| I think after the intergovernmental would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Maybe I'll check with Todd and see if he can do two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| We'll have to intergovernmental and finance will be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| Also, Mr. Chairman, after the finance and intergovernmental this month, we're having training sessions, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| Yes, we're having training sessions on our computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| I think you probably need to bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| The training sessions are going to be in the classroom on laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| I mean on desktops, not on our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| You don't have to bring it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| You don't have to bring your computer to the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| They have so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Is that correct, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| Anything else from the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| I have to move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| All in favor, get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| The ones that don't, stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080905specialhearing?start=4950)|
