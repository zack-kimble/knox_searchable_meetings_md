| 0:02:00| really high heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=120)|

| 0:20:06| So we do flatbread pizzas and gourmet paninis and sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1206)|

| 0:20:45| It would be 60 to 90 days. Okay, so I'm going to suggest that we defer this to October 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1245)|
| 0:20:57| Okay. It would be 60 days. Okay. All right, do I hear a motion? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1257)|

| 0:21:21| Are they ready? They must be ready. Sunday Tell, address 247 Indycar Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| Okay, and you need the health, building, and fire inspections. How far are you, or how close are you to getting those done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| I'm getting pretty close, but it's just a lot of stuff you've got to go through, dealing with contractors and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1295)|
| 0:21:44| All right, do you need a 30 or 60 day deferment? 60. All right. Do I hear a motion to defer to September 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| So moved. Second. All those in favor? 60. 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| I'm sorry, October 25th. All right, you're welcome. Thanks. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| All right, now we have two hearings. The first is the Kabuki Restaurant on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| All right, thank you. You were cited for sale to a miner on March 17th, 2015, then again a year later on April 22nd, 2016, and then again in July 26th, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| These are three citations that you've received in less than two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| I think I only got two. I only got two. You're looking at Bravo Kuchina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1347)|
| 0:22:37| Okay. Okay, which ones have been cited twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1357)|
| 0:22:57| Okay, so I'm sorry, two times instead of three. Let's don't make it three, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| All right, you have submitted a plan, and you're going to have a mobile app. Do all the servers have the mobile app to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| Yeah, anybody can download the mobile apps. Once you sign in, they can tell you your age and address, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| Even a fake ID, you can check out as a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| All right, so we do require these. Are you providing additional training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| Okay. We can do one of two things. We can accept this and take no further action, or we can send them to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| What would be the will of this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| I'm not seeing that real quick. With the most recent violation, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| I think the server, she miscalculated the date of our birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| So she saw the date on the card but thought it was 21 and it was not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| Yes. And the mobile app will solve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| The right number of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Now, if we use the mobile app, it will show your age and even a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| All right, so what was the will of the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| All right, thank you. We hope your business is successful, but please do not come before this beer board again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| We need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| It is Joe Isbell, and it's 106 Major Reynolds Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| This is extremely serious in the eyes of this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1504)|
| 0:25:22| I understand that you have terminated the employees who served. You've also put some other plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| Does each server at Bravo have an ID reader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| No, not each server. We've just recently, after the third offense, bought readers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| They're scanners that do accept swipe license and barcode license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| I tested it and took a picture myself today, but they've only been in place about 10 days since the third violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| So they are in the building, about $1,000 apiece that we've just put in in the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| All right, so tell me, I come into your restaurant and I look like I'm under 40, and so no comments, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| I look like I'm under 40, so how do you go about checking my ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| They will ask you for your ID only if you order an alcoholic beverage and run it through the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| Where is it physically located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Right by the terminals, two POS terminals in the dining room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Is there one in the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Mr. Frost, what are the options that we have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Well, there are two options. First, accept their remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| But honestly, they've had three violations in less than a two-year rolling period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| So whether or not the beer board sends them on, the law department is going to be filing a noncompliance complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1612)|
| 0:27:02| So there is some discretion, but the law department will be taking action shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1622)|
| 0:27:11| So I hear those two options, but what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| We can send them to the administrative hearing and that will include the complaint and it will go before the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| And I think it would be a shame if this board didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| I don't think we need to leave it up to the administration to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| That's a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you. Yeah, I guess I was confused because I thought with three violations it was automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| It is. I talked to the law department this morning. They're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| But it has to come here anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| It is automatic for us to send it on the third violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| That's what I thought. Doesn't our code say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Yes, it does. And I guess the law department is getting a head start anticipating that we would be sending it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| All right. How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Okay. So you understand that we, according to our ordinance, you have to go before the administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| And that officer will get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| The city law department will contact you with a notice of noncompliance with a formal complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| And then you will go to the hearing officer and they will contact you with all those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Has TABC contacted you for action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| No, they have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| We have gone through additional training with a company called Top Shelf as well, two times this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| to give additional carting training to our staff, as well as hired starting September, starting next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| a separate company to do kind of like a secret shoppers for carting guests that come into the restaurant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1730)|
| 0:28:59| But we have not been contacted by the TABC, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| Okay. That's surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Councilman De La Botte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Yeah, I was just wondering, do you have any kind of a sign on the front door as you enter saying that all persons will be carted before a beverage is served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1746)|
| 0:29:15| I mean, an alcoholic beverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I don't believe we do. I don't want to – I can't be for sure that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| I've seen that in several restaurants, that they have like store policy, no alcohol without proof of age kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| You might think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| You need to reinforce what's happening inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| And I know sometimes servers are busy and they just say, well, everyone looks old enough, and they start getting going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| But that's going to get you in trouble and cause you to lose your license if you're not careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| And I'm going to look into those signs for sure, but I can tell you two of those three times the individuals were carted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| which allowed us to get the scanners because they're not adding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Look at the ID, look at the individual, and don't even register that 1996 was too young to serve alcohol to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| We have a math deficiency in our schools in addition to everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Well, sir, as I said, the law department will be contacting you to take this to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| Even though you have done some of the things you're supposed to by ordinance on the third violation within two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| we have to send you to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| And you've had three violations in less than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| So we would hope that no more occur and the law department will be in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| We need to vote on sending this to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| I think we've had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I don't believe we have any more business tonight, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160816?start=1845)|
