| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| I call to order this public hearing for the purpose of discussing ordinance 0-17-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=30)|
| 0:00:57| We would like to start this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=57)|
| 0:00:59| Can we do a presentation from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Give a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Or Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| Dan Kelly, MPC Deputy Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| Jeff Archer is here this evening, and I believe you heard from him previously on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=73)|
| 0:01:21| We are prepared to make a presentation, or what's the pleasure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| Presentation would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| I'll give a little bit of an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Jeff Archer, Principal Planner with Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| The ordinance was a lot of work where we reached out to city staff, county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=103)|
| 0:01:53| We did an ordinance for the city and the county, and we wanted to make them parallel as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| The current ordinance that's on the books right now is very outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| It was done in 2002, and you could think of how each individual has used your cellular phones totally differently than what was available in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=125)|
| 0:02:19| So the equipment has changed as far as the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=139)|
| 0:02:28| When the ordinance was developed, we were looking at technology that was on 2G, which was phone, which was just phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=148)|
| 0:02:40| It wasn't data, and so now we're really using data, and the consumption is really heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| So the old paradigm as far as looking at the ordinance was looking at total just coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=166)|
| 0:02:55| and now it's also addressing capacity because so many more things are using the Internet, not only your phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=175)|
| 0:03:04| but future generations as far as the old Internet of Things, what you're using, coming with the autonomous cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=184)|
| 0:03:15| There's a lot of changes that are coming down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| We did highlight a couple things as far as the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| The old ordinance was very basic, and the design standards were in a wireless communications facilities plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=205)|
| 0:03:37| Its intent was written more as a guideline, but over time it's been interpreted more as a regulating plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=217)|
| 0:03:50| One of the issues with the current ordinance is it has priority areas based on what I call character areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=230)|
| 0:04:01| So it may refer to as woodland or pasture land or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| and that could be interpreted a lot differently depending on whose definition you use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| So we wanted to make this new ordinance zone-based, and it sets a priority as far as the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| So if you think of the more intense zones as far as industrial and commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| it's set up to allow an administrative, because that's where we see an administrative approach as far as approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=266)|
| 0:04:38| and things that are where we don't want them to locate or least preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=278)|
| 0:04:47| like our residential areas, our historic areas, our scenic corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| So those are leased, and they would have to go through, if somebody was proposing a new tower in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| they would actually go through a process that goes to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| and they would have to prove why they couldn't locate a new tower in, for example, an industrial area or commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=307)|
| 0:05:18| So I don't want to go into too much detail because it kind of bogs down a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=318)|
| 0:05:27| but I'm more than happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Jeff, this is the same presentation that you gave at the O'Connor Senior Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| and I believe Commissioner Schoonmaker, Mr. Smith, was there another one there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| No, it was just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I think we were there, and I thought it was a great presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| and I took it to my homeowners group and told them, and they were all aboard with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| Larger towers in industrial sites, they could be the bird cages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| and we had the monopoles in the neighborhoods at shorter distances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| and there was concern last month about, well, I need to be 200 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| but they can do that by an application, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| They just got to prove that they need that 200-foot height instead of that 150 regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| So everything that I've seen at that meeting and what our homeowners group said, we're for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| and I think it's a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Anything can be tweaked, but I really like the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| The good part is now the county will have the maximum limit of 200 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| because currently we did not have a height restriction on the monopole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| The questions I have are more towards the distributed antenna systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| or the ones that are going to be the 38-foot tall height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| and of course people in the industry, as I've mentioned to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| have said that with the rollout of the 5G, what cell structures you have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| we will have ten times as many as we currently have, and I think that's been pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| Everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| The whole idea is we want to be out front with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| so citizens understand that with technology changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| there's going to be some things going on in your neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| and on the commercial corridors that you're not used to seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| My question is for neighborhoods that have underground utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| obviously there's no light pole there that if it was in KUB's jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| they could co-locate a cell structure on or a distributed antenna system on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| Who has jurisdiction if they have to install the 38-foot tower in a residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=476)|
| 0:08:05| with underground utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| Does that fall under engineering and public works jurisdiction or under MPCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| It really depends on where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| I think what you're referring to is in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| That would go through the county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| I was talking to Dwight, I didn't get to see it, but they've tweaked their guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| That's not addressed through the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| To the city and Knox County's credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| I think we made a smart decision to have that go through engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| because it's in the right-of-way, and that's more like a utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| So if things are on the parcel, it goes through here on private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| If it's in the right-of-way, it goes through city or county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| They have finished that process, their guidelines, as far as you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| As far as I know, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| And they're shaking their heads yes in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Sir, the BDAC was supposed to meet November 9th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| to give a rollout plan for the 5G technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| Do you know the outcome of that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| One of the things that is really you have to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| as far as 5G is just a generic term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| So each provider is going to have their own version of 5G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| and then there's things that they're doing with 4G and LTE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| and they're all kind of trying to define what 5G is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=581)|
| 0:09:50| Usually the way it works, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| and the way it happened with 4G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| is whoever basically rolls out a network first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| that becomes more the industry kind of pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| as far as how they use the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Also, there is some concerns with this newer technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| and these lower heights and closer distance of radio frequency exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| Has anybody looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| That's something that's controlled at the federal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| and unfortunately a city or county doesn't have control over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| as far as any kind of radio frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| If they're approved through the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| then that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because I'd like to speak to that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| especially when you look at high-density areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| and the historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Could you touch on that to look at the concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Obviously, the impact of the number of those poles are going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| Right, and if you look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| and actually you're probably familiar with the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| If you start to look at some of the buildings in denser areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| they actually do it through antennas on top of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| when there's structural height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| The way the ordinance is set up, it has a priority order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| So a new tower, even if it's in a less dense area, is the least preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| But it's just a matter of trying to accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| By the federal government, we have to accommodate them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| but how can we best accommodate them into the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| For example, the antennas that are on top of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| we have standards as far as trying to get them to camouflage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| as far as fitting into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| We also have, if you're going to put them on a rooftop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| to actually locate them towards the center of the roof rather than the edges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| and so that gets them out of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| So there's, in the most dense areas where you have building height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| the providers and the way the ordinance is set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| are going to want to do antennas on top of structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| rather than the standalone tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| This is one of those things that I look at as a federal pushdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| These are being pushed down upon us, these regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| and how the processes we're going to go through to install these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Does this ordinance, in your opinion, maximize protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| for the citizens of Knox County and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| while at the same time not fringe upon being overridden by the Fed Regs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| The one thing I think is really good, and we studied some ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| and the model that we looked at was Spokane, Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| They went through a long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| and in a way they have this totally different area of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| but kind of similar terrain and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| But the more successful ordinances set a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So like I talked about as far as the office or the industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| that would be more preferred than a residential or historic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| You can go into a residential or historic area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| but you're going to have to jump through a couple more loops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| So you're going to have to prove to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| that there weren't any other sites available in your service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| For example, you would have to prove that there weren't any tall structures available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| You would have to prove that there aren't any existing towers that can accommodate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| You would actually have to prove at least five other sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| as far as if there's commercial or industrial or office in your service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=835)|
| 0:14:03| why you couldn't locate on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| So what it would be would be residential was truly, truly the last way of accommodating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| And I think I got from our last meeting that we are contracting that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| to help us with the burden of proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| We're not relying on the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Yes, we have the way it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| We have a consultant on board that helps with the review of applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| and the way it would go forward is we foresee still the use of consulting services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| to assist MPC staff on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Does that consulting services have any ties to the cellular industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| where they might have conflicts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| They're independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| What would be the time frame from the start of the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| to the actual antenna being put up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| What length of time would we be looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| So it depends on what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| So the quickest would be if somebody is locating the antenna on a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| that could be approved administratively the way it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| If they meet the criteria, the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| and they're co-locating an existing tower, that could go right ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| and that's administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| If they're going into a new tower that meets all the design standards in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| industrial, and commercial, that could go smoothly and quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| But if they're locating in residential, historic, or within a scenic corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| then that would go to an MPC public meeting, which just adds to the length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=955)|
| 0:16:05| It would be a public meeting where the community can weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| and the burden of proof is on the applicant to show that they couldn't locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| in those more preferred areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| What's the time frame that we are given to have something either approved or denied by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| It's 60 or 90 days, depending on what is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| There is a shot clock, and the way the ordinance is done, it follows those federal rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=995)|
| 0:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| Commissioner Bussle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| As of right now, this new technology that's coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| has there been a study that shows that there are certain places that you could locate these towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| or these communication pieces and say, okay, this would be a good area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| this would be a good area, this would be a good area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| which would get your maximum cover without the least conflict with the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| Have you done those types of studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| and have you shown those areas where those towers could be placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| No, it's not really set up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| It's a market decision, and that changes over time as far as, like I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| it used to be about just coverage, but now it's capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| So what you're seeing, what Commissioner Schoonmaker was talking about as far as the small cell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| they're going to want to be on the Kingston Pikes, the broad ways, the major arterials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| because those are high-use areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| There's denser development, and they're going to want to locate there as far as the small cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| So we didn't look as far as where, that's like the industry is basically telling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1084)|
| 0:18:14| is communicating where they want to locate based on the usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| So it's not, I don't think it's our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| And if it was, if we looked at it, it would be outdated very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| because the usage patterns change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| It's not a static analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| It changes over time depending on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| This is just a suggestion that because Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| has a separate set of guidelines regarding the small cell towers, once this is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| I think it would be a good opportunity, maybe the first of the year for that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| to come and give us a presentation on what is going to affect the residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| Because they have some wording like we would assume a new tower would go up would be a steel pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| They have restrictions that say you could use a wood pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Because we're the ones that are going to get the phone calls from the residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| I think it would be ideal to have Engineering give us a seminar on their rules for small cell structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1161)|
| 0:19:31| Good point, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you guys for your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| Anything else that needs to be discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171113PublicHearingc?start=1189)|
