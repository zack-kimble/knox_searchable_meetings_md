| 0:00:00| Okay, I'll call the October 4th, 2007 workshop on the 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=0)|
| 0:00:10| Clark, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=10)|
| 0:00:16| Consideration of the process for Knox County Charter Section 2.02H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=16)|
| 0:00:21| Okay, I don't know who needs to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=21)|
| 0:00:24| Maybe Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=28)|
| 0:00:32| Okay, I haven't done a whole lot of work on this lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=32)|
| 0:00:39| Mary Ann said yesterday she spent the last eight months working pretty exclusively on a certain group of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=39)|
| 0:00:52| And she said, you know, at least if I had been pregnant, I'd have had something to show for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=52)|
| 0:01:07| Yeah, we would have taken a miracle for that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| In any event, we're going to talk about our cases at the committee meetings on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=72)|
| 0:01:30| We expect the judgment tomorrow, and we'll see what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=90)|
| 0:01:37| As far as the 202H investigation, the little bit of time that I've had to spend with it, I have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=97)|
| 0:01:50| You won't speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| No, no. Just make sure people can see when I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| That's okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| I've had a law clerk look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| We've spent some time finding a process that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| Because right now, what we have is a provision in our charter, 202H, without a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| We don't have a process. We don't have rules that apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| There is a procedure that's used in the U.S. Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| They've been through one or two hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| And their procedure seems to work pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| I'm not saying that we adopt the U.S. Senate procedure for our 202H provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| but something akin to that would certainly be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| There are a number of due process considerations that need to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=161)|
| 0:02:51| When I start going through the Senate provisions, there are grants of immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=171)|
| 0:03:04| There is contempt powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| There is provisions where you can take sworn and unsworn statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| There are provisions that discuss the number of privileges that may be asserted during such hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=193)|
| 0:03:25| And that goes from the First Amendment to the Fifth to the Fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| There are attorney-client and work-product privileges that are taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| when someone appears as a witness and is represented by counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| There are certain restrictions on attorney involvement in such hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| It's quite an elaborate procedure, at least in the U.S. Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| And like I say, I'm not saying that we should adopt their procedures, certainly verbatim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| but we need something that provides due process, that provides a fair process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| And we have a subpoena power. We need to decide how that's going to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| So our commission needs to adopt a procedure, and we need to adopt rules for this provision in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=251)|
| 0:04:23| And as we sit here tonight, we've done neither of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| We've never invoked this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| So from a legal standpoint, we're not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| We're going to need some more time to bring you a procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=279)|
| 0:04:47| and to bring you some rules that we can discuss at a meeting and that you can vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| in order to conduct a 202-H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| There's much more to it than calling a few folks to the mic and asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=301)|
| 0:05:09| There's much more to it than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| If you're going to do it the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| persons have certain constitutional rights they may wish to invoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| We need to make sure everybody is clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| And we need to have provisions that deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| So tonight, that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| We need a little bit more time before we dig any deeper into a 202-H investigation by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=330)|
| 0:05:41| Okay. Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| This is a workshop, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| We can call a workshop without having a meeting. Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| Well, you can call a meeting roughly with 48 hours' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| We look for three days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| This is not a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| Obviously, the media heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| Yes, you can call a workshop on pretty short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| I'd make a suggestion that we let the law director, and I know he's been busy, he's been head over heels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| go do what he needs to do and then maybe get in touch with you when he gets some things outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| I don't know if he can call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| I think we can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| And then reschedule some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Well, let's see if we've got some questions because there may be some ideas that people have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Commissioner Leuthold, that the law director might want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| John, as you come through this, something that you might want to think about is who's going to preside over this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| Is it going to be the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Or is it possible that we could have someone else preside over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| maybe even someone outside this commission preside over it, a judge or someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| In the U.S. Senate, how it works is the chair of the committee presides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| And it's usually a committee procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| It's not a full U.S. Senate investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| It's broken up in committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| So that's one question is whether or not we're going to make it a full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| or are we going to subdivide into a committee to do something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| And then who presides over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Our charter provision allows you to certainly conduct hearings as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| or you can assign it to a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Yes, it allows for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| It's another one of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| And whoever it is that is the chair, like I say, of any Senate committee is the presiding official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| But we could go with one of our two committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| or we could just leave it as the entire commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| or we could just make up an entire new committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| It's still pretty wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| The charter provision provides that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| and its authorized committee shall have full authority and power to hold public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| John, is there any precedent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| You talk about this is at the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=497)|
| 0:08:19| You're calling on ideas from the federal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| There is no precedent on the state level for this type of investigation from a local legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| I don't know of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Certainly, they're welcome to enlighten me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| We have this provision in our charter and it allows for a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| One, you can have a hearing for the purpose of gathering information, necessary or desirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=520)|
| 0:08:49| for the purpose of considering proposed commission legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| And in the U.S. Senate, a lot of it involves legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| As far as you know, that's not been done in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Well, as far as I know tonight, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| The other provision in our charter provides that the commission may investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| any allegation of violations of this charter ordinances or emergency ordinances of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| And there's only two charter form of governments in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Yeah, and I haven't talked with Brian Coon, the Shelby County attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| to see if they have a provision like this or if they've ever invoked it, but I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| I wonder if our state legislature deals with any investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=579)|
| 0:09:48| You really never hear of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Budget, certainly, you would have issues dealing with budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| but you don't really ever hear about investigations on a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| I would imagine they have a procedure, but I don't ever hear about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| When we're talking about procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| the service of subpoena is you'd follow the Tennessee rules of civil procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| That's one of those things that we would need to talk about, but, yes, that would be a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| And if we go to have an administrative judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| we would need to present those names in the commission vote if we go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=625)|
| 0:10:34| So setting up the procedure, first on the service of process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| that's Tennessee rules of civil procedure we follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| One of the only other real questions, isn't it, would be how this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| who's going to chair it, and the questions come from the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| The answers that we receive, the information that we gather, then goes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=658)|
| 0:11:05| Is that correct or does this commission make a decision as to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| That right there is just a piece of the U.S. Senate process and procedure that deals with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| It's very, very involved and much, much more complicated than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| There are a number of decisions that need to be made about the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| It's more than just whether we apply Tennessee rules of civil procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| and it's more than, well, do we bring in an administrative law judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| We need to set up a process for that and how you go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| Set up a process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| You just want to call somebody up on the phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| No, we need to vote on it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| You bring applications in or you bring people in, you go over their resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| The commissioners may want to have an opportunity to ask questions of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| It's one of those things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| It's another one of those things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| This is not the way the U.S. Senate does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| We're not the U.S. Senate, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| They allow their chair to do it, and we certainly have chairs of committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| And the chairs, you know, whenever there's an investigation in the U.S. Senate, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| the chair might make somewhat of an opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| This is why we're here, and this is what we're looking at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| You know, we welcome so-and-so here, and they either do or they do not have their counsel with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| And you may not even swear them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| It may not even be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| It may be one of those occasions where you wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| But then it proceeds in an orderly way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| That's what I'm looking at is trying to come up with something that provides due process and fairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| and gets the job accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| So what would be the first three steps that you would want to leave us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| Step one, give me more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Step two, give me more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| And step three, give me more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| I'm not trying to be facetious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| I haven't had enough time to go through the process yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| It's not as simple as you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| We don't want to do it in a way that it's haphazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| or that it doesn't provide the right kind of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| We just don't want to even attempt it without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Do we ask for discovery or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Would that be a part of the process, turning over the records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| It can be, certainly, and that's part of the Senate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| It is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| That may be one of those things you want to look at first as a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| or as a commission before you call anyone as a witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| That's part of their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Mr. Law Director, I applaud your comments about let's get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| We have seen what happens when we try to do things in a hurried fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| by going through the process and making sure that we have all of our I's dot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| and T's crossed I think is a very good suggestion on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| I guess I do have an obvious question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| The Chancellor will be making his ruling tomorrow at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| and you had mentioned that you'll be meeting with us on the 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| or at our committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| As I understand the open meetings law, it's possible we may need to meet before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| Do you feel, depending on what the ruling is tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| that we might need to have some type of workshop or some type of thing before the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| I've thought about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| and I actually thought about having a meeting before our workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| or before our committee meetings next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| But ultimately, whatever the judgment is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| we will have some time to work through the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Some judgments aren't effective for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| I don't anticipate this one will be any different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| So we will have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| We'll have the 15th, and we'll have the 22nd of this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| to do anything we need to do as a body to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| So I don't think time is of the essence, at least for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| where we would have to have something tomorrow afternoon or next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| We should be fine by meeting on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| I even thought about maybe having a joint session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| where we had both committees meet at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I intend on actually thought about an executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| if you can believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| I got worked over once before when I suggested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| And this is actually a perfect situation in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| But we can accomplish what we need to do in committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| I feel confident that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| So that's what I anticipate doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| And we will have a lot to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| So we'll wait and see what the judge tells us tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| But we've been working on some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| and we'll see what the judge tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Maybe we can have a real full discussion about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| beginning with our committee meetings a week from Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| Okay. Is there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Not being party to the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| but at least reading the judge's decision and some of the questions asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1030)|
| 0:17:19| there was a question about calling the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| And I was just wondering here that we really need clarification in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| procedures for calling a commission meeting or a committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| or any other committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I'm not quite sure what was done that was in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| or found to be in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| But clearly we need to clarify that so that all meetings that we hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| are called according to that procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Right now, I think there'd be several people that are still unclear about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| to call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| A special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| A special call meeting, not one that's a regular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| We'd have our regular call committee meetings that are set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| and a regular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| But allegedly bodies can meet at different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| and we need to know how to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| That became an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| There were a number of facts that when they're applied to that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and we can talk about those at greater length in a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| but a number of facts that when they're applied to that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| you can certainly come to the result that the jury did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Utilizing the same procedure that we have and that we've utilized for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| it still boils down to whether there's been a violation of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| But we will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| There were a number of concerns expressed by one of the attorneys in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| I don't think it necessarily hinged on our procedure as it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| but it has to do with the way that it was addressed factually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1158)|
| 0:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Can we talk to one another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I mean, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| I would certainly suggest that no commissioner talk to any other commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| about any matter of public business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| or a matter that may become public business until the Open Meetings Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1187)|
| 0:19:57| is addressed in perhaps recommendations made by the committee that you're on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| Commissioner, to somewhat relax this interpretation of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| It's a real shame that commissioners from the same district can't, it appears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| can't talk about matters related to their district without violating the Open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| For now, I would suggest that any and all discussions that you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| regarding matters of public importance be at a noticed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1230)|
| 0:20:39| I just want to announce that Mike Hammond and myself are going to be pumping gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| with the United Way at the pilot at Campbell Station Road on October the 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| from 7 to 7.30 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| We're going to promise to talk about the weather and the Vols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and not about county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Anybody who wants to can come get some gas and help out at United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| Mr. Law Director, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Let's say Commissioner Trammell and I being in the same district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| want to go to a homeowners' meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| Now, do we show up at the homeowners' meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| and we need to send the press notice that we're both going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| This happened the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| There was actually four commissioners at a homeowners' meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| I would notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| That was sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| But, you know, given the ruling, I'm not even sure that's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Oh, if you notice the meeting, you should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| You're providing, well, you need a couple of days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| You need 48 hours' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| So if the meeting itself has been published by the homeowners' association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| we need still to say to, I mean, I may not know if Commissioner Trammell is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| I may not know if Commissioner Hammond is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| but if I'm going, I need to send that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| That meeting was sunshine through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| There were a number of commissioners who had been sunshining every meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| where they are going to be in attendance along with another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| There are a number of commissioners who have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Well, I've been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| My question is, does that get it clean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Provide notice of the meeting, gives the public the opportunity to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| It certainly is notice to the media too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I would assume that the media shows up at a number of these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Mr. Law Director, so if we only receive a couple of hours' notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| say a subdivision is going to have a meeting and we hear about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| and they've called us but we get like maybe four hours' notice about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| that can just be factored out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| There's nothing to say that you can't go and listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| but you don't need to be at a meeting discussing public business matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| that are going to come before the body along with another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| So if two commissioners show up at a meeting and it has not been sunshineed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| then we should just not say anything at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yeah, if you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Mr. Law Director, I guess that means that if there's a zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| and that homeowner's group is asking for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| and there's another commissioner there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| can you say whether or not you're going to support them or not support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| or just say I can't say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| I would notice the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| You know, we had an orientation session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| The mayor called an orientation session first week of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| It might have even been before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| We talked about the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| We talked about where two or more of members of a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| are gathered together, thou shalt not conduct public business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| Now, there has been at least some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| going all the way back to an attorney general's opinion in 1988| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| that suggests that the law is not very clear, that it may require a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| We've talked about all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| and we certainly used that as a defense in our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1450)|
| 0:24:19| That argument has always been there, and we used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| It did not carry the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| The questions that went to the jury were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| did two or more commissioners deliberate in secret about matters of public business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| And if the answer to that is yes, then you violated the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| So if two or more commissioners are gathered together at any function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| and they discuss matters of public business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| matters that are either pending before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| or are going to be brought before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| then that is potentially a violation of the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| And so I would discourage you from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| There's a project that is going to affect both the 4th and 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| That's myself, Commissioners Trammell, Lutho, Lutho, and Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| If we send out a notice and say the five of us are going to gather at Shoney's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| at Walker Springs Road and go from there to look at this project, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| At that point, we can sit and talk among ourselves about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I think you have to give adequate public notice first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| It's a 48-hour notice, but we can then talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| See, I mean, the deeper you get into that, then the more issues that arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| The answer to that, the short answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| There are other provisions in the Open Meetings Act that take it further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| and we'll talk about that when we get our judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Obviously, if the press showed up and went with us, then we could talk freely about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| A noticed meeting, you've got to give proper notice, adequate public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| That was one of the questions that the jury answered, adequate public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| They said 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Well, it's 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| That is really the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| I prefer three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Forty-eight hours in this day and time with the technology that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| with the response of the media, it should be enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| John, I was listening to, as the jury was reading the interrogatories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| one of the interrogatories was if these commissioners had met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| did they file a synopsis, I guess you would say, of the results of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| So let's say that we meet at Shoney's and we do discuss business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Do we have to file minutes of that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Well, if it is a business meeting, one of the provisions is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| and what I was just alluding to, is the deeper that you get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| some other provisions may come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| We'll talk about all that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Maybe you have to take somebody from the clerk's office with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Somebody's got to record the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Record it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Somebody's got to be the official keeper of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| October 23rd is the next meeting that you were alluding to on the open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| 23rd in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Oh, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Yes, that's the open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| There's an open meetings and open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Mr. Hollow and I are both on the open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| So any suggestions that you gentlemen have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I'll be happy to take them along as we have that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| We have a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| Mr. Law Director, in the climate that we sit in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| say that we're out eating lunch talking about my deck on my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| needing to be repaired or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| and somebody hears us talking about a house and a deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| and somebody comes up and runs to one of the attorneys and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| oh, these three commissioners are sitting out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| and I know they were talking about county business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and here we go being drugged possibly back into a courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| And it's going to be hard to defend a negative newscast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1698)|
| 0:28:29| or written up in a paper that we were being drugged back into court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| Right now our law is not written from that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| Right now the burden of proof is still on the plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| to prove that a violation of the Open Meetings Act occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| And there was legislation introduced two years ago that switched that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| So basically you're guilty until you prove yourselves innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| They won't do anything but take a picture and twist it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| That was part of that legislation which failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| which resulted in this committee being established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and the committee is in its second year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| a committee that's looking over the acts, both the Open Meetings Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| and the Open Records Act, and making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| But as part of that bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| there were civil penalties involved in that bill as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| and that bill also made it abundantly clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| that the Open Meetings Act could be violated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| by two or more members of a public body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| So they changed the language there and it made it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| much more clear than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| But they also changed the burden of proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| The burden of proof switched to the official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| to prove that they hadn't violated the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Now that is not the law as we sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| The burden of proof is still upon the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| that is accusing the official of violating the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| But in this climate, right on the heels of a three-week-long trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| and this jury verdict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| I would be very careful about having any conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1828)|
| 0:30:37| with other commissioners outside of a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| Earlier today, I passed a fellow commissioner on the way in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| and I said they have something on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| and I said I'd like to co-sponsor that if that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| Is that a violation of the Sunshine Law, and if so, how do I cure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1857)|
| 0:31:07| I wasn't going to rat you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| John, I understand the law, and I think we all want to abide by the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| but I think it needs some common sense in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| and I think the state and maybe possibly across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| we need to get back to some common sense in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| I mean, I think for us, you're advising us not to even speak to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| It just tramples the First Amendment of every person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| that sits on a board across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| So how do we just get through daily life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| Well, you can certainly speak to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| I'm not saying that you don't talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| but what I'm saying is that in this climate and this day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and what you were just suggesting two minutes ago was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| should we even go to lunch together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Because there will be persons that will see commissioners together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| and they will automatically assume that you're discussing public business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| That is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| If you wish to have lunch with other commissioners and my advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| if you want to talk with other commissioners, that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| My advice would be in this climate and this day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| on the heels of a jury verdict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| I would just be very careful about any discussions that I might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| that would lead persons to believe that I was discussing public business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Getting back to the 202H, since these gentlemen came down here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| how much time do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| So at least the commissioners can have an idea when we may be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| That was four times, four times, and four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| That was three times, wasn't it, Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| Is that three weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Is that a week at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Or three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| More than three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| You know, because we have the PCARD audit coming out probably in a month or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| and then we're going to be having some other ones come out shortly thereafter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| So I don't want to drag this thing out forever and ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| I'd like to get it done and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| Could we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Could we combine this and the PCARD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I don't think nobody wants to stretch it out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I don't think nobody wants to get a lot of issues into one audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| I mean, I take the audits by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| I think we only called for this subpoena power for the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| So we won't be able to bring the PCARD into what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| unless we enact this again to include other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Is that correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| What do you say, because it takes two-thirds of the vote of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| what do you say, let's see, what is today the 4th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| The meeting of the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| What about the end of the month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Could you give us a time on the 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| No, I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Oh, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| I can do that about getting back together for another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Because it will take, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| you can schedule a workshop in pretty short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| I should have a better idea by the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| by the commission meeting of the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Do we need to add that item, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Do we need to add that item to our regular agenda so we can talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| I mean, here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| that's another thing is trying to add items to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| If we have, well, if we have two-thirds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| What we're, what I would be telling you is when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| what my time schedule would be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| and then we could, you could vote to set up a workshop at the 22nd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| We could do that for a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2141)|
| 0:35:50| Okay, before we end, Mary, I see you've got a gentleman with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| Do you all want to say anything or have any suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| No, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| We've responded in the audit and we stand by our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| Okay, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Okay, so I guess we'll talk about it again on the 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and get another date for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| On the 22nd, at our commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2176)|
| 0:36:27| I'll give you a better idea of when we'll be ready to have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| to talk about the procedures and the rules to follow during a 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| Okay, that's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Okay, we have no other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071004specialhearingws?start=2206)|
