| 0:04:00| Allison. I'm going to ask you a series of questions that you've been asked before when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| you first applied. So, remember you're under oath and you're testifying before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=245)|

| 0:04:18| of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years? No, sir. Has beer been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| sold here before? Yes. Okay, there is an outstanding license at this time. It will have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| surrendered to one you have previously. Yes, sir. Okay. The application is for on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| and off premises. Is that correct? Yes, sir. Okay. And do you own or lease this premise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| I lease it. Okay. Are you going to be the sole owner now? Yes. Okay. And who will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=289)|
| 0:04:58| operating this business on your behalf? I'm going to be running it and I've got a bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| Glenda. Okay, so you're going to be managing this? I'm going to be it. Are you familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| with the Knox County and Tennessee Beer Laws and Regulations and do you agree to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| your business in conformity with these laws? Yes, sir. Okay. Have you and your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| completed their server training program? Yes, sir. Okay. I'm going to ask the staff some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| questions, okay, at this time. Health Department? No problem. Fire Marshal? No problem. Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| Knox County Code Administration would like it to be noted that from the building to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| property line of a school, Carter Elementary is approximately 230 feet. Okay. There's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| existing license at this time. Fire Marshal? I meant Sheriff's Department. No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you, Mr. Law Director. I make a motion that this application be approved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=356)|
| 0:06:07| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=367)|
| 0:06:23| Ms. Allison, we wish you good luck in your endeavors. You may be seated. The thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=383)|
| 0:06:37| I wish to bring to your attention is now a little bit of public discussion. Captain Mays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=397)|
| 0:06:46| is going to be bringing us a bushel basket full of people that were not in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| with the law next month. This is prom and graduation exercise months, Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=414)|
| 0:07:08| so please be careful in the observance of not selling underage. Then, my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=428)|
| 0:07:16| there's something else that's not on our agenda, but you can see someone sort of hiding in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| front row. Roy, come over to the back of the podium. I need to stand on the other side? No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=441)|
| 0:07:32| you can stand right there and hide from us. It's normally backwards anyway, so this is good. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| you. I believe there is something that's occurring in Mr. Braden's life that we should probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| aware of. I think he's looking to change where he goes in the morning to report for work. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| correct. How many more days do you have in your current sentence? 60 days. We'll get to see you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=472)|
| 0:08:02| another time or two. I just want to say thank you for all the work that you've done for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| County. Now, we'll be saying it again in the future. Do you wish to introduce who may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| taking your position? Sean Payne is a plans examiner in our office. He will be substituting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| for me for 60 days. Kelly Vaughn is another person that will be here from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| to represent Knox County codes at the beer board meeting. Randy Lilly is the deputy building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| official, and he will be taking over those duties on June the 24th, which is a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=514)|
| 0:08:44| So, we get to see you another couple of work sessions. That's correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| Seeing no lights, no further discussion, the beer board is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=529)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for your kind attention. I call to order this the April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| 2017 meeting of Knox County Commission. Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| Commissioner Gill? Present. Commissioner Carringer? Here. Commissioner Smith? Here. Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| Here. Commissioner Schoonmaker? Here. Commissioner Anders? Here. Commissioner Bussler? Here. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| Wright? Here. Commissioner Daly? Here. Commissioner Thomas? Here. Commissioner Brantley? Here. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| members are present. All members being present. We have a couple of things that I need to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| of the way as we move into this meeting, and the very first thing that I'd like to do is the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| that was standing down here at the front. I'd like to recognize at this time U.S. Army retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=594)|
| 0:10:02| Major General John R. Jack DeRouche. Sir, if you would, I believe you have people with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=602)|
| 0:10:12| Could you call those people down, and let's recognize who's traveling with you. But first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| if I could ask our ESGR volunteers to step beside me here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=619)|
| 0:10:32| Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to acknowledge the people that you see in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=632)|
| 0:10:40| red, white, and blue colors are all volunteers who work to support our Guardsmen and Reservists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| and the relationships in fostering a better relationship with employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| And without them, this program simply would not exist. All hardworking volunteers. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=653)|
| 0:11:02| I would ask that you please remain there at the podium. I'm looking around the audience for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=662)|
| 0:11:13| Honorable Mayor Tim Burchett. Could I ask you to come down, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| And I believe that the General has something to say to you there, Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=677)|
| 0:11:34| First of all, let me thank Mayor Burchett and all the Commissioners on the Council for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| work that all of you have done in fostering the notion and enacting the legislation that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| for 30 days of military leave for Guardsmen and Reservists who are employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| And as you know, the law only requires 15 days. However, in the current environment we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| no longer can our nation execute its military strategy without the National Guard and Reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| And here in Tennessee, many of the units in the Tennessee area are priority units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| meaning they're going to have to train more than the traditional 39 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| Mayor Burchett and all of you have been instrumental in making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| And Mr. Mayor, I just want to tell you that I was up in Bristol this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| and one of our ESGR volunteers in that area told me, he said, by the way, I met with the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| of one of our local counties, and I told him what you all had done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| And he said, well, if Burchett can do it in Knox County, we can do it here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=766)|
| 0:12:56| That is precisely what we was hoping would happen with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| So in that regard, I'd like to present to you, Mr. Mayor, this Pro Patria Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=781)|
| 0:13:09| in the Latin meaning for the fatherland. And that's what Knox County has done with the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| that you've done to enable this legislation. And I've been the area chair here for almost three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| years, and I've never had the honor of presenting one of these. This award is the highest award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| that the state ESGR committee can present. And Mr. Mayor, it's my honor to present it to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| for all the work you've done for our Guard and Reserve people. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=818)|
| 0:13:55| Before I leave, we have one other additional award. Our state chairperson is about to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| And the good news is, his replacement, the new state chair for ESGR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Brigadier General Jim Munganast is here, and he has a presentation to make to the mayor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=848)|
| 0:14:21| In addition to the award of the Pro Patria Award that is received by the county, Captain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| Taryn Barrett also submitted Knox County for the Freedom Award. Now, the Freedom Award is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| national award that's given. There are 15 of those given each year, five in the category of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| governmental agencies. And you were nominated by Captain Barrett for that. Now, you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=884)|
| 0:14:53| receive the award, but there were 3,000 nominees nationwide, and Knox County was one of 148| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=893)|
| 0:15:03| that made the semifinals in that regard. So you look at it, you're cream of the crop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| with respect to what you have done, not just with the policies that have been put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| to provide additional days, but day in and day out, your managers and supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| and of course this all comes from the top, know and understand the importance of the Guard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| Reserve and to help them out so they can complete their mission without worrying about what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| happening back at the home front with their civilian employers. So today, Mr. Mayor, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| proud to present to you the Secretary of Defense Freedom Award 2017 Semifinalist Certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| honoring Knox County in recognition of exemplary support of National Guard and Reserve employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| Well done, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=950)|
| 0:16:04| Hello, members of the SGR. I'm at a loss for words. Actually, I remember something my dad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| told me one time. He said, all a general ever gave me was a hard time. So I appreciate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| brother. And I did want to note that our Congressman Jimmy Duncan's here and Bob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| Griffiths, and they're both veterans. We appreciate them being here today. And son John III's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| also. But honestly, the only reason that my name is on this is because I've got great people around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=984)|

| 0:31:02| the public welfare requiring it. Thank you, Madam Clerk. I'd like to introduce this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| the principal of Gibbs High School, Mr. Jason Webster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| I want to thank the County Commission and Commissioner Ride for recognizing these students. I've got a couple of other folks with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1874)|
| 0:31:22| Coach Tim Pittman, he is the head wrestling coach for our programs, does an outstanding job, also a teacher for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| Mr. Jeff Thomas, he is assistant principal and athletic director at Gibbs High School as well, and, you know, all the things that have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| said about these two, if I could just add one more thing, you know, we hear all kinds of things about young people today and sometimes it's not really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| Guys, these are two of the good ones, and I'm proud to be their principal, so thank you today for recognizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1909)|
| 0:32:06| Usually I sit up there and say, give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| But I'm not going to embarrass you by saying that. My conversation with this young lady on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| telephone about, can you come by commission so we can recognize you, because I'm a graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| of Gibbs High School, and I'm proud of Gibbs High School, and these two young adults make me even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| more proud. The thing that I wanted to know from her was, I need to know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| you look like so I can sort of stay away from you at graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| in case I were to do something wrong, maybe, but no, again, please, would you like to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| I just want to say thanks to, we got the best coaching staff in the state, with my dad and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| coach Tim Pittman, you know, whooping up on us every day, and it's a great accomplishment, and I want to thank you guys a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=1988)|
| 0:33:23| Don't get angry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2003)|
| 0:33:32| Sorry to hold up the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2012)|
| 0:33:54| or something, whatever that was, wow, that's amazing, that is amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| unlike girl power, you ready to go here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| That's going to get her in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2045)|
| 0:34:20| Madam Clerk, I believe item 104 is deferred, is that correct, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| Okay, I wish to back up for just a moment. I have people signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| Ms. Barbara Cook, do you wish to speak now or speak at the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2077)|
| 0:34:52| This is Ms. Barbara Cook, name and address for the record, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Cook, 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| Good evening. When I spoke to you, excuse me, when I spoke to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| last month, I was preceded by a citizen who referenced the bible, suggesting that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| approved the contract with Helen Ross McNabb for a behavioral health urgent care center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| you would be adding to the jewels in your crown and storing up treasures in heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| Well, I just want to caution you, before you start polishing those jewels, there is a reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| in Luke that goes something like, which of you intending to build a tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2140)|
| 0:35:47| sitteth not down first and counteth the cost, whether he has sufficient to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| As you are probably aware, the city council will vote tomorrow on an appeal of the zoning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| this facility, initiated by an individual in the community where the facility is to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2162)|
| 0:36:10| As a matter of fact, contingency plans are being made just in case that appeal fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| So, we will have a little time to speak to some of the issues that should have been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2177)|
| 0:36:27| before the contract got signed. By now, you surely have figured out that this experiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| is going to cost the taxpayers of Knox County and the city of Knoxville over two million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| Broken down, that equates to over 181 dollars per day bed, versus about 75 dollars a day in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2202)|
| 0:36:54| One doesn't have to search the internet very far to discover that there are multiple sources of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| that are being directed to this urgent need that has only been going on for about eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2221)|
| 0:37:09| Imagine my surprise to learn that, according to an article published by New Sentinel staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| in July of last year, there's a data-driven justice initiative that is intended to, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2235)|
| 0:37:24| divert some low-level non-violent offenders, including those with mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| out of the criminal justice system and change the approach toward incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| The result is expected to connect people with stabilizing support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| lessen and reduce the county reliance on jails, emergency rooms, and hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| Wow, that sounds familiar. The article included a picture of a sheriff's officer entering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| mental health pod at the detention facility, prepared to handle a capacity of 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| I had no idea. This is a subject that causes some folks to take leave of their senses in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2286)|
| 0:38:15| zeal to be on the correct side of the issue. As a matter of fact, some folks on our Next Door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| website don't see any problems with the idea. So just last night, I posted this in response to such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2303)|
| 0:38:32| an opinion. The problem I have is that $2 million of taxpayer money is being spent on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| that is yet to be defined in terms of what will actually take place, what the expected results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| are, and what methods will be used to determine if those results are achieved. Just throwing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| at a problem might satisfy some folks that help has been provided. They can sleep better at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| I want to know that there has actually been some help provided for these taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| Nobody benefits from, don't worry, we're good at this. I really appreciate community television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| of Knoxville. It gives me a chance to review what has taken place at these meetings. I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| appreciated that last month there were some commissioners, Commissioner Anders and Bob Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| especially, who pressed for more specifics as to how the success of this undertaking will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| measured, and for community involvement in the process. If this project moves forward, I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2377)|
| 0:39:46| very interested to see how much attention was paid to these remarks. I haven't seen anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2386)|
| 0:39:56| Have you? Oh, just one last thing. If there is anyone here who thinks that providing temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2396)|
| 0:40:06| housing for pregnant women in any way equates to providing a 72-hour hospice for miscreants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| they need to have more than their eyes examined. Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2414)|
| 0:40:23| Ms. Regina Ulster, do you wish to speak now or at the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| At the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| At this time, I would like to call on, continuing with public forum, Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2436)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you, Chairman Wright. We had an event last Friday out at East Bridge Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2444)|
| 0:40:59| We called it East Bridge on the Rise celebration, and we talked about several different things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| recent accomplishments and how we've kind of set the stage, I believe, for some more success. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| know that all the commissioners weren't able to attend that, so Commissioner Wright asked if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| would please come and just share a little bit of that and kind of show you one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| we presented there. But, you know, we've had a few other things. I'll just mention those very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| quickly. We recently were able to extend Holston-Mindrive, which opened up or fully opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| up the access to 121 acres of prime industrial property, and that we used a TBA and Best Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| grant to help pay for half of that. We've got some things going on, like expansion of lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| and a one megawatt solar array that just opened up out there. And, you know, we went through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| process to get Knox County three-star certified so that we could, one of the things we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| would be to apply for a grant. And it was something the state of Tennessee started doing to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| communities to invest in themselves and encourage them. And it was one last really piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| infrastructure that was remaining to make that property fully development ready, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| an extension of wastewater services out there. So we applied for that. It's about a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| dollars worth of work, so we applied. And I do want to point out, Ray, why don't you stand up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| Ray works for Development Corporation and put him at task to do that, put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| a fantastic grant, as well as working on the three-star in Tennessee and Best Prep. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| want him to come here and get recognized for that. But we were successful. We went to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| competed for that with other communities across the entire state. We've got our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| Tennessee Select certified. We have two of only 44 existing sites still left in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| that have been designated by the state as Tennessee Select certified. So it really sets the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| for investment. This half million dollars will be used toward an extension of wastewater services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| to provide that for the entire back half. And it's a company that's looking at our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| There was an article in the paper last week, House of Thaler, which is a company out off Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| It's been a long-standing company that's really seen a resurgence, some new product development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| that they've put together, and they're looking to put a plant that'll employ 161 in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| to the 172 employees they have. So those are successes that we're going to hope to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| more of them, but we couldn't do it without wastewater, and we couldn't do it without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| road extension. So just wanted to share that good news with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2615)|
| 0:43:45| Thank you, Mr. Naper. Are there any questions or any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| If not, I would like to make the comment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| I believe, as Mayor Burchett would say it, we don't need to raise taxes. We need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| increase the base. I see him back there. He said that's exactly what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| Again, thanks to the Development Corporation. This $500,000 grant on this wastewater treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| from the state of Tennessee for economic development is presented here in the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| area region, which is several counties. I believe our grant was $500,000. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| all the other grants were in the range of $50,000, and they were most in tourism development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2671)|
| 0:44:40| Again, I applaud the Development Corporation for looking for bringing jobs to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| not just tourism. Again, thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| Continuing public forum. Dwight VandeVeet, is there a Dwight VandeVeet in the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2699)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dwight VandeVeet, 205 West Baxter Avenue. I know we're off to a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| start, so I'll be brief. I just wanted to call to your attention that distributed to each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| the latest iteration of the strategic transportation plan. Now, I emailed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| one about a month ago, and I would want to point out that this does supersede the one that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| received by email. This is the latest version. It incorporates the most recent data from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| Titan system, and it is something I would encourage you to read. It has served us well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| since its initial publication. One of the challenges for the mayor, for our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| and for all of you, is to make sure that we put the resources that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| to use as efficiently as possible, and we put them in the area of greatest need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and not the area of loudest voice. The STP really gives us a platform from which to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2757)|
| 0:46:06| We will make ourselves available to all of you. We would encourage you to let us know when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| have time to discuss it, because we'd like to sit down with you and discuss both the STP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| and the upcoming paving plan, because they are, in a certain sense, companion pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| so that each of you will know what we anticipate may be happening in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| and so we can answer any questions you may have about what the consultants determined were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| areas of criticality that we needed to address from a safety improvement standpoint. That really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| is the primary focus of the STP, is safety. It does contemplate congestion and some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| variables, but the primary focus of the STP is safety, and that'll continue to be our primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| focus. So, as you've had time to read it, please let us know when you've got time to talk. We'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| like to sit down and again discuss both the STP and the upcoming resurfacing plan with you, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| you'll have a full understanding of what we propose for your district. And in keeping with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| the spirit of the day, since there has been a little bit of time to talk about accolades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| I don't want to pile on, but I do want to mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| the only ones who are fans of the STP. The STP in March was awarded the best in category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| by the American Consulting Engineers Council for studies and research, and we are very proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| of that. We're proud of what the STP represents for good data-driven public policy as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| to transportation. There wouldn't be an STP in your hands if it weren't for three people I need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| to mention very specifically. Cindy Pianchi has been our project lead from the start and has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| closely with the consultant. John Sexton, and I would ask them to stand please. John Sexton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| also one of our senior staff engineer who manages the inbound data into the STP, which is a critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| element. And our chief engineer, Jim Snowden, who just makes good things happen every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| This report would not exist if it weren't for the three of them, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| just ask that they be recognized. I ask that they come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2898)|
| 0:48:30| John is somebody I'll mention too while he's here because you don't see him that much, but John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| is the face and voice of Knox County at traffic calming meetings, and for those of you that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| been to traffic calming meetings in your district, you know what a challenge that is. And I could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2921)|
| 0:48:48| ask for anybody to handle it with more grace and diplomacy than John Sexton just does a fine job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| with us. Hold the award so we can get a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2933)|
| 0:49:11| Again, just as each of you have time, please call us. That's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| We will make ourselves available. We'll go through the STP with you. We'll go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| the pavement management plan with you, and lots of good things to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| and I think my time is up. Thank you, Mr. VanVleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| I think that's the end of public forum, and we are down to the devotional. Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2973)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are ready to move along here. In the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| several of us have been very fortunate to visit Clear Springs Baptist Church and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| meet this gentleman, Reverend Jerry Vitito, who is, he and his wife Shirley, just really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| what a blessing it is for that church, and I invite him to come by and do our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| So, Jerry, if you'll step to the podium, we appreciate you being here and what you do for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| the community out there in Gibbs. Thank you. I would like to lead in a prayer at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| please. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day. It's the day that the Lord has made. Let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3015)|
| 0:50:22| rejoice and be glad in it. It's a good day to be alive. It's a good day to live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| Lord, we are led by wonderful people, men and ladies who give their time and their efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| and their energy and their talents to making life better for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| I have great admiration for people who do that because they touch and affect my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| They touch and affect my church and, Lord, so many others that I do not know or have never met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3050)|
| 0:50:59| There's a passage of scripture, Father, that we believe in and know to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| It says, trust in the Lord with all your heart. Lead not to your own understanding. In all your ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3065)|
| 0:51:15| acknowledge him, and he will direct your path. Lord, that we pray that that will be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| for each of us, that we'll turn to you for guidance and for wisdom. Even the psalmist in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| Psalms 23 talked about the great shepherd leading us and guiding us and directing us in paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| of righteousness. May it be so for this commission. I pray for our mayor. I pray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| for the chairman of county commission. I pray for every commissioner and, Lord, some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| I've had the privilege of worshiping with and calling them my friends. Lord, I pray for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| of them as they deliberate tonight and in the days ahead. They are servants of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| but, Lord, may they also be your servants and go at your bidding and look to you for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| It was the Apostle James who would say, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not. Thank you for that wonderful promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| Thank you for this county commission. Thank you for all who have assembled here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| We pray grace and mercy upon each in Jesus' name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you, Pastor Vitito. The Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Commissioner Michelle Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| I'll stand and salute the pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3170)|
| 0:53:02| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3182)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3199)|
| 0:53:33| Let me try that again. I believe, no, I know that the Chair of the Board of Education is with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3213)|
| 0:53:41| tonight, Ms. Patti Bounds. I recognize you for being here and also her partner in crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3221)|
| 0:53:50| her new partner in leadership, the Superintendent of the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3230)|
| 0:53:59| Bob Thomas, Super Bob Thomas. I need to give titles here, Super Bob Thomas. We appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| you being here. She's hiding behind the TV camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3246)|

| 0:54:40| recently, and then I'd like to go on and wish Russ Oaks a speedy recovery. He's been absent for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3280)|
| 0:54:50| couple, three weeks and is, I hope, recuperating well at home, and then I'd also like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| the family of Henry Leslie Red Dillingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| resident of Nashville, the father of Doug Dillingham, who we see at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| That's his dad. His dad has passed away, so I believe his dad was 88, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| and it's been with some concern that he suffered ill health. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| my fellow commissioners, for allowing me that time of recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=3327)|

| 1:16:20| Motion is seeing no further discussion the motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| to approve these consent items as read. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| Motion carries. Madam Clerk let me address my fellow commissioners for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| If there be no objection I would like to move to Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4604)|

| 1:17:13| I hear no objection. Madam Clerk would you please read Resolution 301. Okay it's located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| on page 7. It's a resolution approving Amendment 2 to the contract with Securus Technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4641)|

| 1:17:53| acquiring the tablets. Thank you Madam Clerk. Do I hear a motion to approve? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4673)|
| 1:18:03| My fellow commissioners the reason that I wanted this discussed is because I believe there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| lack of information distributed out of our discussion from this past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| This is an enlargement of a contract that has existed since May of 2015 as a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4699)|
| 1:18:30| The Detention Facility has viewed this as a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| I wanted to make sure that any questions that might exist here amongst the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| be discussed to the extent necessary and I'd also like to draw your attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| information that has been released by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| Sheriff's Office as it relates to how the system operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4737)|
| 1:19:06| I'm going to go to Commissioner Carringer because I was looking that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| and then when I turned around and looked the other way there were three lights on so I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| talk to Commissioner Carringer first and then I will go down the row on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| Commissioner Carringer. Thank you Chairman. I just wanted to state because there were some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| that some of us got emails, Facebook messages about because it was not related back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| public, the truth about this. Knox County Commission is not giving the inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4777)|
| 1:19:46| tablets like it was stated last week. This is as Commissioner Chairman said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4786)|
| 1:19:55| something that has been ongoing with the Sheriff's Office. They do not have open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| internet. These are some of the questions and emails that I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| and it is something that the inmate's family pays for. So the money that is being used is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4805)|
| 1:20:14| within the Sheriff's Office that the inmates families are paying. So I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4814)|
| 1:20:22| you know there's not a Commissioner up here that would be for just taking that money out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| general fund and giving it to all of our inmates versus giving it to our students in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| So I and I think that discussion will be brought up where I just want everyone out there in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| public to know the real facts behind this and I know Commissioner Andrews knows more about all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4839)|
| 1:20:48| this and probably the rest of us and can explain it even better. Commissioner Andrews. Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| Two things that really were put out to the public that you know that like she said that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| paying for. Zero tax dollars. I mean I before I made that statement to anybody I called and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| confirmed with Chris. Zero tax dollars are paying for this and this is something that occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| started occurring back when Securus got the contract and this is a form of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| and visitation. This is this has made the jail more efficient and if most people don't know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| jail's operating with less people than it should at times and so or then it's preferred. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| know that it should but preferred and and this has made that process more efficient more safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4892)|
| 1:21:40| and and another thing is that the money's used to purchase these new tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| are coming off there. It's you know the contract gives the current contract allows the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Office to charge. Part of that charge is given to the company that provided the equipment. Part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| of that charge is given to the Sheriff's Office. We are forfeiting that charge to the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| Office till this equipment is paid for. If we bought all 24 or I'm sorry 900 tablets if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4921)|
| 1:22:10| bought them all and I don't know that we're plans to buy them all tomorrow. If we bought them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| and we turned the same kind of commission that we've turned the last 12 months everything's paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| for in 24 months then you're back to draw on your commission of what is now $15,000 a month could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| go up to $60,000 $70,000 a month. So this is not negative. This is not revenue negative. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| tax dollars out first. It is something that they have chosen to make the jail more efficient safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| and I don't know that other than the fact that people just don't think that inmates should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| access to a tablet which is not what you buy your kids or for education. It's not what we buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| for entertainment. It is it has a purpose and I'm not here I'm I will never vote for anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4971)|
| 1:22:59| entertain a prisoner and I think it's shameful that the facts weren't presented to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| correctly last week and I hope that although some will still disagree and I get that this isn't has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| nothing to do with entertainment it has nothing to do with tax dollars. It is being done with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| purpose and a two-year pilot that's already been in place. And adding to what you said you you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| Chris when you were talking about financial our finance director I wanted to say the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| director of Knox County Chris Caldwell. Commissioner Bussler. Thank you Mr. Chairman. In a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| I guess social media events my name was mentioned a couple of times about you know using taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5018)|
| 1:23:47| dollars for these tablets and and my numbers were on my card that if people are interested in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5027)|
| 1:23:57| was going on they could call and ask questions and I was kind of taken aback that we have people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5037)|
| 1:24:03| the public will just put something out on social media without doing any research. As a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5043)|
| 1:24:12| we have our main responsibility is to oversee taxpayers dollars and along with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5052)|
| 1:24:20| Andrews and Commissioner Carringer I would not spend anything any kind of money for recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5060)|
| 1:24:30| purposes for inmates. So I just want to put that out there and if you are interested what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5070)|
| 1:24:41| you can contact us our phone numbers are available to call us directly. I even have my home phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5081)|
| 1:24:48| number on my directory here at the county commission and not once was I called and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5088)|
| 1:24:57| once was I asked or not once was I given a chance to explain how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5097)|
| 1:25:05| So please if you see something that you don't understand please call and ask instead of putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5105)|
| 1:25:13| something out there that is not true about somebody that you don't even know or wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| even call and ask those questions to. So anyway that's all I'm putting out there. I was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| upset that you read one thing but you don't dig into it and find out what the real truth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you Mr. Commissioner Thomas. Thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| You know I did get a lot of phone calls I don't know why they're not calling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| So they did call me and Sheriff Jones just a couple of quick questions please sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5144)|
| 1:25:52| First of all I really want I appreciate this that answered every question I think that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| wrote me long emails about and this is really important so I really appreciate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| and I answered a lot of emails as well a lot of us. Is this available online? Can people get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5164)|
| 1:26:11| to this so they can read all this? It's not yet but we'll be glad to put it on the website. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| would be great so they could see exactly the answers to almost every single question that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| got via email. That was really yeah just make sure that people understand that this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5180)|
| 1:26:29| something where we're we're taking tax dollars but I think if it potentially as Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| Anders said 60-70,000 a month possibly. Yeah roughly probably $750,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| And another thing that somebody brought up to me they said well what if it's somebody that cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| afford to pay the 40 cents. I explained to them you still got the kiosk that's absolutely free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Right free access just like they we always did before technology was the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| still go to jail you use the kiosk for free it doesn't cost anything. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| And I and I let me just add something real quick I appreciate the comments that were made here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| and I can assure you that that I would never bring you anything to ask you to spend tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| to ask you to spend tax dollars to entertain inmates in our jail. We we don't do that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| not the holiday inn. I can assure you that the safety issue of of this of what we brought you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| was the number one concern not the making money. The least amount of time that an inmate has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| be physically handled by staff cuts down on on injury issues. That's the number one goal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5253)|
| 1:27:41| we have. The number two goal is if you know the criminal justice system criminals don't pay much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| back it lies on the tax the backs of the taxpayers. So when they break in your house and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| they sell your tv for 10 cents on the dollar and we catch them and they go to jail they get a free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| lawyer they get their court costs waived and we keep them in jail for a hundred dollars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| In my 36 years I've never seen the opportunity for an inmate to pay back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| to the tax to the taxpayers of of what we spend on them. This is that perfect opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| and that and that's why we went forward with it. And to call this an ipad this is really more just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| a communication device. Absolutely it's not a tablet and I think that's where the miscommunication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| was. I think the terminology was was what misled a lot of people. This is a uh and and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| it cost there was questions too about what it costs. It's built almost indestructible. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| can't take the batteries out of it you know people who have 24 hours a day to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| you have to make things special for them. So it has it has to be indestructible where the batteries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| can't be taken out where they can't use it to hurt anybody else. So that and and the software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| from Securus is put into it so it's not in you can't get on the internet you can't hack into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| anything. It's a it's a communication device used by the inmates and the staff. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| thank you Sheriff. Thank you. And if you would remain there I recognize this is the high sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| of Knox County. Yeah 400 Main Street. Jimmy. I didn't call anybody a dirtbag today either. JJ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| Jones. Wait right there. Commissioner Daly. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Sheriff Jones uh safety is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| I'm concerned about as you are for for our officers. Uh number one they don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| communication pad. How they have to order from the commissary that means they have to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| contact with an officer. Absolutely everything that they do on this pad limits the contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| physical contact with one of our staff which automatically cuts down on the chance of injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| And a lot of time because if they order something they ordered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| A second thing is that they can order medical off of this. There's a there's a hard copy medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| there that's a safety factor. Again no contact with nobody can say nobody can say it got lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| Nobody can say they didn't get seen by medical people. So it it leaves a paper trail a non-paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| trail but a computer trail and and it's just more efficient. And the third thing is that uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| I'm sure you have to report to the state the federal government. This I'm sure will make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| a lot easier that inmate xyz you can pull his tablet up real quickly and once they're not on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| it now you got to go pull files I'm sure and you got to make copies and so this is a time saver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| Number one it's a safety factor. Number two it's it's a time saver to have these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| to do other things. Absolutely and that's the reason that we we went down this path. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| Smith. Thank you Mr. Chair. Uh JJ I agree with you completely. If these hadn't been called tablets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| a lot of this I think could have been avoided because inmate pads prison pods something along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| that line might have saved some confusion. Um I uh did a lot of research on this and not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| talked to Chris but I also talked to Allison from your your department and a lot of people think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| we're paying for these things up front 425,000 but the way I understand this is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| is the commissions we are receiving off of it we're only going to buy that amount each month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| until we find the utility rate where use goes down. We may not even buy 900 we may not get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| one-on-one. It may be it may be 700 it may be 800. That's correct. And the reason it takes a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5495)|
| 1:31:43| to get these are these these are not like again these are not like the tablets you go in and buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| from office depot. These have to be made specifically for this incident. The only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| question I have is the gold pass. What is the gold pass? That means you can keep one 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| Okay. Which a lot which a lot of them do. Okay. Thank you sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5519)|

| 1:32:26| Jr. as a member and selecting an alternate member on the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| Merit System Council. This this is kind of odd because there's a blank place in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| Do I hear a motion to approve so we can discuss and fill in the names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5559)|

| 1:33:02| Please give your name and address for the record please. Gina Oster 9536 Briarwood Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| Knoxville. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| I've communicated with each of you that I'm interested in serving on the Sheriff's Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| Council. This is a position I've wanted to hold for quite a while but the timing was never quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| right. Now that I'm an empty nester I have a lot of time on my hands and I can use that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| to dedicate to the council. As you see in my resume I've spent my adult life volunteering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| in our community and in our schools. I currently serve on the Knox County Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| and will be serving in June on the Knox County Tax Board. I've also have a heart for our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| enforcement officers. I'm the founder of an organization called Cookie Crusaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| which tries to show our officers each month that they are appreciated one cookie at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| Even though I have a heart for our officers I also know serving on the Merit Council is to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| impartial and that is important to me as I want to make sure that our officers are getting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| best opportunity for our community that can give them but also to be impartial with disciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| actions. As I serve on the Ethics Committee is important to me for all of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| employees work hard to be ethical and above board in their jobs and I know I can bring that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| bring that to the position as well. I want to ask for your support and I want to also thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| your consideration on this matter. I believe I would serve Knox County Sheriff's Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| well. As Knoxville is my home I know the importance of serving our community to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| it a better place for each of us. Thank you again. I call on Mr. Cliff Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5678)|
| 1:34:47| Cliff Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| He sent an email to all of us. Yes Mr. Chairman I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| that we appoint Jim Wright Jr. as a member of the Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| and defer to the May meeting the selection of the alternate member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| to hear from Mr. Beeler and I do believe he has a medical some type of medical emergency. He just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5710)|
| 1:35:16| became a a new father and his wife had lots of complications and they just came home from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| hospital this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5722)|
| 1:35:38| What we have before us is a substitute motion with a proper second that it become the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| motion is what we're voting on right now that it become the primary motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5746)|
| 1:35:54| and as I hear Commissioner Daley your motion is that we and this Jim Wright is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5754)|
| 1:36:04| a relative of mine. I do not know is Jim Wright here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| I do not know Jim Wright Jr. but the motion is I hear a motion is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5769)|
| 1:36:18| appointing Jim Wright as a member and postponing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| appointment of the alternate till next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| Yes we're going to have discussion of this substitute motion. The motion is made by Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5789)|
| 1:36:39| I second the motion for discussion. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Oh I wasn't the first one on. Oh okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| Commissioner Anders. Well I was I was as we got into the process I was going to nominate Miss Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| I really don't have an objection to that. I just want to make sure that I'm clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| I was just going to nominate her for for the spot. That was just the intention of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| Well thank you Mr. Chairman. I guess my question is there is no urgency to have Mr. Wright on the merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5827)|
| 1:37:15| board. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| There is no urgency to have Mr. Wright on the merit board at this moment according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| according to the Sheriff of Knox County. So why don't we just defer the whole thing the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| resolution till next month instead of taking and splitting the resolution. I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| Okay I guess the maker of the motion wanted to make sure that if there was a need during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| the month that the person I'm just speculating now Commissioner Daly is saying that he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| he would like to see the permanent seat filled since we're doing we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| Well can I just a minute just a minute just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| Ed Brantley. Thank you Mr. Chairman. My thought is Gina's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| I don't know Jim Wright. Jim Wright is going. I know Jim. He's going to be elevated to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5896)|
| 1:38:27| permanent member. What we were discussing was the choice between the two alternates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| Okay. Now then continue. Well she's the only one that's here and is the only one that's been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| and I agree with Brad. I mean that's I think that goes a long way that you want the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| Commissioner Nystrom. I've got a friendship with both Miss Regina and I'm very close with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| Mr. Wright. For those of you who don't know Jim he is a long-term just hard-working blue-collar guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| owns owns Vineyard Flooring down on on Broadway and is very dedicated to helping with you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5940)|
| 1:39:09| very excited to have this opportunity to serve on it. So I've known him for years so I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| vouch for him. Secondly I've also had multiple meetings with Regina and I know she's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| match of both passion for the cause and logic to be objective you know based on her experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| on our ethics committee. Commissioner Carringer. Yeah I just I just wanted I've been very familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| with how we do the merit council for a long time and the way that process goes is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5974)|
| 1:39:41| alternate serves and then they automatically move in to the regular member and you pick another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5981)|
| 1:39:49| alternate. So I think to go ahead and move and you all would know Mr. Wright if he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5989)|
| 1:39:58| He's been to several meetings before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| Right and he's been to several other meetings but the process is to move your alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| up to the spot that he served his time as being the alternate. So I think it's fine to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| since we've got a second that Carson made to go ahead and move Mr. Wright he has served his time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| to move into that permanent spot and then if we want to select an alternate at next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| That's to go ahead and put him. Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6027)|
| 1:40:36| These names have been out there a while there's been plenty of time to receive phone calls from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| the candidates and emails. I'm not sure that someone's lack of presence here is really that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| important to going ahead and doing this. So I kind of I'm with Brad. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| Thank you Mr. Chairman. I too know Gina Oster. In fact probably 15 years ago when she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| very much involved in the Cedar Bluff PTA and has done an outstanding job in their volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| capacity. And as the county commission representative to the ethics board I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6066)|
| 1:41:14| know that she does appear at the meetings even though at times we don't have things to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| So she is very active and very concerned about what's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6079)|
| 1:41:26| And I would be in favor of going ahead and voting tonight on the alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| Seeing no further discussion the motion that is before us as a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| is to appoint Mr. Wright as the member and to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6099)|

| 1:46:13| Okay. Now then, the resolution, Madam Clerk, please read the resolution 111 with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6373)|
| 1:46:23| It's appointing Jim Wright Jr. as a member and Gina Oster as an alternate member on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| Knox County Sheriff's Office Merit System Council. Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6389)|
| 1:46:36| Motion is properly before us. Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6396)|
| 1:46:43| Opposed, no. The motion carries. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6403)|
| 1:46:53| Congratulations. You got lost in the wrestling match. We're not much at wrestling. The wrestlers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| were here earlier. The congratulations in your appointment. Good luck in your endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| Madam Clerk. We're on resolution 114. It's approving the appointments of Stuart B. Blackstock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| and James K. Beck as hearing officers for the Knox County Board of Equalization. Do I hear a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| motion? So moved. Second. Motion is properly before us to approve. Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6440)|
| 1:47:31| all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries. Madam Clerk, it's 220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| 220 listed on page 7. It's a resolution approving a contract with AT&T for long-term lease fiber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| ethernet, and internet services at all Knox County public library locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| I move to approve. Mr. Law Director, is this contract in proper order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| Yes, it is, Mr. Chairman. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6474)|
| 1:48:01| Motion is properly before us to approve. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6481)|
| 1:48:09| The motion carries. Madam Clerk. Next item is resolution 703 listed on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| It's approving the first amendment to ground lease agreement with Iams Nature Center Incorporated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| property known as Mead's Quarry, which amendment removes the Quarry Lake area from the lease and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| provides for Knox County, under the supervision of the Senior Director of Knox County Parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| Recreation, to assume complete regulatory authority of the Quarry Lake area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6511)|
| 1:48:39| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| Commissioner Anders. Yeah, if Doug could come down and kind of, because this kind of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| the dynamic a little bit over there. I want to make sure people are clear about it. The way that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| have been explained to is that we are coming, Iams will no longer lease the surface of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6535)|
| 1:49:03| Correct. And River Sports will continue to act as a vendor on most of the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| but we're going to put out a public swim area, swim at your own risk, public swim area in the Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6550)|
| 1:49:18| Correct? That's correct. Okay, and so who, I guess we're doing swim at your own risk, where does the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6558)|
| 1:49:26| county and where does Iams and everybody fall within, and River Sports, fall within the liability issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| For the swim at your own risk, it'd be similar to what we operate at the other county parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| at Concord Park and Mountain Hill, we have designated swim areas that are also swim at your own risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| So we would manage this the same way, and if I could too, just a quick background here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| Iams is under new leadership, Amber Parker, she's actually here tonight if you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| questions for her, and what she did was look at their insurance policies at the Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| They could do swimming, but they would have to provide lifeguards, and they don't have the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| to do that right now. Amber's going to go through a planning process with the board there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| I serve on the board of directors as well, in the next year to really see how this fits in Iams mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| So this we're looking at as a way to get through the summer, try to maintain the service to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| re-evaluate the operation, and perhaps come back in the future with some other changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| but really trying to get us through this summer and study it and watch it and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| Okay, so as you're going through this summer, and I'm assuming it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| hours are going to be posted and things like that, it sits inside the city, it's property of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6630)|
| 1:50:38| To have those rules enforced, the county is going to have to help the city prosecute, or I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| somebody from Parks and Rec is going to say these are our rules, these are our posted rules, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| you're going to have to prosecute for trespassing after hours or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| I would assume that would be the same way we manage John Tarleton Park, you know, it's a county park within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| So we're doing the same, okay, exactly. I just want to clear those things up, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| Thank you, Commissioner Andrews. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I guess this is for the law director. I've heard a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| liability questions. How much liability does the county have? Is there a limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| is there a non-limit, or give us a little short breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| Well, we have any exposure, of course. There is a statutory limit on recreational liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6679)|
| 1:51:26| from the state of Tennessee. That being said, that would be used as a defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| Anytime you're dealing with the public, we're always exposed and could actually result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| litigation, but statutorily we should be protected because it is a recreational activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| I've heard $300,000. Is that a good number or a bad number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| That's the Government Tort Liability Act limit, but as I said, under where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6712)|
| 1:52:00| we would be using a statutorial defense, which would not take us hopefully under a get-lay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| We should be able to be dismissed based on another statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6726)|
| 1:52:11| Mr. Patel. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Explain the improvements that we talked about at the board meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| You're going to have some new dock area, safety dock and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| Yes, sir. We're going to look. The old swimming area had a floating dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| which was really not functioning real well. IAMS took it out of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| so we're going to look at building a new dock there that would be much more stable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| probably redefine the swim area a little bit to make it as safe as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| Did have a couple of, okay, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think those were some of my concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| and if there's going to be a public comment period, and I mean really, I know this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| swim at your own risk, but the liability associated with that and allowing the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| to understand that the changes in that, what kind of time frame are we looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| that that will actually affect? I'm sure it'll take us at least a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| month to make those improvements down there, so we'll post it that the improvements are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| so folks will know, but yeah, by the time we get down there, we're already looking at a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| on it. We have some fabrication to do, some construction to do that will take a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| bit of time. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Doug, being familiar with risk management, I understand the concept and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| the reasoning behind this. This is probably the only way this will work and still be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| to maintain public use of the facility. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| That's correct at this point. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve this amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| contract. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| Opposed, no. The motion carries. Thank you, Doug, and thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6833)|
| 1:54:01| Madam Clerk. Resolution 909, I'm sorry, it's listed on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| It's to transfer the responsibility of operating and managing the Knox County Fraud and Compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| Hotline from the Risk Management Department to the Internal Audit Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6854)|
| 1:54:20| This motion is made on behalf of the Audit Committee. I move that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| Commissioner Nystrom. For the benefit of the folks in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| for years this particular hotline has been run by the Risk Management Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| but in the Audit Committee, and based on the help from our audit team, we found that best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| in this area are to have the line actually operated by our Internal Audit Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| So we felt after two different discussions on this that this would be in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| of the county. So we, as a committee, which is myself, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6894)|
| 1:54:59| and Commissioner Wright, thought this was in our best interest. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6899)|
| 1:55:07| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to move this function within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| the administration of Knox County. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, no. The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6912)|
| 1:55:24| Let me ask one more time before we continue. Are there other persons wishing to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6924)|
| 1:55:31| public forum this evening? Are there other persons wishing to speak this evening public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6931)|
| 1:55:42| Madam Clerk, next item. It's listed under other business on page 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| spread of record, the bond of Robert M. Thomas, Superintendent of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| Through the spread of record, the bond is accepted and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| Madam Clerk. Oh, what she just accomplished is all we have to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6958)|
| 1:56:07| You're okay there, Super Bob. Madam Clerk. On page 14, discussion regarding the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| County Commission Committee's terms of the membership of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| For this item we discussed last Monday, there will be information provided the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6978)|
| 1:56:26| Commission on how the membership of the Audit Committee works and where we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| at the next sessions of County Commission. Is there other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=6993)|
| 1:56:40| Seeing no further discussion, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| Yeah, is this a plug and announcement time? Can we do that or do you want to wait till after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| zoning? No, no. Madam Clerk, does that complete our business of the evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7009)|
| 1:56:58| Commissioner Anders, we are now in announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7018)|

| 1:57:12| Sexual Assault Awareness Month and I think it's Friday night, I think, in the hue. Are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| familiar with it? Helen Ross McNabb is doing a public awareness event at the Blue Slip Winery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| I believe it starts at six o'clock, so come on out and support Helen Ross and her cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7043)|

| 1:57:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to mention this Friday and Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| you know, I've heard Chief Roush say it many times, don't be an accidental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7083)|

| 2:02:37| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| The Planning Commission recommends that you approve the RA zoning as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7359)|
| 2:02:45| This is a matter that was on the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| Seeing none, I move to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Yes, sir. I didn't hear. I was apologizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| Are you representing the property owner and what's your relationship with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| Yes, I'm the surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| Good luck in your endeavors, Mr. Abbott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| 3-A-17-SP is a request of Ball Homes, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| for Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment from RR Rural Residential to LDR Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| properties located north side of Hardin Valley Road, west of Seal Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| I'm here on behalf of the applicant along with Ryan Hickey with Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| The Planning Commission recommends that you adopt the resolution changing the Sector Plan to Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| This matter was heard on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| May I make one comment, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| In the commentary that MPC has on this, there is a comment for that we would connect into the parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7457)|
| 2:04:28| have stub roads into the parcels on the east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| To connect into the one on the west, we would have to cross a blue line stream and bridge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| We ask not for any action here but just to state that we will be opposed to that when we submit the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7479)|
| 2:04:50| They want us to do it to the property on the east also and we would be opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| They also want a pedestrian connection between this subdivision and the new schools out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| We have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| We understand and will be providing that pedestrian connection for the school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| Let me ask first, is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| Mr. Kelly, are those stipulations on the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| No, those are not specific conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| These are items that we expect them to address in one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| They are addressing them saying right now that they object, so we will talk about it when they bring their plan in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7531)|
| 2:05:36| One of them we agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is to approve per MPC recommendation this sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7543)|
| 2:05:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Opposed no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| The next item is 3-D-17-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| It's a request of Ball Homes LLC for rezoning from agriculture to PR plan residential at a density up to 4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7563)|
| 2:06:11| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| Arthur Seymour Jr. and Mr. Hickey here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| The Planning Commission recommends that you approve plan residential at three units per acre as opposed to the four units as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7584)|
| 2:06:34| That matter was discussed at the Planning Commission meeting or with the applicant prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| and it was approved at three units per acre on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| I can ask a question before we have a motion, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| Dan, is this one of those cases where we are in the urban growth area and we are limited to the number of units we can place per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7611)|
| 2:06:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| We keep running up against this, and I keep talking about we need to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| and pretty soon we're going to develop all of our land at a lower utility than we could have got out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7626)|
| 2:07:12| and I'm wondering when we're going to actually take some action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| I think we'd need to look to Nashville for that answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7638)|
| 2:07:27| To amend the urban growth plan would require a reconvening of the Urban Growth Boundary Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| which would involve Knox County, the city of Knoxville, and the town of Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| The number of the members of that original committee, which last met I think in 2000 or 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| are either not with us anymore or have moved on, and reconvening that would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7667)|
| 2:07:56| I think it would be a good idea for Knox County, perhaps in conference with other counties who are running up against the same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7676)|
| 2:08:06| to consider asking the next session of the legislature to abolish that requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7686)|
| 2:08:13| because the Urban Growth Boundary Act was really directed at finger annexation and spot annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7693)|
| 2:08:25| by a former mayor of our city and others throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| With the amendments to the annexation law, that is no longer possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| so really it's sort of meaningless in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Seymour, did this original legislation require any meetings to update this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7721)|
| 2:08:48| It required that the Urban Growth Boundary Committee meet every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| Subsequent to that, to my knowledge, unless there's been an accidental meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| that body has not met since the Urban Growth Boundary Plan was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| And lack of upholding the duties of those meetings in no way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| I think it casts serious doubt about the validity of our existing Urban Growth Boundary Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7748)|
| 2:09:16| because that was mandated in the statute that the committee meet every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| The committee has not met, should have met five or six times since then, and has not met during that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7762)|
| 2:09:32| Who has the ability to call this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| The three mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7776)|
| 2:09:37| Isn't it the three mayors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| Does it have to be all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| I think it has to be the three mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Can we get on track with the motion and then discuss the fix after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7783)|
| 2:09:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Just a quick question for Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| Mr. Seymour, is there a chance this place could be called Brantleyville or Brantley Acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| I'm going to defer to Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Mr. Hickey, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| The home is being preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| Well, it should be a museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| We could leave the museum for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Sir, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7819)|

| 2:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| We haven't come up with a name yet, but I'll definitely take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Did you want to make a substitute motion that we don't approve this until they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| Seeing no further discussion, motion is before us to approve as per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7843)|
| 2:10:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Item 2-C-17-RZ is a request of R2R Studio LLC for rezoning from a agricultural and PC plant commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7861)|

| 2:11:35| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| The Planning Commission approved on consent the request to change the zoning to OB and recommends that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| Motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| As I spoke to you earlier today, Mr. Osborne, it's impossible by our rules to act without the applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7909)|
| 2:11:57| That's why we moved you from last month to this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is before us is to approve this rezoning per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7921)|
| 2:12:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7932)|

| 2:12:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| Madam Clerk, does that conclude our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| The business of the Zoning Commission has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Could I request that the Chairman write a letter to our delegation, the leader of our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7947)|
| 2:12:34| to ask for an Attorney General's opinion on the correct means to fix the urban growth within the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7954)|
| 2:12:43| Mr. Law Director and Mr. Law Director, could you restate your request again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| For us to ask the delegation chair to request an opinion of the Attorney General in regards to the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| A letter will be drafted for the signature of the Chair of Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get into the discussion during the process there, but we had Arthur Seymour on somebody else's dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7984)|
| 2:13:13| Well, and Mr. Hickey, Brian Hickey with Ball Homes will be happy to discuss with you at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7993)|
| 2:13:19| the problems they have run into because of the urban growth boundary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=7999)|
| 2:13:26| I just wonder if we could simply start, before we start with our state legislators, just ask our local mayors to reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8006)|
| 2:13:35| I mean, you could try, whatever, but we can't ask the state attorney's opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| If they haven't convened, is it still a legitimate law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| And so if it is, let's reconvene. If not, let's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| Mr. Law Director, seeing that the consensus of the Commission members to ask for an opinion of the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| that this three-member body, having not met its legislative requirement, is it still a valid committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8035)|
| 2:14:08| We understand the question, and we will have to submit it to the state through a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8048)|
| 2:14:15| The county cannot request an Attorney General opinion, but we will get one for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| Thank you, Mr. Law Director. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| On this letter, I think he said something about the state looking at the urban growth boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8066)|
| 2:14:35| And specifically, we're just going to ask for Knox County. That's all we're going to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| I thought I heard it was in a way that it was asking them to redo the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| But that three-year purpose, I was on that committee when they decided to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8086)|
| 2:14:53| and we asked this question last year at one time, and so we didn't get anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8093)|
| 2:15:01| So we're going to just make sure, with what was said by Brad, and I may have misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8101)|
| 2:15:12| we're just asking for Knox County only for them to see if we still have to abide by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8112)|
| 2:15:21| or can we change the rules within our county? Is that what you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| By not abiding by the urban growth boundary here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| There are two separate actions taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8130)|
| 2:15:35| Okay. And?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| The question that was asked by Commissioner Anders was if we could contact the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8139)|
| 2:15:51| Is that correct? To change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| And the other direction that is being approached is to ask through a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8157)|
| 2:16:03| if the Attorney General will determine that this body is or is not meeting its legislative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8163)|
| 2:16:14| if it still exists, because it's not been doing what it's supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| So the process is contact the state first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| No, these are both happening at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| I would also like for this commission to consider passing a resolution asking the Mayor of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| the Mayor of Knox County, and the Mayor of the City of Knoxville to reconvene this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| If we go to the state legislature, it's going to take another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| The Attorney General, that could take a little while too, a month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| And if it comes back that their lack of meeting and calling meetings has no bearing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8213)|
| 2:16:59| we're dealing with legislation that is, how old, Dan, was the last time this thing was updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| I think it was in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| 2000. So we're looking at 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| Knox County has changed, and we're going to wind up eroding a lot of property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| on land that we could get more yield out of if we don't act on this fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| It's an issue that I would request you, if you wish to sponsor a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| you contact the law department to get that resolution request to submit to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8245)|
| 2:17:34| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Dan, let's say the mayors convene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| What's the process they have to go through with you to allow more than three an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8259)|
| 2:17:45| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| Well, to designate within the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| expand the planned growth area would probably be the easiest thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| because right now the density limitation is in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| But to get to that point, when this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| and if Commissioner Bussler was on the original growth plan committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| it took a year and a half to get through where everyone would agree where the boundaries were at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8291)|
| 2:18:20| Now, I don't know if the cities, Farragut and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| I don't know what their incentive is at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| given a lot of it, as Arthur said, had to do with annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| and given the changes in the law dealing with annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| I don't know why they would really feel the need to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Dan's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| The laws have changed on annexation and the growth patterns of these cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| I don't believe they, under current state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| are allowed to move beyond their borders without voluntary annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| so their incentive to try and keep areas how they wish for it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8338)|
| 2:19:05| is not nearly as great as it used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| and it doesn't really affect them nearly as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| because many of those two entities' land is already fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| That is one reason why they probably are not willing to come back to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| It doesn't affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| But if we explain to them how much it's affecting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| and that we're not looking to change anything of theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| perhaps we can get them to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| Are there other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| I had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Sorry to keep you all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| But we have talked in the past about zoning and designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8373)|
| 2:19:41| and uses on reviews for certain type of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| I'm just wondering what we're going to do with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| because we do have, as Dan's aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| we have a lot of different type of facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| for different types of treatment out there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| that we don't have classifications for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| and I think we need to get ahead of this before we get way behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8398)|
| 2:20:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| Was he going to answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| He was going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| Well, if you recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| if you recall when the rezoning came up down on Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8419)|
| 2:20:24| the direction that we received was to look at the zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| as it applies to that specific type of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| We are in the process of doing that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| but we haven't moved or at the present time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| we're not proposing to move anywhere beyond that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170424?start=8439)|
