| 0:22:00| and has granted another use on review at Centerpoint for additional 12 beds and 2400 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1320)|
| 0:22:09| addition for outpatient services, and they are always full. It's no wonder when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| began to look for some place to expand and found a relatively inexpensive property right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1336)|

| 0:22:30| The plan is to add additional 15 CSU beds to a facility that the city, the county, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| the state would agree to fund if Helen Ross McNabb would agree to provide 16 beds for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| a jail diversion facility, and that's on RFP page 8. Is everybody happy? I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1362)|
| 0:22:52| no. The citizens in this community are not happy with another attempt to classify a non-hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| facility as a hospital. Even Helen Ross McNabb admits that Centerpoint is a non-hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| facility. Please reference page 14 of the RFP, and I quote, the CSU is a non-hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1387)|

| 0:23:39| when can we reasonably expect when 5, 10, 20 years go by? From now, there will be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1419)|

| 0:24:00| can, and you should stand for what is right today. We implore you, please do not allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| this facility that is in the arm of the judicial system that requires armed officers to enter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1447)|

| 0:25:21| It is clearly not. The primary function of this experimental pilot facility is not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1521)|

| 0:26:38| will be minimal and confined to first aid. The primary intended use is clearly to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| on mental health, alcohol, and drug addiction. Not only is this facility not a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| it is not clearly defined in our current zoning ordinance. We can gain more insight by reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| Peter Aaron's comments at the BZA hearing, which was a scattered, confusing ordeal. Kristen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| Grove was unprepared and confused throughout the hearing, stating at one point, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| have I totally screwed this up? Yeah. Okay. An opponent of our appeal was allowed to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| during the designated time for proponents. He made no mention of a hospital, just his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| personal opinion on the matter. Charles Van Beek made a motion to approve our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1640)|
| 0:27:28| Daniel Dupree moved to second the motion before taking back his vote, obviously confused and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| distracted by the ongoing chaos. David Odle seemed frustrated and annoyed by the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| and demanded an explanation from Mr. Van Beek. They even had Mr. Seymour confused, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| with the experience he has, I'm sure that's hard to do. No offense to you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| Mrs. Grove put her personal stamp on the ordeal with her closing contradictory statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1674)|
| 0:28:03| This is a great facility. Our ruling has nothing to do with our personal opinions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| However distracting and hard to follow it was, Peter Aaron's did provide some insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| on the fact that this proposed jail facility does not fit in our current zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| from his opening statement at the BZA hearing. And so the first thing I did was go and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1700)|
| 0:28:28| at the different medical facilities that are outlined in the definitions. And the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| one that allows for inpatient care would be a hospital. Everything else, as defined in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| there, it clearly didn't fit. So that's the direction I headed, that it appeared to function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| like a hospital where there's overnight care provided, there's a nursing staff there. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| also looked at the history of the adjacent property that had a use-underview for essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| the same function and the same use. Mr. Vagner's comments were, quote, it's a treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1734)|
| 0:29:06| and I think that's where the terminology hospital comes into play. Back to Mr. Aaron's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| it appeared to function, essentially the same function, make it fit, the only option. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| this sound like someone who's confident in their opinion or decision? He goes on to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| light on this and direction the council needs to take. He stated, I can't create new definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| That would have to go through MPC, through council, to create additional definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1773)|
| 0:29:40| This is not about your personal preference or opinion. This is not about your political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| agenda or what you stand to gain in your political career. Each board or council that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| presented to has shown a clear bias and has given in to political pressure and political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| popular opinion. This includes Gerald Green and MPC who sidestepped their duty and obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| to our citizens and community by approving the use-underview and stretching the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| regulations. They are intended to protect the value and integrity of our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| and property owners. Instead, they've been manipulated for political gain. We are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| you to approve our appeal by mandating the MPC to clearly define the jail diversion facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| which would create a new zoning so that Mr. Peter Aaron's can make the appropriate determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Thank you, sir. Now, Ms. Barbara Cook. Please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1830)|
| 0:30:40| and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Good evening. My name is Barbara Cook and I have lived for 24 years proudly at 4221| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville. I have parsed my words very carefully. I hope I stay within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| the five minutes but I respectfully request that if I go 30 seconds over, you'll give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| me a break. As you know, we are here this evening requesting that you overturn the ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| in the Board of Zoning Appeals to uphold an interpretation by the Chief Building Official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| of the City of Knoxville. We are also requesting that you overturn the interpretation, specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| the interpretation that the proposed use of the property at Deline Road is an experimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| jail diversion center and it can and should be considered a hospital even though such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| use is not covered in any published code definition or ordinance. It is really most unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1898)|
| 0:31:47| that existing code definitions and ordinance do not cover the intended use and most unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| that the Chief Building Official is put on the spot to try to shoehorn a size 10 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| into a size 8 shoe. It is also extremely unfortunate that for whatever reasons, the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| Appeals feels compelled to rely on the Building Official's shaky interpretation. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| we consider it very fortunate and just that we have the recourse of appealing to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| body for logical and reasonable solution. It is our hope and conviction that this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1948)|
| 0:32:38| will recognize that they have been given this role for a reason. Among them, that human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| beings are fallible and that placing such grave responsibility with such tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| impact into the hands of one person is not reasonable and can be unfair. It is especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1973)|
| 0:33:04| unfair considering the lack of comprehensive code definitions or ordinances to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| him. We recognize that considering this appeal will not be easy. It will require each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| you to separate yourselves from outside influences. You must not consider any of the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2000)|
| 0:33:30| who have been involved in this process so far. You must not consider whether the ultimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| use of the property is potentially worthwhile and noble. You must not consider that overturning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2018)|
| 0:33:47| this interpretation is a reflection on the job done by either the Building Official or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| the BZA. Your decision cannot be and is not a reflection of what you think of them, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2034)|
| 0:34:04| rather what makes sense. Please clear a place in your thinking, a place where only logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2044)|
| 0:34:13| resides, not emotion. Now, if you have that place, imagine a building to where individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2053)|
| 0:34:22| are brought in a squad car accompanied by an armed peace officer. Locked rooms inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| the building where the occupants are kept under some level of surveillance by an armed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| peace officer during their entire stay. And finally, individuals being escorted away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2076)|
| 0:34:45| the building in a squad car accompanied by an armed peace officer. I can't imagine there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| is any way that such an image conjures up an image of a hospital, or for that matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| ever could. And this is the crux of the matter. The use of this building is not a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| It is an extension of the justice system. Call it what you will, but it is not a hospital. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2109)|
| 0:35:18| this, and you know that we know you know this. So there you have it, plain and simple logic. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2118)|
| 0:35:27| implore you, we challenge you to stand up for what is right and overturn the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| placed on the use of this property. It is the right thing. It is the just thing. Please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2135)|
| 0:35:43| do not disregard the reason you have been given this responsibility. Do not let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| zoning codes be manipulated at the cost of citizen property owners. Support our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you very much. Thank you, ma'am. Okay, now we'll hear from the respondent, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2157)|
| 0:36:07| Mayor, members of council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| I am here on behalf of Helen Ross McNabb Center. I think shortly you all will hear from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| Seymour, perhaps on the basis of his decision, and maybe Attorney Cook Rowe from the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| Law Department, both of whom testified at the Board of Zoning Appeals. The issue before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| you tonight is a very narrow issue. This is the second appeal to this body regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2193)|
| 0:36:43| approval by the Metropolitan Planning Commission earlier in the year of this facility by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| city for use as a hospital facility. And the narrow issue is, what is the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2209)|
| 0:36:59| under the City Zoning Ordinance of a hospital? It's not state law. You don't look to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| definition. You look to the City Zoning Ordinance definition of a hospital. Mr. Aarons correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2226)|
| 0:37:16| interpreted this facility as a hospital, and the Board of Zoning Appeals did, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| we are asking you to do the same. The use on review that was earlier appealed to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| was predicated upon this facility being a hospital. For some reason, with no time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2251)|
| 0:37:40| on an appeal, the appellants chose to wait several months to bring this issue to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| Board of Zoning Appeals, and now to you, after the matter was originally heard by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Commission. In the meantime, Helen Ross McNabb has continued on with its plans with its architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| Barbara McMurray, to develop plans. They are now in the permitting stage with the Plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2282)|
| 0:38:12| and Codes Department here at the City, and intend, if you all will uphold the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| of the Board of Zoning Appeals, to commence construction on this facility in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| I have with me here today as resources Mr. Jerry Vagneer and Mr. Houston Smeltzer with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| the Helen Ross McNabb Center, who will be happy to address any specifics you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| about what the program will be at this facility on DeWine Road. But it very clearly, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| Ahrens determined very early on, that the facility meets the definition contained in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2328)|
| 0:38:57| the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance of a hospital. Thank you, unless you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| questions for Mr. Smeltzer or Mr. Vagneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you. We'll get to questions in a minute. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Okay, and now Mr. Ahrens. Where is Mr. Ahrens? He would come up and speak to the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2350)|
| 0:39:20| Good evening. Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| You know, to reiterate, when this was brought before me, obviously not everything can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| articulated in the current zoning ordinance. The primary function of this facility is medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| related, and when talking with Helen Ross McNabb, I realized that folks were staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| overnight on average of three days. So I needed to find a location within the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| that allowed for inpatient care. And that is the primary function, as described to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| of that facility. O-1 fits the bill. Well, not O-1, but defining it as a hospital fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| the bill, and O-1 allows that as a use on review. That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2404)|
| 0:40:14| Thank you. If there's questions, I'm sure they'll ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Okay, so now there's actually a two-minute rebuttal. Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| Mr. Zimmerman, would you like to do up to a two-minute rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| I just have a few quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| The timing of the appeal, as far as I understand it, and Mr. Frost would know more than I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| as far as that goes, that would be settled at Chancery Court. Am I right in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| I don't see that anybody can make that decision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Well, first, I haven't been asked to review this, but he ultimately, I believe this gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| would have the ability to, depending on the outcome of counsel's vote tonight, to file suit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| I could be wrong, but I'm thinking what was being referenced is Mr. Aaron's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| I'm sorry, just the timing? I wasn't talking about anything else except the timing was brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| that our appeal was not at the proper time. I'm just speaking on the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| Talking about what Mr. Seymour said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Yes, yes, to Mr. Seymour's comments. I'm just asking about timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| That just doesn't seem relevant here. No one here can make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| No, I think, and one of you all can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| did Mr. Seymour, were you talking about the timing of the appeal of Mr. Aaron's determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| that the hospital was, that this proposed facility met the definition of a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Was that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| And it was taken after. It was taken after an appeal was taken on the use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| which dealt with location of the facility, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| But that use-on-review was predicated upon Mr. Aaron's interpretation of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| as being a hospital under the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Mr. Seymour and I have not discussed this, but I think where he was going towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| because he had mentioned that they were moving through the permitting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| is that once things get far on down the road and spending money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| I refer to this because we've had litigation involving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| that a party has what are called vested rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| And at some point, this isn't a legal term, the cow gets out of the barn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and the process has gone on down the road where I think what Mr. Seymour was trying to say was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| it would be then the appeal might be too late in his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| You can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| It's just an opinion. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Well, the vested right concept is, well, it's not an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| There's a vested right act in Tennessee law, which I don't have in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| but after certain things are done and things have been granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| that yes, it can become, a party can have vested rights in what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2589)|
| 0:43:18| But you could, depending on how things go tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| you could go out and file suit in Knox County Chancery Court tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| Mr. Swanson would like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| I would just, I want to make sure that counsel is not confused about what your obligation is tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| There is not a legal argument before you at this time that this appeal was not timely filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2618)|
| 0:43:45| so that you would find that this appeal has no merit in that it is not timely filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| That is not an argument that you need to address tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| The argument you address tonight is whether or not the chief building official was correct or incorrect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| in determining that this particular use was a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Moreover, with regard to the vested rights issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| that's a legal issue that may be considered by the court if this matter comes before the court at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| You are not being asked tonight to decide whether or not the vested rights doctrine will apply to this case or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| That will be somebody else's decision to make at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| So you're just being asked to determine whether or not the chief building official's interpretation of the code is the correct interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| Okay, so Mr. Zimmerman, your rebuttal time is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| but I'm sure there will be more questions as we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| I spoke about 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| I just have two more comments if I could finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| I spoke about 20 seconds out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Yeah, you know, my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| I allowed you to ask a question, and typically that's not done in the rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Okay, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Without objection from counsel, that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| Just based on, real quickly, thank you for clearing that up, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| The comments that Peter Aarons made, again, medical-related, inpatient care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| that goes back to the other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| It's just not a clear definition to me and not a clear reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Okay, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Zimmerman, Mr. Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| and others who have been here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| This has been a long road to get to this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| I've reviewed the record, including the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| with Mr. Zimmerman's appeal of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| I've also reviewed the record from the BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| as well as the memorandum from Peter Aarons, the city's chief building officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| Taking all these things into account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| I believe that Mr. Aarons' interpretation of the proposed facility as a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| is the correct determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Therefore, I support Mr. Aarons' interpretation and move to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Okay, we have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Mayor, I want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| I want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I'm just stating that we have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| and now we will have discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| I'm going to have a discussion on the merits of this issue that's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| including whether we approve or deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| First, I would say I remember back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| So this is our normal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| We are following normally, and you can speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| It sounded like we were rushing to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I want to be sure that we have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| I properly state there's a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Now we have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| First, I remember when this was before us in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| and one of the things that came up was the community, the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| was talking about whether Mr. Aaron's opinion was correct or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| and it turned out, if my memory is accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| that technically they had not appealed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| and Mr. John Zimmerman was there, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| we actually have papers in our hand, but we didn't get around to doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| and we urged them to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| and challenge the decision of whether or not it was a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| so we could decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| So I think it is properly before us, but maybe that's not their view there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| What strikes me as critical here is that they want to put a very good facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2842)|
| 0:47:30| but it is an alternate jail facility where they try to treat the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| as opposed to incarcerate them in a cell for drug addiction, mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| some other condition, alcoholism, intoxication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| And the problem is that they're relying on a code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| and the problem of Mr. Aaron's is he's relying on a code section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Office 1, that is geared towards an office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| that was intended to bring medical, dental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and those kinds of services to residents in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| We are sitting surrounded by an R1 residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| and in there they are bootstrapping their way into a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| which is more akin to a jail treatment facility for these addictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| Is it a good idea that we do this? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Is it a good idea that we do it in the midst of a residential neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| And I submit to my colleagues it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| If you look in your packet, you'll see that Sheriff Jimmy Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| on page 483 in the packet, wrote a letter in support of this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| and he said they're trying to break the cycle of criminal justice involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| to reduce jail bed days, to increase treatment options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| and to reduce reentry into the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| That's all well and good, and we probably need to do this in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| but do we need to do it in the middle of a residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| where folks are there trying to raise their families and live their lives out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| And my concern is that we have tortured the word hospital because there is treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2953)|
| 0:49:21| apparently minimal according to the answer that was given in the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| but there is treatment of prisoners in this environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| That's not the idea that's in Office 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| which is to allow services that are needed by the community like medical and dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| and those things to happen near and in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| And we have taken a much more, what, stringent and, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| impactive use and shoehorned it into this category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2989)|
| 0:49:57| I appreciate the motive of everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| I think everyone's well-intentioned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| I'm concerned, and I think we need a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| but I'm concerned that we're trying to put it in a place it doesn't belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| and I'm going to urge my colleagues to challenge and overturn Mr. Averin's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| It's not really a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| You can't walk in there and get treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| You can't go to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| You've got to come in a cop car because you've been charged with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| or a judge has to send you over from court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| because he thinks you're better off getting some mental health treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| than sitting in a jail cell and being a recidivist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I just think that we have gone too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| in trying to stretch the definition of hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| to cover something next door to a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| I think it's impactive to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| I think it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Any other discussion from counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| All right, we have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3052)|
| 0:51:01| So I was questioning whether it had to be roll call, and it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Tell us what that means so we don't screw up our vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| What are we denying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| The motion is to deny the appeal of Mr. Zimmerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| So that we're affirming Mr. Averin's, in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| If you vote aye, you're affirming Mr. Averin's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I hear eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| So the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| The one, I can tell you, the one is Mr. DelVolpe is the one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| The others were ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| The neighborhood issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| All right, so the motion passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| It's a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| 11A is a resolution honoring the memory of Nakeshi Ayanaku,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| and to express city council condolences to her family upon occasion of her passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| I'd like to invite any of the members of Nkeke Ayanaku's family who are here to come down to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3126)|

| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Whereas Nkeke Ayanaku passed away on June 1, 2017, at the age of 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| and whereas Ms. Ayanaku was a native of Gary, Indiana, moving to Knoxville in 1988,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3175)|

| 0:53:19| and whereas through African American Appalachian Arts Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3199)|

| 0:53:30| and whereas Ms. Ayanaku produced the Kumba Festival in Knoxville for 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3210)|

| 0:53:54| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| the Council of the City of Knoxville wishes to honor the life and achievements of Nkeke Ayanaku| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| and to express to the members of her family its sincere condolences upon the occasion of her passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3246)|
| 0:54:15| Upon adoption, the City Recorder is hereby respectfully requested and directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| to forward a true and correct copy of this resolution to the family of Nkeke Ayanaku| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3261)|

| 0:54:33| Resolution shall take effect from and after its passage, the welfare of the city requiring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| and if the members of her family would like to speak, now is the time for you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Please identify yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| I am Toa Ayanaku. I need to say my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Hm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| I need to say my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| You need the address for that? Sure. Probably for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| 3140 Martin Luther King Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| And who's with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| My sister, Taki Ayanaku, she's at 2725 Winfield Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| and my nephew, Ojo, and my niece, Nkeke Ayanaku, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| Thank you for inviting us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I appreciate the honor that you've bestowed on my family by recognizing my mother and her contributions to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| She was not only a leader for the African-American community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| she's a leader for the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| She called Knoxville her home, even though she wasn't born here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| but she definitely held Knoxville in her heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| We talked many, many hours over the years, thousands of hours probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| about the new reality of this country and this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| and one of her dreams was to make Knoxville a better place for not only African-Americans but for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| Sometimes you hear people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| what's wrong with the black leadership of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Or what's wrong with the black leadership of America?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| We should never say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| That is a very derogatory term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| That's one of the biggest things that we talk about sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| is that there is no black or white leadership, there's just leadership in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| This council represents Knoxville, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| Not black, white, yellow, green, or whatever color, or ethnicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| If you are a city council person, or a mayor, or a county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| any kind of city official, we, all human beings, expect you guys to fight for our best interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| And I thank each and every one of you for doing that, if that's what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| I was born on December 22nd, 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| I was a gift to my mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| She was born on the same day, in 1956.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| So we really cherish and honor our mother for all the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| and all the things that she's done for this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| and all the seeds that she's planted in this city and within us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| One of her dreams was to make sure the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| each individual citizen and council person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| anyone who had power to change the city, to do it on the level of humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| Do it not because the numbers say, yeah, that's a good idea to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| because the number reflects something that we need to do for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| But do it out of the kindness of your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Do it in the reflection of equality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Do it because this country is based on representing all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| In terms of special events, do cultural activities for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| In my opinion, I think we should make it a priority to represent everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| Because this is America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Thank you all for inviting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you all for honoring my mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Hopefully I will be able to have a conversation with you all in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| just about whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Thank you all for representing Knoxville to the best of your ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| And I have faith in this system, and it can work if we all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3486)|

| 0:58:43| the city of Knoxville. Of course we'll see each other in Kroger or the co-op or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| at the next festival so thank you again. And my kids are bringing each, giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| gifts of the, of this year's Koomba Festival's advertising book. So it was so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| beautiful. Everybody came together even though June 1st hit us pretty hard, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| we were back on our feet and back into the flow. So thank you again. So we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| getting ready for next year. Thank you very much. And now we need a motion. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3554)|

| 1:03:44| I would, on this, you know, to pause a little bit and think about this. In 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| the City Council prior to us voted not to allow and ban all new EMCs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| Knoxville. There was less than 50 EMCs in Knoxville at the time and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| existing EMCs were grandfathered in and as long as you don't change the cabinet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| you can press on. But that City Council decided at the time that EMCs were a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| distraction, that they were not representative of our city, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| were not in the best interest of our city and they banned them forever. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| I'm not challenging that decision but I'm challenging that here we are, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| City of Knoxville is spending money to extend the life of an EMC for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| ten years for something that a council has decided that it's not in the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| interest of the city to have them. Private businesses can't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| Private businesses, if you change the use or tear the building down, you can't put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| it back but we can spend $125,000 putting the guts back in this site. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| new lights, everything but the cabinets, brand new. I think if SMG wants to put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| up it benefits SMG more than it benefits our city and they're not allowed. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| a reason why they're not allowed and I support that they're not allowed but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| don't support us the city putting money into an EMC that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3918)|
| 1:05:26| legal but it's a non-conforming sign and it does have a life of probably less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| than ten years. So I'd pause there and think about that. I think it benefits SMG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| more than it does us. The people that go on that or anybody that uses the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| Convention Center, they use it in their marketing agreement to say we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| Lego conference here and you know or we have a wedding or we have some deal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| there may be of some value to that. I don't think it's their value is not near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| as great as it was ten years ago and I would you know push the pause and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| know think about that a little bit. So I'm not gonna, I can't support it. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| you. I just want to make a point for Council. SMG is under contract. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3966)|
| 1:06:12| city facility. They have a budget to work within. It is to our advantage when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| perform well. So they do not benefit as SMG. The city benefits from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| facilities. I just want to make that clear. It's not a private venture that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| benefiting. It is our public facilities, our revenues that are benefiting. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| sell it as part of their marketing. I mean they get to sell as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| come do come have your you know rent our space and it makes it part of that rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Right but that's not where they're making their revenue. I mean that's us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| that benefits us just to be clear. Okay. Who's next? Mayor Grieve. Thank you. Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you. Wow. Do I get your office tomorrow morning? Sure. Wait a minute. I'll tell you which days I want you in my office. Some days are better than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4014)|
| 1:07:07| Depends on tonight, right? Or several weeks from now. Anyway, I was on City Council at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| the time that this came up and I would really, if Mary could remember, kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| give a history of what happened and why there was a lot of controversy over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| George, a lot of us on Council were really concerned. In fact, I think several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| of us voted against it at the time because of what you said. In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| we felt that the city should be the example and some of us lost out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| But I would like for Mary to kind of give a history you probably remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| more than any of us in terms of what happened and why and why it was finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| passed if you would do that. Mary Bogert, Knoxville Convention Center, 701 Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| Street. To the best of my recollection, back when the ordinance was changed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| 2009, we ended up going before City Council. We stood to lose several clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| due to the loss of the marquees. They use it, in particular our public shows, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| attract people to the building to be used as a wayfinding avenue. It went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| before Council. If I recall, it passed Council. It was appealed by Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| I believe, and then we went before the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| Design Review Board, and they upheld Council's approval of us keeping the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| marquees. At that time they also went a step further and removed any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| restrictions on operating guidelines that we had on the marquee. At that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| though, at the request of the City, we did increase our static hold. We went from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| six seconds to eight seconds. We agreed to reduce the lumens so that it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| obnoxiously bright. We agreed no blinking, no flashing, no animation. So that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| way that we felt that we were coming to the table to be, you know, reasonable, good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| advocates on behalf of a compromise. In any case, and I think that in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| seven years since that time, we have operated the marquees tastefully and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| professionally, and we've had no issue with regard to complaints or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| So I also want to let you know it's not, it's more, we're keeping more of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| marquee. We're replacing the screen, true. Other parts that stay are the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| conditioning units, the wiring, the computer system. An upgrade of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| software is included, but it's just the screens that we are wishing to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| that have been running for 17 years. I also want to point out too that even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| since that time, we now cut the marquees off at midnight and they're off from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| midnight till 6 a.m. That started about six years ago, but that was really more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| of a cost savings than part of the guidelines that we agreed to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| under at that time. I had just a quick conversation with Mary and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4203)|
| 1:10:11| question I brought up, and I think we brought this up nine years ago or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| whenever it was, is whether or not, since we do require those folks in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| that have been grandfathered in, I think the relay time is one minute, and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| or not you all could go up to 60 seconds or whether you could go to 30 seconds. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| do know that there are some issues in the sign ordinance that hopefully before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| some of us go off council that we're going to be able to tweak, but that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| one of the questions that I did pose to Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Are you talking about the error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| You better hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Some of us. That I did pose to Mary in terms of whether or not they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| extend their time instead of the eight seconds is whether or not you could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| up to 30 seconds or even higher on that. That was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| I was going to say, I don't think that's what we're here to talk about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I don't think that's what we're here to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| No, we're not. That's why I was saying this is something that may come up with a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Right, so we're not going to talk about it tonight, but it's something that he's asking her to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| The biggest investment we have in the city, we work very, very hard to try to sell the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| You guys know the economic impact numbers, and I know Mary's getting ready to send out another report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| that she and I just reviewed the other day, and we also know that we rely on that marquee a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| to help us sell the events that we do have at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| It's very, very important for Mary and her team and Visit Knoxville in selling the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| I think that Vice Mayor Grieve somewhat answered his own question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| It wasn't just a real cordial, nice, friendly evening that night that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| That's a nice way to put it, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of discussion, and I think exactly what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| that was the compromise at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| They have lived up to that, what they said they would do, because we're all by there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| and we don't remember that cordial, lovely evening so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| But they have done what they said they were going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| and I think the city is being an example by upholding what was promised at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| And we mentioned the marketing part of it, but I think you need to, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| to go a little bit more in detail as to how important that is to actually signing contracts with clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| Well, it depends on the type of business you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Not so much for the conventions, that's only one use of the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| but we also do an awful lot of public shows in our exhibition halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| In fact, our exhibition halls are so busy that I'm very grateful that you passed the ordinance before this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| which is to renovate the KCEC, because our halls are booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| And our show promoters use those marquees as a way to advertise their show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| So if we don't have the marquees, they're going to have to spend more money with Lamar on billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| and that type of thing to bring traffic to their shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| So it's part of their marketing budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| So when you talk about impressions, in particular the marquee that's on Henley and Clinch gets an awful lot of impressions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| at least 35,000 impressions a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| That's very valuable to someone when they're considering whether or not they want the public to know about the Brick Universe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4404)|
| 1:13:31| or about the Dogwood Arts Festival, or about the Pink Bottle Show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| or any of the other public shows that we have in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| It's hugely impactful to their marketing budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| But is it actually a moving part in a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Can it be a moving part in a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| I mean, if we were to remove it, would it cost me to lease some of my public shows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| It would certainly be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| I would not want to have that conversation with those clients who have come to rely on it over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| I think Mr. Wallace makes a good point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| I think the issue is about fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| The Convention Center competes with a lot of local businesses for space, for events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4449)|
| 1:14:19| and those businesses are not allowed to have this type of sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| I mean, that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| I think it might make sense to postpone this two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| I mean, I would like to sort of look into the issue further and go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| I wasn't there that night in 2009 and perhaps watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| You didn't want to be there, I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| But I would move to postpone this issue two weeks to allow us to look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| because it is, to me, it could be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| I mean, I think that's probably what it was in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| It's an issue of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Honestly, businesses want EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| I mean, they attract eyeballs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| But like Councilman Wallace said, the council decided to ban them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| So private businesses, we want them to succeed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| They can't use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| So I think it's worth looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| So I'd make a motion to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| I'll second postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| Okay, so it's a motion to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| There was something you just said I wanted to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| When you mentioned that the convention center competes with others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| I would say that let's talk about who all the businesses that directly rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| convention center business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| I don't know if you want to address that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| What I would like to say is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| the convention center serves the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| It serves the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| And the very reason it was built was to drive economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| So that's driving business to the businesses in the downtown Knoxville corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| It draws business to our hoteliers, whom, yes, we do compete with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| We have a very good relationship with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| We also give our hoteliers business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| So I will tell you that our purpose there is to drive economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| And I think that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| I certainly agree, and I hope my comments weren't understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| I mean, I certainly think that you all are doing a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| and that's the role of the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| But I think for some events it does compete with other local venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| And there's a lot of venues that, you know, drive hotels and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4604)|
| 1:16:54| Just to draw the distinction, those are private venues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| This is the largest taxpayer-owned facility we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| Yeah, I mean, I think that's the discussion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| Councilman Starr is talking about should have been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| Gosh, how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| Well, no, before 2009, before we even built a convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| We built a convention center to be prosperous for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Now we're talking about working against one of the largest investments that the city has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| And it's an ongoing, it's a profit center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| I mean, not only the hoteliers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| but our restaurants and everything that we've invested in downtown directly downtown are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| You've got gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| It's the best money that comes into this city because it's got a multiplier effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| I'm not sure exactly what the multiplier effect is, but they don't tax our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| They leave behind the tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| And why we would want to go out and study whether we've made a good investment is just way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| that train left the station years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| So I'm not going to support any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| I just think it's unfounded thinking, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| It's not unfounded thinking, but I just don't agree with that thought process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| going to do anything against our convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| If I recall, when we had that friendly meeting about this some years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| when five of us were really green on council at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| the big concern was not competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| The big concern was that it would affect traffic going by and it would cause accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| And there are thousands of people who go by there every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| and accidents that occur are not connected to the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| And that was the biggest argument at the time, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| was that it was going to cause accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| It had been there, had not caused accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| It's not causing accidents since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| So I really think that looking at fairness to other venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| this is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| When I go downtown and I haven't looked at any of the print media about what's happening in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| and I see what's going on in the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| it makes me feel good that our tax dollars are getting a good return on that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| And to do something that would diminish that or reduce that, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| would be an unwise move on the part of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| Any other discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| So before us we have the motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| So that's two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Two to postpone, seven not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| We're now back to the original motion, which is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| That's 11K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| One no opposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4805)|

| 1:20:10| 11L is a resolution to authorize the Mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| and accept a grant award from the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| in the amount of up to $350,000 for the purpose of funding the replacement of the docks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| along Volunteer Landing at Calhoun's Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Mayor, I just want to say we're starting to get concerns by citizens who say that they live as part of a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4832)|
| 1:20:41| Let's finish the vote, and then I'll ask Christy to update you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Just where we are in this, because there's a big gap, I think, where we're not going to have service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| Because you're not speaking to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| You're just questioning the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Okay, let's stop for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Christy, would you address the concerns about the dock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| So we had actually closed a portion of the dock that had fallen into disrepair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| and I really should say that was the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| And then about, I guess it was weekend before this last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| we actually had an errant boat that hit the good portion of the dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| and unfortunately made all of the dock in very poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| The safety thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| Yeah, so for safety we decided we needed to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| We had it inspected, and we are actually, I think it was probably removed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| I know Chip and I talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| I don't think he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| So it's removed, and we are working to get the grant approved to be able to replace the dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| It is an involved process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| It does take longer than you would think it should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| because all we're really doing is sliding the same kind of dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| We are going to make it a little bit wider back into that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| But you do have to get Army Corps of Engineers and also TVA permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| So it is quite an involved process, even though we are going back into the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| Is there any such thing as a temporary dock that you just leave there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| No, TVA does not allow a temporary dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| You've got to go through the whole rigmarole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| You've got to go through the whole process. Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| So we are working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| We know that there's going to be some Ball Navy members who are not happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| but we have communicated with all of them and let them know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| And I know that we have been working with Visit Knoxville and with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| to try to create some other locations near the Ball Navy docks for people to tie onto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| We'll give them Bill Lyons' number when they call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| And yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=4952)|

| 1:24:45| Councilman Daliborzi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Yeah, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| I think I have gotten clarified today the discrepancies between the information sheet we were given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| and the details that Municap and others evaluated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| but there's a variance between 160 units in the information sheet versus 184 that Municap looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| There's a price of the project, $37 million, in the information stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| It's $40 million that was evaluated by Municap, and there's a couple other variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| The amount of the bank loan bumps up from $22 million to $24 million and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| and it turns out, as I understand it, and maybe someone can clarify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| that they're still trying to acquire parts of the old Park Bank building from a variety of owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| but to the best of my knowledge from what they've told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| the higher numbers are the correct ones if they get all of the pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| The only thing that's still a little screwy in there is we have the old tax rate as part of Municap's evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| and the next item on the agenda or somewhere close by is to bump that down to .24 from .27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| but I don't think it makes a great difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| Perhaps Dawn Michelle can just get us clear on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director in the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| Pretty much on point with what you were saying in regards to the variances of the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| because based on the number of floors that the property owner is acquiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| that's causing the discrepancy of the numbers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| In regards to the tax rate, when that changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| all that will be applied as the pilot application gets approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| and goes through the process with the city IDB based on the approval of the process here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| Mr. Alpesh Patel is here if you have any additional questions in regards to the pilot application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| and Mark Mametoff is here in regards to the third-party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| if you want to address any other questions with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| Well, I guess I just want to be sure that the third-party review is accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| in the sense we think the higher numbers that they used are going to be the basis for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| Maybe someone else can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| They will be the basis based on what Mr. Patel would acquire on those floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| Because it would change the internal rate of return and everything if you invest different amounts and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Is Mr. Mametoff going to wave the magic wand or something so we'll know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| Sorry, Mark Mametoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| We used larger numbers because it provides the better return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| Obviously, the more units you can do, it becomes more cost efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| So if we use the smaller numbers, then it will only make his return worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| And so we used the best-case scenario to determine that if things went well for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| would he still get – does the pilot still make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| In other words, would the return not be excessive for a developer to take it on without a pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| If we said you're going to do a smaller hotel, it will just drive his numbers down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| because his costs of construction are going to be higher for buildings, fewer units within the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| And so we used the higher numbers in the view that that was more conservative for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| the way to look at whether the pilot was needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Thanks for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5305)|

| 1:28:30| I think Mr. Patel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| I'd like to have him come up and tell us a little bit about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Good news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| To get this obviously this week, I've had a nice e-mail and conversation with you yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5317)|
| 1:28:45| and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Tell us a little bit about what you're going to do and what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| And it's going to look different because we don't have any of the renderings or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| And talk a little bit about the ingress and egress for the hotelers and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| And please start with your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Thanks for having me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| My name is Alpesh Patel, 247 Brook Valley Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| I can go on for a very long time about this development, so just let me know when to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| because we're very, very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Our plans are to take the old office building, which is in very tired condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5357)|
| 1:29:27| needing a big renovation, very low occupancy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| All but one tenant is on a month-to-month lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| And basically bringing life to that building, which we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| I mean, I grew up in Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| I went to elementary school at Sunnyview, middle school, high school at Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| basically the corner of Maine and Maine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| And it's just a shame right now that it's a building with the lights turned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| And so what we would do is convert it into an upper-upscale four-star Embassy Suites Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| And the ground level would have the signature Embassy Suites atrium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| because the building lends itself to that with the mezzanine level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| I have some kind of inspiration-type drawings where we would incorporate the basement level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| the main level, and the mezzanine level into one kind of massive atrium-style open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| that would have a living wall and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| The first floor, we're looking to have a local community bank that would lease out space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| and would have a headquarter in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| They're very, very aggressive in wanting a presence in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| We are looking at a local farm-to-table upscale-type concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| because I'm sure when you all travel at hotels, usually you don't want to eat at the hotel restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| So we want to bring in an outside restaurant company that can do a much better job for our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| We're looking at hopefully if we can squeeze in enough space into our first floor street-level area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| coming right off of Gay Street, having a coffee shop-type concept over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| that we would also potentially lease or do a joint venture with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| So those are the overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| And then also we would have 10,000 square feet of meeting space, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| We're still finalizing our plans, which we think would bring in more demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| So we're not just looking at taking business from other hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| We're hoping that this will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| I wish she was still here with the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| We're hoping that we have a letter of support from Visit Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| because there are so many more events that are being booked now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| The more hotel rooms you have within walking distance of the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| the easier a job it is for meeting planners to be able to book more events that we currently don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5516)|
| 1:32:05| Again, I can go over some more specifics that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| Talk about where the valet parking is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| You have no parking, so you're going to have to valet park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| and where they're going to unload and load the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| How are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Right now, unfortunately, the situation is that there's no parking that's associated with the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| that we have under contract, so there's just surface parking with about 20 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| We would hope in the future it's a bit of a complex ownership structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| to be able to get ownership of the surface parking lot that Regence leases out some spaces with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5559)|
| 1:32:48| in which case we would love to look at maybe building a multi-level parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| Right now, we've spoken to the owner of the 407 Walnut Street garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5573)|
| 1:33:03| a private garage, because we understood from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| that the public parking spaces are in very high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| We knew that from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| The owner said that they have plenty of spaces for us to lease out on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| The thing with urban downtown hotels is you don't need a one-to-one parking ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| You have more people that will fly in, take Ubers, or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5603)|
| 1:33:33| Embassy Suites is part of the Hilton family of brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Hilton standards are for urban hotels, you typically need 50% of your room count access for parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| For a 180-room hotel, we'd need about roughly 90 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| As far as ingress and egress, it would be a valet situation, so it would be valet only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5627)|
| 1:33:55| We'd be requesting, eventually when we get to that stage, a valet easement where guests can pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| The valet company can take the guest's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| The guests can go inside the hotel, check in, while we park their car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| Good. It's an aggressive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| The only downside is you're not going to do a facade change on it, except for the first floor and the canopy over the sidewalk and the mezzanine level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5655)|
| 1:34:30| The rest of the facade, the rest of the story is going to remain the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| We personally think, and our architects and designers really think, that it's a beautiful, classical building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5677)|
| 1:34:44| When we toured around the building, they were just amazed by the glazed fire brick and all these precast elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5684)|
| 1:34:56| I'm not an architect, but there was a lot of folks that really liked the look of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| I also wanted to mention our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| If it works out, the restaurant space would actually be on the mezzanine level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| so you'd be able to walk out to that cantilevered area on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| Our structural engineer came in and saw that there's opportunity to have outdoor seating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| so you'd be overlooking Gay Street, which we think would be really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| That's cool. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| Thank you. Vice Mayor Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| A couple of questions I have, and maybe Don and Michelle, you can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| The one is that you just got through saying if the plans work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| Let me back up and just say I'm a little disappointed that we just heard about this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| Other pilots and TIFs we've got, we generally get to see renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| We get to see floor plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| We have a better understanding of what the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| It's not to say that I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| I think it sounds like a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| I'm a little concerned about when you said if the plans work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| are there still some hoops you're having to jump?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| I'm questioning what those are before we go ahead and make the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| So what type of hoops are we still talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| We don't have a signed lease yet with the restaurant right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| so that's where I don't have it set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| We have tremendous interest from several different restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| but I cannot say right now that our plans are set where we have a signed lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| where the restaurant has agreed to go to the mezzanine space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| Do you have the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Do you have all the floors of the building tied up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| There's four separate owners of the building for the 13 floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| and the basement and mezzanine level, the entire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| So out of the four owners, we have three under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| and the fourth, we're in final, final stages of signing a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| and he's actually here, Larry Liebowitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5814)|
| 1:37:01| If I'm correct, I'm thinking that you'll have that closed maybe by the end of October?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Our plan is to purchase the entire building with all four owners by the end of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| What happens if we approve this and you're not able to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| Dr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| I'd like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Really, if council approves this and it doesn't happen, we're exactly where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| We're not at risk for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| The status quo will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| We'll still have a building with multiple owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| We have one here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| I won't speak for all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| but I think most agree it would probably be better to get a more unified ownership structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| for the future of the building that could be part of the reason that it's in this situation it's in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| So we are not at any risk whatsoever if you approve this and it doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| Is there a reason we have to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| I mean, without all the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| Yeah, because his whole financing package and everything depends on this to take to his bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| because the pilot is absolutely necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| So if you don't approve it, it just will stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| and I don't know what kind of time frame Mr. Patel is under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| but these things don't have unlimited horizons with them, the agreements that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| Are we doing this one a little bit different than we've done the others, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| the other people that have been to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| We've done quite a few with options prior to taking title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| In fact, we may have done more that way than with pure fee ownership, wouldn't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| We'd know my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Thank you, Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| So, council, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5922)|

| 1:39:11| She'd like to comment about what it is that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| You want to prolong the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Anybody who knows me knows I always love to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5954)|
| 1:39:22| The State Street Garage, thank you for your investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| It's going to get bigger and with the opening of the Farragut Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| Name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| You mean you don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Lisa Zeni, 113 Baylor Drive, Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| It's going to see a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| That pad in front of the State Street Garage is one of those places that cries out for public art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5983)|
| 1:39:52| And we're absolutely delighted with the design of the piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| It echoes both our proximity to the beautiful water and the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| And being white, it provides us a lot of opportunities to show light on it, to color it, and to change the colors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| It's going to be a very exciting and dynamic piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6009)|

| 1:40:16| 11S is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute any of the documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6016)|

| 1:40:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| 12A is an ordinance setting a certified tax rate as required by Tennessee Code Annotated Section 67-5-1701| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6046)|
| 1:40:54| and amending Ordinance O-97-2017 to adjust the tax rate from $7.7257 to $2.4638.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6054)|
| 1:41:07| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Councilman Dellavoti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Yeah, I don't know if Jim's here or not, but the basic idea is the rate floats once we get reappraisals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| so that we don't actually inadvertently increase taxes, but Jim can tell us a little bit more about that under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6079)|
| 1:41:28| Jim York, Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| What you have here is under state law any time there is a reappraisal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| the local government entity must pass what is known as a certified tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| which is the tax rate that would yield the same amount of money that you had last year adjusting for inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6103)|
| 1:41:55| Again, it's always gone down, and that's what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| So you don't use the appraisals to do a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| You end up leveling the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Under a certified tax rate, you cannot gain as a result of reappraisal in terms of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| It's a technical fix, in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| 12B is an ordinance to rezone property located on the east side of Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| south side of Thorn Grove Pike, north side of I-40, from C4 District to PC2 District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| Sconell Properties, LLC, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6156)|
| 1:42:43| Okay, I do have a few people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Do you want to hear before there's any motions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| We have speak in support of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| We have Chris Miller and Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| And just check me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| And to speak against the rezoning, we have Bob Wolfenbarger, Jason Long, and Ed Breed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| So we'll call the individuals in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Mr. Miller, is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Or, Arthur, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| I thought I'd signed up first, and then Mr. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| I thought I signed up Brian Fisher for third, if need be, but primarily for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| Is he on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Who is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Brian Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Brian Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| All right, so if you want to start, I'll set your name and address, and I'll put the timer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| This is a piece of property that we are asking for rezoning on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| which is in the northeast quadrant of Interstate 40 and Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6229)|
| 1:43:57| The property is in the city of Knoxville, obviously because of a strip annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| I think the line went out I-40 there to grab two quadrants at I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| As I understand, the annexation occurred probably back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| The property is zoned C-4 under the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| which is a general commercial zone that would allow a broad range of commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6261)|
| 1:44:30| which would include car lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| It's the broadest general commercial zone the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| It is an unplanned zone in that anybody who meets the description of the uses permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| can simply obtain a building permit to construct that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| as long as they meet the requirements, setback requirements, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| Our client seeks to operate a truck warehouse facility at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| When we first met with MPC and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| we obviously knew from reading the zone that it did not fit in the C-4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| Mr. Gerald Green and Mr. Dan Kelly with the MPC suggested PC-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| Planned Commercial 2, as the proper zone for the use and for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| Our clients were fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| We are here asking for PC-2 zoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| It meets the sector in the one-year plan, both of which are general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| It went before the Metropolitan Planning Commission and received unanimous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| Staff recommended it, and the MPC unanimously recommended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| The purpose is to put a truck facility there with warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| It is adjacent to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| There could not be a better location in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| The tenant is a large Tennessee corporation logistics company with air freight, ground freight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6366)|
| 1:46:14| and it would be their ground freight facility for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| There is already one located in Forks of the River, but they have outgrown the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| They see Knoxville as a major center for expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| and they do not have that expansion room at Forks of the River and seek to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| Now, I noticed Mr. Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| I saw him, spoke to him before the meeting, and I know he is here to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| He has raised legitimate issues about the soils, the rocks, and everything on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6403)|
| 1:46:52| These are the issues that come up all over the city of Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| anywhere in the southern Appalachian Valley we are fortunate to live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| and they will have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| After the zoning was approved by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| Mr. Gerald Green requested that the applicant and its engineers and developers meet with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| to discuss what would be expected in the next step of the process if we're successful in the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| that is, the use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| And he and I think Mr. Kelly was there at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| made very clear that one of the major issues was the terrain, sinkholes, karst, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6450)|
| 1:47:38| And our clients understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| They understand that they will have to work with the City Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, or TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| and these will be issues that will be subject to close scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| And they are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| They are preliminarily doing some work on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| but until the zoning is in place, we cannot tell you what the answer to these issues are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| But once, if you all approve the zoning, we will go back and start core drilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| and doing all the typical due diligence that a developer would do on a site like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6497)|
| 1:48:25| We will be buffering, of course, how much of the ground can be made impervious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| how you will handle stormwater, all the issues that go with a development of this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| I'm sorry, sir, your time is up. I didn't tell you your minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| But wrap it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| So let me say at this point, we are not prepared to answer specific questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| but we will have to before this facility can be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| and that will come at the use-on-review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| which is a public meeting at MPC and can be appealed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| We would ask for your support for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| The reason why I got distracted, I was trying to find your third person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| and we have a Brian Rollins. Is that your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| I'm sorry, I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| You said it wrong. Okay, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| And now who goes next, Chris Miller or Brian Rollins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| Mr. Miller and Mr. Rollins are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| They are with the development team and the engineering team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| They are here to respond to questions, but I guess you're in agreement with me, aren't you, Mr. Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| Good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| And they will be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| But they don't need to speak right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| They'll just answer questions when it comes to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Put your hand behind his back when you answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| So now those signed up to speak against this rezoning, Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| Are you going first, Jason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| Yeah, if we could switch the order up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| I think we accidentally signed out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| and I'm going to try and remember to tell you at one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| My name is Jason Long with Lowe, Yeager & Brown at 900 Gay Street, Suite 2102, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| I represent the 8th District Preservation Association in their opposition to this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| You've been handed some materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| We've tried to keep them as short and sweet as possible because I saw the size of the agenda package you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| and only wanted to touch upon what we felt were critical points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| We would like to make those materials part of the record, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| It sounds good to rezone a piece of property for planned development, and in this case from C4 to PC2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6646)|
| 1:50:56| but what is critical or what is of concern to those in opposition to this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| is that it is, in effect, what we consider to be an upzoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| a more intensive land use that is being proposed that would otherwise be permitted under a C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6666)|
| 1:51:13| In this case, as Mr. Seymour has indicated, the purpose of this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| the purpose of the PC2 zoning will be to allow a truck terminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| which is not otherwise allowed on the property at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| And there are good reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| The MPC has indicated and Mr. Green has indicated that they are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| and believe that PC2 is an appropriate zone for a truck terminal, and I question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6697)|
| 1:51:44| I'm not sure that I see that in the code, but if that be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| the idea that a truck terminal can go into this location is, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| upgrading this zone to what the applicants originally asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| and that is an I-3 industrial district, which would otherwise be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| or be used for the permission of truck yards and terminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| We have provided some relevant authority. One is the definition of that I-3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| but I'd like to refer counsel to the Knoxville-Farragut-Knox County Growth Policy Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6733)|
| 1:52:20| which indicates that hillside lands with pre-development slopes of 16% or greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| shall not be rezoned for industrial or commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| Lands with steep topography greater than 15% slope generally do not lend themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| to urbanization due to the high cost of engineering and development on severe slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| Development on severe slopes also creates problems with drainage, erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| water pollution, stream sedimentation, and aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| These are the growth policy guidelines that have been adopted by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| by the City of Farragut, and by Knox County to help determine and plan growth in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| These are the documents that our citizens rely upon and expect or hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| that our legislative bodies also rely upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| Further, the East County Sector Plan was adopted in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| Hillside ridge line protection areas prohibit commercial and industrial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| on hillsides greater than 15% and on ridgetops where pre-existing commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| or industrial zone property exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Consider zoning overlay incentives to reduce the extent impacts of future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6807)|
| 1:53:33| The overlay's purpose would be to reduce the amount of grading and clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| and the incentives would be to cluster the developments at the top of slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| I'd like to refer Council to, I think it's page 1062 of your agenda packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| which has the site plan for this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| As you'll notice, as proposed, the development takes up the entire parcel of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| It proposes essentially to use all of the available land on this particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| Now, if you look at the materials that I've provided you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| the first page after those general statements of law is the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| I'm going to have to speed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| The area that we're talking about is over by Midway Road and is within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| Next you'll see the topography map for the area itself, which shows a steep grade of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| the very type of grade that we're talking about when we talk about hillside and ridgetop protection plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| The next map I feel like I need to explain before my time gets cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| It has never been my intention to present to this Council an unmarked map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| but this is in fact the MPC map of slope for this piece of property that was requested by Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| He can speak to that if necessary and if it's necessary to supplement the record to show that that is actually the MPC slope map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6888)|
| 1:54:56| But what Council will see is that the majority of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| the vast majority of this property is either yellow, red, or brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| indicating slopes greater than 15% where industrial and commercial development is not supposed to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6903)|
| 1:55:11| This piece of property has been C4 for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6911)|
| 1:55:21| It has only had two billboards on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| That was the purpose of the C4 designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| and it has been utilized to justify the rezoning of a piece of property for a potential business park as one of the bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6926)|
| 1:55:35| And now that business park is being utilized as a justification for a reason for rezoning this parcel of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| and it's these type of ad hoc zoning decisions without adherence to the hillside ridgetop protection plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6942)|
| 1:55:50| and other plans developed by this body and by Knox County that lead to poor zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| With a long paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| I'm an attorney, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| Before he sits down, there's a difference between those two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| One talked about warehousing, which to me sounds like a building you store packages in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| and the other one talked about a truck terminal, and it sounds like big trucks come in and load onto other trucks and they go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| It's different than a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| Which is this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| Well, I'm going to have to defer to Mr. Seymour and his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| What I see in the MPC recommendation is freight terminal, and that can be interpreted a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| I can tell you that my client's concern is about heavy trucks coming in and out of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| As opposed to a building that stores packages in shelves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| Well, a building that stores packages in shelves is still going to have to provide significant access to heavy trucks to move those packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7005)|
| 1:56:52| So there still would be concern over that type of development, which is a reason that it's indicated for industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| Well, the reason I ask that is there's a word, warehousing, in PC2, but there's no truck terminal set as an allowed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| And that may be where there is confusion, because as I read PC2, I did not see freight terminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| and my understanding was, as indicated by MPC's report, that this was for the purpose of a freight terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| Thank you for the clarification. We'll hear from Mr. Seymour soon, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Bob, thanks for being here. State name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| Thank you, Mayor and Council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I particularly appreciate the opportunity to meet with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| and talk with the Council members that returned my calls and actually met with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| Robert Wolfenbarger, in this case, 8416 Kodak Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7062)|
| 1:57:49| An interstate term exit does not preclude an appropriate development site, and I think that's what we're trying to convey here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7069)|
| 1:57:57| The proposed development at Midway Road will require substantial modification of the natural function of the watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| resulting in some known and unknown consequences that will endanger the health and the welfare of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7083)|
| 1:58:11| We ask that you respect the water and the land and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| The site is currently over-zoned, from our perspective, for the geology and the topography of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| The United States Geological Survey, as you can see in the maps provided to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| and the NPC each stated that this site is located within a sinkhole drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7106)|
| 1:58:34| In the city, they call that a critical sinkhole watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| There are 17 of those noted by the U.S. Geological Survey in Norris County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| This is the second largest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| The first largest one is Ten Mile Creek, and of course, Prosser Road area is another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| just so you know what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| As proposed, the PC-2, which I prefer to refer to as it's being proposed right now, is PC-2.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7133)|
| 1:59:02| because you're asking for a modification to allow a truck terminal where it's not permitted use in PC-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7142)|
| 1:59:12| My apologies, I want to save some time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Obviously, time is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| The truck terminal proposal of rezoning request and the proposed PC-2 are individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| and collectively all in conflict with Knoxville and Knox County's development policy guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| as Jason said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| I'm sorry, just lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| As for zoning policy and obvious environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| it should not have been the responsibility of this community to bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| There was a reference made about 15-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| As you all see in your packet, none of this geological or topographic information is provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| no discussion whatsoever to the bodies that have considered this, including you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| We provided that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| That's a gross negligence on the part of NBC, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7199)|
| 2:00:06| As I said earlier, this particular proposal, we're concerned about the geology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| and how it's going to impact flooding and how it's going to impact our drinking water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| But we think that the zoning itself that's proposed is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| I'd like to reserve the rest of my time, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Now, Ed Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| Mr. Reed, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7236)|
| 2:00:37| My name is Ed Reed, and I reside at 435 South East End Road in Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| which is in the Foreign Growth Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| Our little farm is just a half a mile from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| We've lived there for many years and lived in an ancestral home, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7248)|
| 2:00:53| Our exit is 402 Midway Road exit off I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| Shortly after the Midway Road portion of I-40 was opened in December of 1974, that's 43 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| my father-in-law called me and informed me that property, this very property, was for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| and perhaps we should take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| So we found the property to be very, very steep and rocky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| Some parts were solid rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| And so it has been for 43 years with no development except for two billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| It's a wooded ridgetop that added the beauty to East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| A few weeks ago, three small orange signs appeared in front of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| that had been placed there by staff from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| Upon investigation, I found that there was a proposal being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| to develop the property for a freight terminal, which would remove all of the trees from Climb Knob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| as the ridge is named by the USGS topo maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| It's a named hill, or better known as Climb Knob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| It would require removal of about 200 feet of vertical hillside from the level of Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| over 200 feet high in some portions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| For a level spot to propose commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| And for any of you who may happen to all have your materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| if you have any questions about what was being planned, you can look in your packet page 1062,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| which shows a truck terminal with trucks and trailers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| 1062.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| It's not the material we just handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| It's in your materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| It's trucks coming in and taking stuff off and loading on other trucks and training like a UPS facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| I said to my wife, surely our city administration wouldn't let this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| So I decided that I would make it my own personal business to look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| So I actually purchased a copy of the Knoxville, Farragut, Knox County Growth Policy Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| and read every word of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| And it referred to the county sector plans, which I read every word of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| And it also referred to the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| which I read and tabbed every word of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| Now, the reason I'm telling you that is that they are all in consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| that properties over 12% in elevation slope should not be developed for industrial or commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7377)|
| 2:03:05| no matter what the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| That's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7388)|
| 2:03:09| So I was able to tell my wife, well, their own documents say they would never do this because it's so steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7389)|
| 2:03:15| Do you understand they'll have to cut down 200 feet of solid rock down to get it level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| haul it off somewhere, blast all that to pieces and make stream sedimentation problems and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| So what I found in the growth policy plan was hillside lands with pre-development slopes of 16% or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7406)|
| 2:03:34| Does everybody understand by looking at the pictures that some of this is 40% or greater, not just 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7414)|
| 2:03:41| It is also in the hillside and ridgetop protection plan, should not be developed commercially or industrially at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| It says it shall not be rezoned for industrial or commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| And then I also found in the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| which is one of your documents that you've approved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| that hillsides and ridge crests of 15% or more future development should be limited on hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7439)|
| 2:04:06| And then it says prohibit commercial and industrial development on hillsides greater than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| It doesn't say limit, it says prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| So my conclusion would be deny the request of these people to rezone and build a freight terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7453)|
| 2:04:22| because it's commercial and industrial development on steep land over 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| There's about anybody who looks at it, topographical map or these pictures or the hillside protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| all say that if this kind of land is developed at all, it should be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Residential or low-density residential of three acres or more just for houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7479)|
| 2:04:45| It's so rocky I don't think anybody would ever want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| but my guess is that if this property should not be developed this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7487)|
| 2:04:52| based on the growth policy plan, the East County Sector Plan, and the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| all of which this group has adopted as part of your standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| So thank you for denying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| Okay, Council, that's the end of the folks who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7506)|
| 2:05:11| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| You know, this is an interesting and difficult problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| What we have is a large commercial operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| It's probably FedEx because I know I've been to their facility on John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| and I know the one they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| I could imagine that that company thinks that it would save money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| and time to be close to an interstate entrance and exit ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| instead of driving through local roads to get to the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| and that time and gas are money, and I'm sure that adds up to big dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| The flip side is the question you must be asking yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| why is this the only interchange in this area that has not developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| And when you look at the number of sinkholes and the steepness of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| and the potential that the sinkholes take contaminated water from truck runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| and diesel fuel and whatnot into the groundwater and affecting the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| that's the other side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| Mr. Seymour has made a point, well, it's a little premature to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| because we're going to deal with that once we get the zone in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| We're going to sit down with TDEC and the water quality stormwater folks of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7593)|
| 2:06:40| and I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| You're not going to spend a million dollars on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| until you know if you're going to build there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| My concern is if we have these policies in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| so we don't have another flooding like Ten Mile Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| that took years and millions of dollars to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| and at least a million and a half or $2 million to fix Prosser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| are we asking for trouble when we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| Is this the only site they can use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| I mean, we don't know enough about the potential harm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| but when you look in that, I guess it's the third topographic map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| that's in there, blue line streams impacted by Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| If that intersection feeds all those blue water streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| that go through farmland into the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| are we doing some kind of harm that we really would want to avoid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| I mean, I think that's a significant question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| and I guess the question is when do we confront that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| If we send the camel halfway under the tent, can it ever back out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| And I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| I'm concerned that we could be damaging groundwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| making flooding conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| The flip side is I'm sure we're all concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| that we want to have a viable, healthy business here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| that pays taxes and employs people, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| I saw information in the packet that said they were going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| I'm going to guess, I think it was 200, no, 150 trucks per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| The 200 number was employees going in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| But it appears to be designed, looking at the bay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| so that trucks come in from various parts of the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| and then offload on a conveyor or something to other trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| that distribute it to another place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| It's a kind of a stop, reshuffle, and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| It's not a storage warehouse, as I think of that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| I'm not an expert in warehouses, but it strikes me that it may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| that PC2 is probably not the right zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| Obviously, Mr. Green and others, maybe Dan will want to talk to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| thought, well, by having a second BIDET review with a USAN review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| that gives a little more protection to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| but you will be marching inexorably down that road of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| it's a project that's underway, and what precautions do we take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| I didn't see any conditions put on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| I mean, if there had to be a condition, it would be that it protects water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7751)|
| 2:09:18| by treatment, collection treatment and other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| I mean, we are at the edge of Pandora's box in terms of environmental impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| on a farming community, on a scenic river area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| that's set aside in the development plans in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| for future recreational development just along the riverbanks there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| and what does this do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Maybe it does nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I know the science of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| water rush off of trucks in lots and stuff like that, but we do have steep land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7787)|
| 2:09:54| and all of our guidelines say caution, even don't build on steep land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| So I'm wondering whether we're in the right spot for this activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| and I'm inclined to vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| although I certainly appreciate having a FedEx or some other facility there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| because that does provide jobs and taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| But we're making a decision that will have future impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| and we need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| So that's my thoughts for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Dan and Jim Hagerman, I mean, how much scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| will it get with the hillside slope when you see the slopes we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| I mean, how much scrutiny is this going to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| and, you know, what limitations can be placed on a PC2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| Jim can better address the sinkhole issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| but with regard to the hillside plant, Dan Kelly and PC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| I will address that with regard to the hillside plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| Under the current C4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| the current zoning of the property, C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| the hillside plan will not come into play at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| They will be able to come in, apply for permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| and get their permits if they qualify under the city's normal permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Under the PC2 zoning that is being recommended by MPC to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| through the use and review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| that's where the hillside plan will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| It will be through the use and review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| So then the limitations that are placed on the hillside slope plan will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7891)|
| 2:11:38| You can't grade down the slopes that are greater than, is that what you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| We will take the adopted hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| and try to apply the principles of that plan in reviewing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| any project that comes in on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| One of the basic tenets in zoning is you're not rezoning this property for a particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7914)|
| 2:12:02| You're looking at this, whether or not the PC2 zoning is the appropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| for this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| Given what is currently zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| with so little oversight in place where you can actually control the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7935)|
| 2:12:24| given the amount of traffic that the proposed truck terminal would generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| you put three or four convenience stores out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| and they generate the same amount of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| or would generate more traffic most likely than a large facility such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| There are environmental issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| and we've discussed that in a meeting with the representatives from the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7963)|
| 2:12:49| and we are very concerned about the existence of the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| and how that's going to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| They may very well, once they get in there, and as Arthur noted earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| they're going to start doing their geologic work if this property gets rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| They may get in there and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| this is not going to be Site A for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| Then again, it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| but there will be a situation where there will be a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| that they will have to go through under the current city, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8001)|
| 2:13:26| and federal regulations controlling stormwater going into the groundwater system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| One of the other things about it, and Arthur said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| and it's very important, this is a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| The use or review process is a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| that it'll go to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| if you're dissatisfied with the decision of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| you can bring it to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| If you feel that our findings are not correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| or your findings are not correct when you hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| then they can appeal on into the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| Under the C-4 zone, the sinkhole stuff will still be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| but the hillside issues will not be a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| Would that be true under an I-3 as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| The P-C-2 gives you the most scrutiny and the most oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| to deal with hillside slope and these drainage issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| in coordination with city engineering, I would take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| When they made an application for I-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| the staff looked at that application and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| this could be an opportunity to get what we believe to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| an inappropriate, obsolete zone off of that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8075)|
| 2:14:41| I don't know that we're trying to check the box for FedEx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| What we're trying to do is put the appropriate zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| on that piece of property so the future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| of that property can be regulated and dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8090)|
| 2:14:54| in a fashion that the land is calling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| It's an ideal site right up against the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| for a trucking terminal or distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| You would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| It doesn't have to travel down other roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| They're on and off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| That's really almost ideal for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| On a flat piece of paper, it's an ideal site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| I think that to move this forward, I make a motion we approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| but we're trusting the public process and trusting your oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| on the hillside slope and the environmental conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| that this site may present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| I make a motion we approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| Okay, more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| Let me call on Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| He's not speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| I guess Mr. Wolfenbarger or Mr. Long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| would you like to address what Mr. Kelly said there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| Essentially what he was saying is if your concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| and I certainly have really big concerns about the amount of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| To get something like this on this property, the amount of grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| it gives me real heartburn and concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| I was leaning towards voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| But what Mr. Kelly was saying is that it would be the next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| would be a more appropriate site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| In terms of long-term protection and development of the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| it would be better at PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| So I'd like Mr. Wolfenbarger or Mr. Long to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8182)|
| 2:16:26| I think Mr. Kelly made it clear the zoning is not in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| with the existing plans, sector plan, general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| He said it was not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| I mean, C4 is not in compliance with your current plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| Right, but he's recommending the PC2 over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| Well, in the Knox County East County Sector Plan it says to prohibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| and then it goes on to say to reduce the extent of impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| That reducing the extent of impact could be to rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| as it was originally zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8216)|
| 2:16:58| When it came from the county to the city during the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| it was ag and open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| and that's where it should have come to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| But at that time, the city allowed billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| and the county did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| The body that was here at that time erred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| when they allowed those billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| allowed the C4 zoning specifically and only for billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8242)|
| 2:17:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| And now we have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| And so we're going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| My challenge is I think I only have two options, C4 or PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| To keep it C4 or to change it to PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| You know, frankly, from the community's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| we'd rather take our chances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| and we think it's a better chance on the C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| because of the development cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| Plus we get another opportunity to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| There are guidelines with C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| Now, are they as pristine as a PC2-1 or .1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| But we don't think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| We're confident that PC2 does not allow what they're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| without this opinion from Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| and this opinion from Mr. Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| But there's nowhere in PC2 that allows this kind of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| So that's our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| I think Mr. Long wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| He has a better perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| Well, I would just add that, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| the county sector plan speaks directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| to the question that you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| It states that where a preexisting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| And this is for hilltop, ridgetops that exceed 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| It says where a preexisting commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| or industrial zone property exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| consider a zoning overlay incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| to reduce extent and impacts of future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| The overlay's purpose would be to reduce the amount of grading and clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| and the incentives would be to cluster the development of the tops and slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| There's nothing in this PC2 that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| Certainly an overlay could be considered that would do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| that would better protect this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| I think our general concern is that moving from a C4 to a PC2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| in this case, for this particular purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| is a more intense zoning use than C4 would otherwise permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| in the nature of a trucking terminal or a freight terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| And for that reason, while PC sounds good on its face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| that you have a planned, considered open process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| in this particular case, if you get, using Councilman De La Volpe's term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| if you get half the camel under the tent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| it's a pretty serious camel, in our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| in this particular circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| So if council or if MPC needs to look at an overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| to bring this piece of property into accord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| or into line with what the Hillside Ridge Top Protection Plan requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| And I think that's what the community would ideally like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| But just moving to PC2 in order to begin the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| of permitting a freight terminal is not the answer to getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| That's moving us in a direction intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| to make a more intensive use of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| So you think the better long-term decision for the parcel is to keep it C4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| Keep it C4 with some protections that can be put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| as to the development of C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| And that needs to be looked at because, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| I think this parcel probably shouldn't be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| It probably shouldn't be industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| And I don't believe it should be PC2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| I obviously was not here, none of us were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| when the Commercial 4 went in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| But the intent of that, from what I understand from the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| who lived there, was to erect a couple billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| And for a couple billboards, it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| But given the scope of what C4 requires or permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| it doesn't make sense, and neither does industrial or PC2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| for a piece of property located on a ridgetop like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8465)|
| 2:21:13| Okay, Vice Mayor Grief, did you have your button?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| It won't go on. What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| You've used up your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| Why is his still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| It never goes off. It's stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| Vice Mayor Grief and Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| I understand what the community is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| They'd rather take a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| It's obvious that the property has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| It's also obvious that if you look at the plan for the freight terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| in terms of what they're going to have to do to that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| it's really astounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| And all you have to do is go up the interstate several more exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| and see what happened on the right-hand side where they mowed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| and it's still just sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| And I think that is the plan author to literally level the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8517)|
| 2:22:04| if, in fact, it's changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| I mean, to get this truck terminal in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| I mean, we have the plan, and if I take the plan and put it on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| it shows that I'm going to level this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| I'm going to let Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| Can you identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| Chris Miller, Skinnell Properties, 8801 River Crossing Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| Suite 300, Indianapolis, Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8549)|
| 2:22:33| The development plan is still a work in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| and obviously to construct a large facility like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| you have to level to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| And the amount of that is just solely determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| We still have the geologic information to see what is feasible and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| But obviously the size of that facility will require a fair amount of leveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| You can't have increasingly steep slopes within your site for safety purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| Trucks can't navigate that safely, or pedestrians within the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8577)|
| 2:23:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| Yes, I had a question about the type of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| You can come back, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8590)|
| 2:23:18| How many jobs are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| And I guess if it's connected with FedEx, they would be good-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| But tell me something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| Brian Rollins, 13727 Noel Road, Suite 1900, Dallas, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| Jobs day one, we're looking at about 170 total jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| It's about 145 full-time jobs and about another 40 part-time jobs, 40 to 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8619)|
| 2:23:48| From a yearly compensation, you know, payroll standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8628)|
| 2:23:52| we're looking at about $7.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| From an average salary standpoint, it's about around $60 to $65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| And from an hourly standpoint, they range from about $18 to $25 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| Councilman Dallaropi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| There was a question earlier that was asked, and it almost got to Jim Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| but he escaped for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| But the question is, I mean, you picture the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| They leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8665)|
| 2:24:26| Stuff comes out of them, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| It's going to wash somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| And, of course, the thought process that I heard from, I guess it was Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| or someone, was that it's going to wash into the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| It's going to go into the groundwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| It's going to be flushed or injected in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| It has to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| And, of course, we don't know what the actual topography would be once you get done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| leveling the world out there to make it, you know, good for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| But there is a pretty large grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| I think someone said 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| What do you guys foresee controlling that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| I mean, do you collect the water and run it through a processing plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| I mean, what do you do to keep from making a new nightmare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| Jim Hagerman, engineering director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| Any place that has sinkholes does have special considerations, whatever the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8715)|
| 2:25:24| Any modification, as mentioned before, any modification to a sinkhole requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8724)|
| 2:25:31| permits from TDEC before it even gets to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| But we regulate for amount of water and water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| You probably heard me say before or mention something called the water quality unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| and that's an enclosed unit that goes into the drainage system that settles out sediment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8748)|
| 2:25:59| has an oil-water separator, skimmer, and those would all be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| We would regulate both the amount of water that goes into the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8765)|
| 2:26:13| and the quality of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8773)|
| 2:26:19| And that's after TDEC takes a running shot at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| Is that what you said, that you get it second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Yeah, they have to have their TDEC permits before we even start taking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| Is that a discharge permit? What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| It's an aquatic resource alteration permit and or an injection well permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8792)|
| 2:26:44| And then you look at stormwater because you're concerned about flooding and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| We're concerned about flooding and we're concerned about water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| And, I mean, I don't know whether you weren't in this position at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| but do you know about all the work that we had to do at Ten Mile Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| The city spent mega-dollars trying to control the flooding that occurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| Are you talking about the Cross Park project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| Yeah, out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| Yeah, that was before your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| That was while I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| I mean, it started well before I was here, but the construction happened while I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| That was fixing errors of the past and how that area had been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| without an adequate drainage system more than issues specifically with sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8844)|
| 2:27:31| It wasn't sinkholes. It was just bad drainage planning over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| But are we going there again, I guess, is the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Well, we have much better regulation now than we did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| That was developed before anybody had as strong a regulation structure as we do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8861)|
| 2:27:49| but it was also developed in the county and we could bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| It was a little laxer with that sort of thing in those days than we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| and then we had those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8877)|
| 2:28:02| Can I ask Chris Miller a quick question if he's available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8882)|
| 2:28:06| Chris, you or maybe Arthur said we can't expand where we are on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8886)|
| 2:28:14| Is there no land where you could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| I mean, it's pretty flat down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| If you ever drive John Sevier Highway, it's pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| Is there no land that's better suited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| Obviously, you want to get closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| I guess it's Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8905)|
| 2:28:26| You want to get closer to the interstate and the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8906)|
| 2:28:29| That's the beauty of this site, but you go into a problem area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| You have an existing facility that I've ridden past down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| but you say you've kind of stretched and grown the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Is there no adjoining land that you just double the size of the operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| Again, Brian Rollins, great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| We have looked extensively at expanding the current location in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| There is some adjacent land that abuts at the end of the dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8933)|
| 2:29:00| and we cannot develop that because, for one, it does not meet the door capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| We've got a 60-door facility on about 15 acres that is an owned location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8945)|
| 2:29:11| and, for one, we cannot get the doors required by expanding on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| And additionally, with a size of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| What kind of door thing are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| Doors for this type of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8961)|
| 2:29:24| So we're talking about a freight terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8964)|
| 2:29:25| Close them off and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| There are 9 by 10 dock doors on each side of the truck terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| And we're currently in a 60-door terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| We're looking to build a 140-door day one terminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| So as opposed to square footage, the trucking companies go by doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| So that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| We cannot get our doors, and we cannot get our parking with the adjacent land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8984)|
| 2:29:49| As far as other properties, we have looked also extensively over the past, I'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8989)|
| 2:29:55| year and a half, two years at other sites in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| We have come up with other issues, but there are a number of factors that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=8999)|
| 2:30:06| when looking for truck terminal sites, size, zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| Then we look also from the development standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| and also a large portion of this is operationally, what is good for the client's operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9014)|
| 2:30:20| Currently, the stem miles from I-40 down to Forks of the River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| when you add up that mileage multiplied by the amount of trucks per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170829?start=9024)|
